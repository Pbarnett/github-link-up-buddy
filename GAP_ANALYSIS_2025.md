# AWS World-Class Standards Gap Analysis

## Overview
This document identifies the gaps against the AWS World-Class Standards Verification Checklist for the `github-link-up-buddy` project and provides key actions to achieve compliance with leading industry practices.

### 🔐 Security & Compliance

#### IAM
- **Least Privilege Access**
  - Implement a thorough review of IAM policies to ensure adherence to the least privilege principle.
- **Root Account Security**
  - Confirm the root account is secured with MFA and refrain from daily usage.
- **MFA Enforcement**
  - Enforce MFA for all IAM users.
- **Access Key Rotation**
  - Establish a 90-day rotation policy for all access keys.
- **Using IAM Roles**
  - Use IAM roles for cross-account access rather than sharing long-term credentials.

#### Encryption & Key Management
- **Data Encryption**
  - Confirm all data at rest is encrypted using AWS KMS; enable TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.
- **Managed Keys & Rotation**
  - Utilize customer-managed KMS keys and ensure that key rotation is automatically enabled.

### 🏗️ Architecture & Reliability

#### High Availability & Disaster Recovery
- **Multi-AZ & Multi-Region Deployments**
  - Implement resources across multiple availability zones and regions to enhance resilience.

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability

#### Logging & Monitoring
- **CloudTrail Configuration**
  - Enable CloudTrail in all regions for logging of all account activities.

### 💰 Cost Optimization

- **Comprehensive Resource Management**
  - Use tagging strategies for cost tracking and carry out regular cost optimization reviews.

### 🔄 DevOps & Automation

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Infrastructure as Code**
  - Define all infrastructure components through CloudFormation or CDK for version control and automation.

### 📋 Compliance & Governance

#### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR & PCI DSS**
  - Ensure all implementations adhere to GDPR and PCI DSS standards, especially in handling sensitive data and transactions.

### Summary
Efforts to fill these gaps will facilitate achieving a robust and compliant cloud infrastructure in accordance with AWS world-class standards, providing improved security, reliability, and operational efficiencies.
