## üéØ PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority (Critical for Production)
1. **Testing**: Address skipped tests (#49)

### Medium Priority (Important for Operations)
1. **Sentry**: Initialize in server functions (#32)
2. **Email**: Add detailed itinerary (#30)
3. **Saga Pattern**: Add compensation logic (#53)
4. **CI/CD**: Add Sentry release tagging (#43)

### Lower Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Blue-Green**: Implement proper deployment strategy (#45)

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

The emergency kill-switch functionality is now fully implemented and tested. The system has strong security controls, comprehensive data management, and proper cleanup mechanisms. Focus should shift to monitoring, validation, and operational excellence.
