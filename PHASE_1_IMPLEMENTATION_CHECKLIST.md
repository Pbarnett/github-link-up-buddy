## Implementation Order

### Week 1: Core Foundation
1. Enhance setup intent flow
2. Implement campaign-payment linking
3. Basic off-session charging

### Week 2: Error Handling & Webhooks
1. Enhanced error handling
2. Webhook integration
3. Notification system

### Week 3: Testing & Hardening
1. Comprehensive test suite
2. Edge case handling
3. Performance optimization

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Users can save multiple payment methods
