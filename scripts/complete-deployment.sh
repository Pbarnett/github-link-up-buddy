SET rollout_percentage = 5 
WHERE name = 'wallet_ui';
```

### Monitor Deployment
```bash
# Watch Grafana dashboards
# Monitor error rates and user engagement
# Verify wallet functionality for canary users
```

### Rollback if Needed
```sql
-- Emergency rollback
UPDATE feature_flags 
SET rollout_percentage = 0 
WHERE name = 'wallet_ui';
```
