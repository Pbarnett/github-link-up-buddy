# Parker Flight - Development Playbook
## User Profile & Wallet Implementation

### üéØ Executive Summary

This playbook outlines the 10-day AI-driven development approach for implementing an enterprise-grade user profile and wallet system for Parker Flight. The system prioritizes security, compliance, and user experience while maintaining rapid development velocity.

### üîê Guiding Principles

1. **Security First**: All payment data handled via Stripe tokenization (PCI SAQ A compliance)
2. **Lazy Stripe Customer Creation**: Create Stripe customers only when payment methods are added
3. **Row-Level Security**: Database policies ensure users only access their own data
4. **AWS Key Security**: Least-privilege principle - AWS keys restricted to KMS-encrypt/decrypt on parker-kms-key only
5. **Audit Everything**: Complete audit trails for all payment and profile actions
6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, enhance iteratively

### üìã Configuration & Schema

#### Core Tables Structure

```sql
-- User profiles with enhanced security
CREATE TABLE traveler_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  date_of_birth DATE,
  phone_number TEXT,
  phone_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  notification_preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Payment methods with KMS encryption
CREATE TABLE payment_methods (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  stripe_customer_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  stripe_payment_method_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  encrypted_card_data BYTEA NOT NULL,
  brand TEXT,
  last4 TEXT,
  exp_month SMALLINT,
  exp_year SMALLINT,
  is_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  encryption_version SMALLINT DEFAULT 2,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Profile completion tracking
CREATE TABLE profile_completion_tracking (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  completeness_score INT DEFAULT 0,
  missing_fields TEXT[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]::TEXT[],
  recommendations TEXT[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]::TEXT[],
  last_calculated TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id)
);

-- Audit logging for compliance
CREATE TABLE traveler_data_audit (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  table_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  record_id UUID,
  old_data JSONB,
  new_data JSONB,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Row-Level Security Policies

```sql
-- Payment methods RLS
ALTER TABLE payment_methods ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own payment methods"
  ON payment_methods FOR ALL
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Profile completion RLS
ALTER TABLE profile_completion_tracking ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own completion tracking"
  ON profile_completion_tracking FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
