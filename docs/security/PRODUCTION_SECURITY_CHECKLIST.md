# üîí Production Security Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Validation

Based on AWS KMS Developer Guide and Playwright performance testing capabilities, this checklist ensures production-ready security and performance standards.

- [ ] **Backup encryption** is configured

### ‚úÖ Application Security

#### 4. Input Validation
- [ ] **SQL injection** protection via parameterized queries
- [ ] **XSS prevention** through input sanitization

#### 6. Session Management
- [ ] **Secure cookie** attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- [ ] **Session timeout** implemented
- [ ] **Concurrent session** limits enforced
- [ ] **OAuth token** refresh mechanism
- [ ] **Logout functionality** clears all sessions

### ‚úÖ Performance & Monitoring

#### 7. Performance Benchmarks  
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals** meet Google standards:
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s
  - FID (First Input Delay) < 100ms
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1
- [ ] **API response times** < 300ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] **Database queries** optimized (< 50ms average)
- [ ] **Bundle size** < 1MB for initial load
- [ ] **Load testing** passed at 100 concurrent users

#### 8. Security Monitoring
- [ ] **Failed authentication** alerts configured
- [ ] **Unusual access patterns** detection
- [ ] **KMS key usage** monitoring enabled
- [ ] **Error rate** alerting (> 1% triggers alert)
- [ ] **Security scan** automation in CI/CD

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Security

#### 9. Network Security
- [ ] **VPC endpoints** configured for AWS services
- [ ] **Security groups** restrict unnecessary ports
- [ ] **Network ACLs** provide additional layer protection
- [ ] **DDoS protection** enabled
- [ ] **API Gateway** throttling configured

#### 10. Compliance & Auditing
- [ ] **Audit logging** captures all sensitive operations
- [ ] **CloudTrail** logging enabled for KMS operations
- [ ] **Compliance reports** automated
- [ ] **Penetration testing** completed
- [ ] **Vulnerability scanning** scheduled

### ‚úÖ Deployment Security

#### 11. CI/CD Security
- [ ] **Secrets management** via environment variables
- [ ] **Code signing** for deployment artifacts
- [ ] **Dependency scanning** for vulnerabilities
- [ ] **SAST/DAST** tools integrated
- [ ] **Container scanning** if using Docker

#### 12. Production Environment
- [ ] **Database backups** encrypted and tested
- [ ] **Disaster recovery** plan validated
- [ ] **Monitoring dashboards** deployed
- [ ] **Incident response** procedures documented
- [ ] **Security contact** information updated

## Quick Validation Commands

### Run Security & Performance Validation
```bash
./scripts/security-performance-validation.sh
```

### Check KMS Key Status
```bash
aws kms describe-key --key-id alias/parker-flight-production
aws kms get-key-rotation-status --key-id alias/parker-flight-production
```

### Validate RLS Policies
```bash
npx supabase db diff --local | grep -i "row level security"
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Load test critical endpoints
k6 run tests/load/personalization_k6.js

# Core Web Vitals check
npx playwright test tests/performance/core-vitals.spec.ts
```

### Security Headers Check
```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.com | grep -E "(X-Frame-Options|Content-Security-Policy|X-Content-Type-Options)"
```

## Critical Security Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Failed Login Rate | < 0.1% | TBD | ‚è≥ |
| API Error Rate | < 0.5% | TBD | ‚è≥ |
| KMS Key Rotations | Annual | TBD | ‚è≥ |
| Security Scan Score | > 90% | TBD | ‚è≥ |
| Load Test Pass Rate | 100% | TBD | ‚è≥ |

## Final Validation Steps

1. **Run the comprehensive validation script:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/security-performance-validation.sh
   ```

2. **Review all test results** in `test-results/security-performance/`

3. **Address any security failures** before deployment

4. **Deploy monitoring dashboards** for production oversight

5. **Schedule regular security audits** (monthly)
