### Attempted User Creation Methods

1. **Via Supabase Dashboard**:
   ```
   Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bbonngdyfyfjqfhvoljl
   → Authentication → Users → Add user
   Email: test.user@pf.dev
   Password: Passr0di
   Auto Confirm: YES
   Result: "Failed to create user: Database error checking email"
   ```

2. **Via Signup API**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://bbonngdyfyfjqfhvoljl.supabase.co/auth/v1/signup" \
     -H "apikey: YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"test.user@pf.dev","password":"Passr0di","data":{"first_name":"Test"}}'
   
   Result: {"code": 500, "error_code": "unexpected_failure", "msg": "Database error finding user"}
   ```

3. **Via Login API (testing existing auth)**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://bbonngdyfyfjqfhvoljl.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password" \
     -H "apikey: [same-key-as-above]" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"test.user@pf.dev","password":"Passr0di"}'
   
   Result: {"code": 500, "error_code": "unexpected_failure", "msg": "Database error querying schema"}
   ```

## Technical Context

### Migration History
We have attempted multiple database migrations to fix the auth schema:

#### Migration 1: Initial Cloud Fix (Failed)
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250711_cloud_fix_safe.sql
-- Issue: Referenced non-existent booking_attempts table
-- Error: column "user_id" does not exist in booking_attempts
```

#### Migration 2: Minimal Auth Fix (Partial Success)
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250711_cloud_auth_fix.sql
-- Created basic profiles table with RLS policies
-- Created auth trigger function
-- Result: Migration succeeded but user creation still failed
```

#### Migration 3: Comprehensive Auth Fix (Success + Still Failing)
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250712_complete_auth_fix.sql
-- Added UUID extensions: uuid-ossp, pgcrypto
-- Comprehensive profiles table with all columns
-- Enhanced RLS policies including service role access
-- Error-safe trigger function with exception handling
-- Test function: SELECT public.test_auth_setup();
-- Result: Migration successful, test function returned "Auth setup test successful at 2025-07-12 00:56:30.815394+00"
-- BUT: User creation still fails with same error
```

### Current Database Schema
After successful migrations, the database should have:

```sql
-- Extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";

-- Profiles table
CREATE TABLE public.profiles (
  id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
  email text,
  first_name text,
  last_name text,
  full_name text,
  avatar_url text
);

-- RLS enabled
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Comprehensive policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON public.profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON public.profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id) WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" ON public.profiles FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access" ON public.profiles FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role') WITH CHECK (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role');

-- Trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, first_name, full_name) 
  VALUES (
    new.id,
    new.email,
    COALESCE(new.raw_user_meta_data->>'first_name', split_part(new.email, '@', 1)),
    COALESCE(new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', new.raw_user_meta_data->>'first_name', split_part(new.email, '@', 1))
  );
  RETURN new;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN others THEN
    RAISE LOG 'Error creating profile for user %: %', new.id, SQLERRM;
    RETURN new;
END;
$$;

-- Trigger
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

Investigating the Supabase "Database error checking email" Issue
Overview of the Issue
When attempting to create new users in a Supabase Cloud project (via both the Dashboard and Auth API), the process fails with errors like "Database error checking email" (during sign-up) or similar messages such as "Database error finding user" (often on email confirmation) and "Database error querying schema" (on login). These errors indicate an internal failure in the database transaction during Supabase Auth operations, resulting in a 500 error and blocking user creation/authentication. In this particular case, the project has had custom schema migrations (adding a uuid extension, a profiles table, RLS policies, and a trigger function on auth.users for profile creation). Despite these migrations applying successfully and all custom SQL functions passing tests, no user can be created, pointing to an underlying misconfiguration or conflict with Supabase’s Auth system. This report will delve into the root causes of these errors and outline a comprehensive solution. We will cover common causes (like triggers or constraints on the auth.users table, or broken permissions), differences between Supabase Cloud and self-hosted setups that affect authentication, the impact of Dashboard configuration (SMTP settings, provider toggles, site URL, etc.), and how custom RLS policies or trigger functions might interfere with Supabase’s managed auth processes. We will also provide diagnostic SQL queries to help pinpoint issues, a step-by-step plan to fix the problem (with SQL and dashboard changes), as well as strategies to prevent such issues in future projects.
Common Causes of "Database error checking email" and Variants
The error messages are generic, but they usually stem from failures in the database operations that Supabase Auth (GoTrue) performs when handling user sign-up, login, or confirmation. Supabase’s Auth system is tightly integrated with the Postgres database (using the auth schema). A “Database error…” message means something went wrong during these DB queries. Some known root causes include:
Trigger Functions on auth.users – A custom trigger on the auth.users table (for example, to insert a row into a profiles table upon user creation) can cause this error if the trigger fails. This is one of the most frequent causes of the "Database error saving new user" issue
supabase.com
github.com
. If the trigger’s operation is not permitted or throws an exception, the entire sign-up transaction is rolled back with a generic error. (We will discuss why triggers often fail in a Supabase context in the next section.)
Constraints on auth.users – Adding extra constraints (unique keys, NOT NULL requirements, foreign keys, etc.) on the auth.users table can interfere with Supabase’s expected behavior. For example, if a constraint isn’t met during user creation, the insert will error. Supabase’s docs note that an unmet custom constraint on auth.users is a common cause of these errors
supabase.com
. For instance, making a column non-null or adding a strict foreign key could block the insertion if Supabase doesn’t supply those values immediately.
Permissions / Auth Schema Misalignment (often due to Prisma or manual schema changes) – If the default permissions or structure of the auth schema have been altered, Supabase’s Auth microservice might no longer be able to query or insert into the auth tables. The Supabase team specifically calls out using Prisma migrations against the auth schema as a culprit: “using Prisma… has broken all the permissions on the auth.users table”
supabase.com
. In other words, if an external tool dropped/recreated auth.users or altered privileges, the internal roles Supabase uses (like supabase_auth_admin) may no longer have the necessary access. This can lead to errors when Supabase tries to check for an existing email or create a user and is denied permission. (In one GitHub issue, after running prisma migrate reset, every attempt to create a user in Supabase UI resulted in “Failed to create user: Database error checking email”
github.com
.)
Missing or Misconfigured Auth Tables – Supabase relies on certain system tables in the auth schema (notably auth.users and auth.identities). If these were dropped or renamed (even temporarily during a migration), or if required extensions are missing, the Auth service might malfunction. For example, the uuid-ossp or pgcrypto extension is typically installed to support UUID generation; if the auth.users.id default relies on a function from an extension that isn’t enabled, inserts could fail. (In your case, you did include UUID extension migration, so this is likely okay.)
Supabase Auth Schema Changes Across Versions – Although less common, if there’s a version mismatch (e.g., a self-hosted instance with an older auth schema vs. the cloud’s expectations), certain fields might not align. For instance, Supabase added phone-auth fields (like phone, phone_confirmed_at) in late 2022; if a migration accidentally removed or renamed these, the Auth service’s queries (which select columns like phone_confirmed_at) could fail with a schema error. A “sql: Scan error” or "error querying schema" could result if the columns don’t match what the GoTrue server expects – but this is typically only an issue if one manually altered the auth.users definition.
In summary, the error is usually a side-effect of a database transaction issue or permission problem during user creation or lookup
supabase.com
. Next, we’ll explore how specific customizations (triggers, RLS, etc.) can lead to these issues, especially in Supabase Cloud.
Supabase Auth Architecture: Roles, Permissions, and Schema Expectations
To understand why certain changes cause these errors, it’s important to know how Supabase Auth interacts with the database in Supabase Cloud:
The auth schema and its tables (auth.users, auth.identities, etc.) are managed by Supabase’s Auth service (a fork of GoTrue). The auth.users table stores user accounts. Supabase does not expose this schema via the public API for security reasons. Instead, if developers need user data in their own schema, they typically create a parallel table (like public.profiles) and use triggers or APIs to keep it in sync
supabase.com
.
Supabase Cloud uses dedicated Postgres roles for its internal services. Notably, supabase_auth_admin is the role that the Auth service uses to perform admin-level operations on the auth schema (such as creating new users). This role is highly privileged on the auth schema but not necessarily elsewhere. It is not a superuser and is limited to what it needs for auth. There are also roles like authenticated, anon for client usage, and a service_role for full admin access via API keys. The supabase_auth_admin role typically owns or has full rights on the auth schema objects by default.
Default permissions: When a Supabase project is created, the platform sets up grants so that supabase_auth_admin can SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE on auth.users (and identities, etc.). If the auth.users table is dropped and re-created (e.g., by a Prisma migration that maps the auth schema), those grants might be lost, and the table ownership might change. For example, if a migration user owns the new table and did not re-grant privileges to supabase_auth_admin, then when the Auth service attempts to query or insert, it hits a permissions error, surfacing as "Database error…". This scenario is exactly what the Supabase team warns about with external ORMs: Prisma’s default behavior can strip away the carefully set permissions
supabase.com
.
System triggers and functions: Supabase’s auth system itself doesn’t add triggers on auth.users by default (aside from any internal triggers within the GoTrue service which are not visible in the DB). However, developers often add their own triggers on auth.users (for example, to populate a profiles table). These triggers become part of the database transaction when a user is created. If they fail for any reason, the user creation will fail. It’s crucial to implement such triggers in a way that doesn’t conflict with Supabase’s limited-role execution (discussed below).
Row Level Security (RLS) on auth schema: By default, the auth schema tables have no RLS policies – and they don’t need them because they’re not accessible via the auto-generated API. The Supabase Auth service operates with its roles and bypasses any need for RLS on its own tables. If one attempted to enable RLS on auth.users and did not configure policies for supabase_auth_admin or other roles, it could block the Auth service’s queries (“checking email” is essentially a SELECT on auth.users to see if an email exists). In a self-hosted environment, some advanced users experiment with RLS on auth for multi-tenant setups, but it’s not a standard configuration and can easily cause issues if misconfigured
supabase.com
. In short, RLS should generally remain disabled on auth.users. Instead, RLS is applied to your copy of user data (e.g., public.profiles) in most setups.
Auth schema integrity: Supabase expects that the structure of auth.users remains as delivered (all default columns present, with their types). If a migration removed columns (as one ill-advised Prisma migration attempted to do
medium.com

), the Auth service would obviously break. Ensuring that fields like raw_app_meta_data, encrypted_password, etc., are present is important even if you don’t use them directly.
In the given project, the presence of a custom trigger and RLS policies suggests that the primary suspects for the "Database error checking email" are the trigger function on auth.users and any permissions or RLS issues it introduces. We will examine how triggers and RLS can cause permission errors in Supabase Cloud.
How Triggers and RLS Can Interfere with Supabase Auth
One of the most common patterns in Supabase projects is creating a trigger on auth.users to populate a profile in another schema (often the public.profiles table) whenever a new user signs up. Supabase even provides a starter template for this in their SQL editor (“User Management” template) which creates a public.profiles table and an handle_new_user() trigger function. However, if done incorrectly, this trigger can block user creation, causing the exact errors we’re seeing. Why do triggers on auth.users often cause "Database error" issues? The key is who executes the trigger. In Supabase Cloud, when a user is created via the Auth service, the insertion into auth.users is performed by the supabase_auth_admin role (not by the anonymous or authenticated role). By default, this role’s permissions are scoped to the auth schema – it does not automatically have rights to modify tables in other schemas like public
supabase.com
. If your trigger function tries to insert into public.profiles, the database will attempt that insert as supabase_auth_admin. Without additional setup, that role likely has no INSERT privilege on public.profiles (and if RLS is enabled on public.profiles, it also won’t satisfy any policy by default). The result is a permission error on the profiles table, which aborts the transaction. This is exactly the scenario described in Supabase’s documentation and discussions: “when a trigger operated by the supabase_auth_admin interacts outside the auth schema, it causes a permission error.”
supabase.com
 In a forum discussion, a maintainer noted that “almost always [this error] is a trigger function on auth.users… Check your Postgres logs…” and indeed the user found “permission denied for table profiles” in their logs
github.com
github.com
. This confirms that the trigger tried to insert into a table without proper rights. How to fix trigger permission issues: The recommended solution is to create the trigger’s function with SECURITY DEFINER, owned by a superuser (the postgres role)
supabase.com
supabase.com
. Security definer means the function will run with the privileges of its owner rather than the caller. If you create the function as the database owner (which in Supabase is a high-privilege role, effectively an admin), then when supabase_auth_admin calls the function via the trigger, the function executes with the admin’s rights. This allows it to insert into public.profiles (or any other table) regardless of supabase_auth_admin’s limited permissions
supabase.com
medium.com
. In addition, as seen in Supabase’s examples, it’s wise to specify SET search_path = '' in the function definition and qualify all table names with schema (to avoid any malicious schema switching)
medium.com
medium.com
. Supabase’s official User Management template uses exactly this approach: a public.handle_new_user() function defined as SECURITY DEFINER (owner postgres) and the trigger calls that
supabase.com
supabase.com
. Using this pattern, the trigger will no longer throw permission errors, since it bypasses RLS and schema permissions by running as a superuser. If your current trigger function was not created with security definer (or if you created it via a migration where it might be owned by a role without superuser rights), that could be the cause of the failure. The fix is to drop the trigger (and possibly the function) and recreate them with the proper security context
supabase.com
supabase.com
. For example (simplified from Supabase docs):
sql
Copy
drop trigger if exists on_auth_user_created on auth.users;
drop function if exists public.handle_new_user() cascade;

create function public.handle_new_user()
returns trigger 
language plpgsql 
security definer set search_path = ''
as $$
begin
  insert into public.profiles(id, full_name, avatar_url)
  values ( new.id,
           new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name',
           new.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url' );
  return new;
end;
$$;

create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
The above pattern (from Supabase’s example) will ensure the trigger can insert into public.profiles without a hitch
supabase.com
supabase.com
. What about RLS policies? If you have enabled RLS on the public.profiles table (which is recommended for normal app usage), you might wonder how the insert works for an admin role. By default, Postgres bypasses RLS for roles with the BYPASSRLS attribute (superusers), so if the definer is postgres (a superuser), the insert ignores any RLS policies on public.profiles. This is desired in this case – you want the profile row created regardless of policies. Regular clients would still be constrained by RLS when querying or updating profiles, but the system trigger can populate it freely. If, for some reason, the definer is not superuser, you’d need to ensure the definer role has rights or is excepted in the RLS policy (one could include OR auth.role() = 'supabase_auth_admin' in a policy, but using a superuser definer is simpler and more secure). To summarize: A trigger function on auth.users must be carefully set up with elevated privileges, or else it will cause a “database error saving new user” because the internal auth role cannot complete the trigger’s actions
supabase.com
supabase.com
. This likely explains the error in our scenario – the “Database error checking email” appears at the very start of the sign-up because something (the trigger or a prior check) fails. In fact, if the trigger fails after insertion, the client might see a slightly different message; however, the Supabase Auth API often checks for an existing email before attempting insert, and if the previous user creation attempt left a half-created user or the email-check query fails due to permissions, it can also produce a "checking email" error. The internal logs would confirm the exact point of failure.
Other Potential Factors: Dashboard Configurations and Settings
While the database trigger is the prime suspect, we should also rule out (or address) Dashboard configuration issues that could cause similar symptoms:
SMTP Settings and Email Confirmation: If custom SMTP is enabled but misconfigured, sending the confirmation email might fail. Normally, an SMTP failure would surface as an “Error sending email” rather than a generic database error. Supabase’s Auth logs or UI might show a specific error about email. In our case, the error message explicitly says “Database error…”, suggesting a DB issue rather than an email send failure. Nonetheless, check if Enable Email Confirmations is on and if you have a custom SMTP configured. If you toggled on custom SMTP without valid credentials, try disabling it (Supabase will use its default email service for confirmations) to see if user creation succeeds. A mis-set SMTP alone typically would not throw a database error, but ensuring email delivery is properly set is important for the sign-up flow (users clicking confirmation links). Also verify the Site URL in Settings → Auth → Config. An invalid Site URL can lead to broken confirmation links. Usually it doesn’t prevent user creation (the user is created along with a confirm token even if the link might be wrong), but to be safe, set the Site URL to your app’s URL (or a placeholder during development) as recommended.
Auth Provider Enablement: If email/password sign-ups are disabled (there is a setting “Disable Signups” if using invites only), then attempts to sign up would be rejected. However, the error for disabled signups is usually a clear message (HTTP 400 with “Signups not allowed” or similar), not a 500. Since our error is a 500, it indicates the service tried and failed, not that it was disallowed by config. Still, double-check that “Enable email signups” is turned on (in the Dashboard Auth settings). Likewise, if you are using a third-party provider, ensure it’s configured properly. (Misconfiguration there wouldn’t produce a "checking email" error though – it would fail in the OAuth handshake instead.)
Email Confirmation Toggle: If Enable Email Confirmations is true (the default), the sign-up flow requires the user to confirm via email. If it’s false, users are auto-confirmed. In either case, the initial user record insertion happens. The only difference is confirmation_token and confirmation_sent_at fields. A bug or conflict could arise if, say, a trigger or constraint expected email_confirmed_at to be non-null immediately. For example, if someone added a constraint that email_confirmed_at must be set (not null), then with confirmations enabled, new users wouldn’t have that set and the insert would violate the constraint – causing a DB error. This is a hypothetical scenario of a custom constraint issue. Review any constraints you added on auth.users or a related table.
Invites vs. Signups: Supabase allows inviting users (which creates a user entry with an invited_at but no password, and sends a different email link). If you were testing via the Dashboard’s "Invite User" or "Add User" feature, note that those also trigger the same underlying logic. The error “Database error saving new user” is common if triggers fail, whether it’s an invite or a direct sign-up. (The Dashboard uses an admin API call under the hood, which in either case inserts into auth.users.)
Site URL and Confirmation Links: As noted, ensure Site URL is configured; a malformed confirmation link template can lead to errors at verification time (like "Database error finding user from email link" if the token is not passed correctly). In one Stack Overflow case, a user had a custom email template with an incorrect URL and it caused a "Database error finding user from email link" on confirmation – the fix was to use the {{ .ConfirmationURL }} template variable properly
stackoverflow.com
. This might not apply to your situation unless you edited email templates. But keep it in mind: if you see errors during the email confirmation step (after clicking the link, as opposed to during initial sign-up), ensure the email template is correct.
In summary, misconfigurations in the dashboard are less likely to cause a "checking email" error at sign-up, but they can affect the flow. It’s still good to verify: sign-ups are enabled, the Site URL is set, email templates are correct, and SMTP (if used) is working. Once the database-level issues are resolved, these settings ensure a smooth auth process.
Differences Between Supabase Cloud and Self-Hosted Environments
The environment where this issue occurs is Supabase Cloud. It’s worth noting how that contrasts with running Supabase Auth in a self-hosted setup (e.g., the Supabase CLI local Docker or a custom GoTrue instance):
Role and Permission Model: In Supabase Cloud, you cannot alter the fundamental roles – supabase_auth_admin exists with limited rights, and postgres (the actual superuser) is not directly accessible to you except through the migration system or internal actions. On a self-hosted instance, you might inadvertently be operating as the postgres superuser for convenience, which can mask permission issues. For example, if you test your trigger by manually inserting a row into auth.users as the postgres role, it will succeed (since postgres can insert into profiles regardless of RLS). But when the GoTrue container (running as a less privileged role) tries it, it fails. In Cloud, you’re always going through the service which uses supabase_auth_admin, so the issue becomes immediately apparent. In short, Cloud’s managed roles enforce the principle of least privilege, exposing any permission missteps, whereas a local dev environment might hide them if you use a superuser accidentally during testing. This might explain why “all schema and function tests pass” in your migration (possibly executed as an admin role), yet the real sign-ups fail.
UI and Management: Supabase Cloud’s dashboard has certain guardrails. Notably, the Dashboard does not allow creating triggers on auth.users via the UI – this was intentionally disabled because many users unknowingly broke their auth setup with triggers
reddit.com
. You can still create them via SQL scripts (as you did), but the UI won’t guide inexperienced users into a trap. Self-hosted or older setups didn’t have this restriction in the UI. Cloud also provides the Auth and Postgres Log explorers in the Dashboard, which are extremely useful for debugging these errors
supabase.com
. On a local setup, you’d check Docker logs or supabase logs for similar info.
Managed Updates: In Cloud, Supabase automatically keeps the Auth service up-to-date and the auth schema migrated. On self-hosted, if you upgrade the Docker image, migrations might need to be applied. A cloud user doesn’t worry about that. This means in Cloud, it’s unlikely your auth schema is out-of-sync with the Auth service version. In self-hosted, if someone manually modified the auth schema or didn’t apply an update, mismatches could cause errors (like expecting a column that isn’t there). Given that you’re on Cloud, we assume the schema was standard until your migrations – so any schema misalignment is likely due to your changes, not missing a Supabase update.
Workarounds: In a self-hosted environment, if auth was broken by a migration, one could potentially fix it by re-running the init scripts or using a supabase CLI command to repair roles. In Cloud, if things like grants are broken, you’ll have to manually execute SQL (or contact Supabase support). Fortunately, the fixes are straightforward (e.g., re-granting permissions or recreating a table to restore defaults). One interesting tip from a user: disabling and re-enabling the Auth providers in the Dashboard can reset the auth.users table in dev environments
medium.com
 (this likely deletes all users and recreates necessary structure). This is a destructive action (would wipe users) and should be done only if you’re okay with that. It might internally attempt to reapply default grants too. But manual SQL control is preferable for surgical fixes.
Default Data and Extensions: Supabase Cloud comes preloaded with certain extensions (uuid-ossp, pgcrypto, etc.) and default data. In local, you might need to enable them yourself. In your case, you added uuid_extension; Cloud usually has gen_random_uuid() via pgcrypto by default (Supabase might use gen_random_uuid() internally instead of uuid_generate_v4(), but either extension works). There isn’t much difference here, except that Cloud likely already had uuid-ossp enabled (the extension addition in migration may have been a no-op). This is more of a footnote: lack of required extensions can cause database function errors, but those usually appear as undefined function or similar, not as "Database error checking email."
To summarize, the core difference is in roles/permissions: Supabase Cloud enforces the use of a special limited role for Auth operations, whereas a self-hosted environment might inadvertently let you operate as a superuser. The Cloud environment therefore requires that triggers and policies be configured with those role limitations in mind. The good news is that following best practices (security definer functions, proper grants) will solve the issue in Cloud and still work in self-hosted. The next sections provide a plan to diagnose and fix the specific issue and ensure all these pieces line up correctly.
Diagnostic Steps and SQL Queries
To confirm assumptions and pinpoint the exact cause, here are some diagnostic SQL queries and steps you can run (using the Supabase SQL editor or psql). These will help verify the state of your auth schema and related configurations:
Check for permission errors in logs: Before SQL, use the Dashboard’s Auth Logs and Postgres Logs explorer. Look for entries around the time of a failed signup. The Postgres log will likely have a detailed error message. For example, an error like “permission denied for table profiles” or “new row for relation 'users' violates check constraint …” will directly reveal the problem
github.com
. This is the quickest way to identify if it’s a trigger permission issue, a constraint, etc. The Auth log might show something like “error finding user: sql error” with details.
List triggers on auth.users: Run:
sql
Copy
SELECT tgname, pg_get_triggerdef(oid) 
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass;
This will show any trigger definitions on the auth.users table. You should see your trigger (e.g., on_auth_user_created). Check if it’s an AFTER INSERT trigger as expected. We want to verify only the intended trigger exists and see which function it calls.
Inspect the trigger function: Find the function source with:
sql
Copy
SELECT proname, proowner::regrole AS owner, prosecdef AS security_definer, pg_get_functiondef(oid) 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'handle_new_user';  -- or your function name
Key things to note: security_definer should be true (prosecdef = true) – if false, the function is security invoker (which would explain the permission issue). Also note the owner: ideally it should be postgres (or whichever admin role is the database owner). If it’s owned by authenticated or another lesser role, that could be a problem – you’d want to change the owner to postgres or recreate the function as such. The pg_get_functiondef will show the entire function body; double-check that it includes security definer and set search_path='' in its definition. If not, that function was not created with those attributes (even if you wrote them in the SQL, a common mistake is forgetting the SECURITY DEFINER clause or the clause not applying if not superuser).
Verify grants on public.profiles (or relevant tables): Since the trigger writes to public.profiles, ensure that table exists and has the expected structure. Then check if supabase_auth_admin has privileges:
sql
Copy
SELECT grantee, privilege_type 
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants 
WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='profiles' AND grantee='supabase_auth_admin';
It’s likely this returns no rows (meaning no explicit grants to that role), which is expected – we want the security definer to handle it, not direct grants. If you did attempt a workaround by granting permissions manually, we’d see it here. (If you see INSERT granted to supabase_auth_admin, the trigger might succeed even without security definer, but granting broad rights is less ideal than using definer).
Check RLS on public.profiles: Confirm if Row Level Security is enabled on the profiles table and what the policies are:
sql
Copy
SELECT relrowsecurity 
FROM pg_class 
WHERE relname='profiles' AND relnamespace = 'public'::regnamespace;
A value of t indicates RLS is enabled. Then:
sql
Copy
SELECT policyname, permissive, roles, using_clause, with_check_clause 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname='public' AND tablename='profiles';
Review the policies. Typically, you’d have something like an “Enable read access to profiles for authenticated users where id = auth.uid()” and a similar policy for updates, etc. Ensure there isn’t a policy that could be blocking inserts by a role like supabase_auth_admin. Usually, if using definer, the insert bypasses RLS anyway. If not using definer, one hack could be to add a policy: PERMISSIVE INSERT FOR role supabase_auth_admin USING (true) to allow that role to insert. But this shouldn’t be necessary if the function is correct.
Check the auth.users table structure: Verify that all expected columns exist and have correct data types. You can run:
sql
Copy
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema='auth' AND table_name='users';
Look for anomalies: e.g., any column missing that you expect (compare with Supabase docs or a fresh project). Important ones: id UUID PK, aud, role, email, encrypted_password, confirmed_at/email_confirmed_at/phone_confirmed_at, invited_at, phone, raw_app_meta_data (JSON), raw_user_meta_data (JSON), timestamps, etc. If something like email_confirmed_at or phone is missing, it means your migrations might have dropped it. (Given you mentioned enabling UUID extension and creating profiles and policies, you probably didn’t modify auth.users columns via migrations – unless you used Prisma introspection which can inadvertently drop things it doesn’t know about. The Medium article snippet shows Prisma wanted to drop many columns it didn’t map
medium.com
; hopefully you avoided that scenario.)
Count users or test basic query: As a sanity check, see if any user exists:
sql
Copy
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users;
This should return 0 if none were created successfully. If it’s >0, then perhaps some user was partially created (for example via an invite or a previous test) – in that case, check if their email is what you were testing with, as it could cause “email already exists” errors. Also, try a simple select as the supabase_auth_admin role to mimic the "checking email" step:
sql
Copy
-- Run as service role or in SQL Editor which defaults to an admin role:
set role supabase_auth_admin;
select * from auth.users where email = 'test@example.com';
If this SELECT fails with a permission error, it means supabase_auth_admin somehow lost SELECT rights on its own table (which should not happen unless Prisma meddled with grants). Normally, supabase_auth_admin owns or has full rights on auth.users. A permission error here would be a huge red flag that grants need to be fixed (we would then do a GRANT ALL ON auth.users TO supabase_auth_admin;). If it selects fine (likely it will), then the "checking email" error is not because supabase_auth_admin can’t read auth.users – it’s more likely because the trigger’s previous failure left a transaction in error or a partial user in place. GoTrue might be trying to check if the email exists (and it might, if a user row was inserted then rolled back or something odd). Typically, though, if a trigger fails, the whole insert is rolled back, so no user should exist.
Constraints on auth.users: List any non-default constraints (aside from the primary key) on auth.users:
sql
Copy
SELECT conname, pg_get_constraintdef(oid) 
FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass;
The default Supabase constraints are primary key on id, unique index on identities(email) perhaps, and some check constraints on email lowercase maybe (depending on version). If you added something like CHECK(email ~* 'regex') or a foreign key to another table, etc., examine those. For instance, if you added a foreign key from auth.users.id to public.profiles.id (instead of the other way around), that could create a circular dependency or insertion order problem (though typically one would reference auth.users from profiles, not vice versa). Ensure any foreign keys are on the profiles table referencing auth.users, with ON DELETE CASCADE as recommended
supabase.com
, and not the opposite.
By running and analyzing these queries, you should be able to confirm the root cause. For example, if the logs and the function inspection show a permission issue on insert into profiles, we’ve nailed it. Or if you find a surprise constraint violation in logs, you know to focus there. Given the evidence and known common causes, it’s very likely the trigger function needs to be adjusted to use security definer and bypass RLS/permissions, and possibly the RLS policy on profiles needs to allow the insert (which using a definer will inherently solve).
Solution Plan
Based on the investigation, here’s a step-by-step plan to resolve the issue and restore the ability to create users. The plan addresses the trigger permission issue, ensures the auth schema permissions are correct, and considers fallbacks if needed: 1. Fix the auth.users trigger function (or temporarily disable it):
Apply Security Definer: If the diagnostic confirmed the trigger function was not using SECURITY DEFINER, the primary fix is to recreate it with the proper security context. Using the template from Supabase docs
supabase.com
supabase.com
 (as shown earlier), adjust your trigger function. Make sure to create it as an AUTHENTICATED/ADMIN user (in the SQL editor, you are effectively an admin), so that the function owner will be the postgres role on Cloud. For example:
sql
Copy
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.handle_new_user() CASCADE;
CREATE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER 
SET search_path = ''
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- insert into profile table (adjust columns as needed)
  INSERT INTO public.profiles(id, full_name, avatar_url)
  VALUES ( NEW.id,
           NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name',
           NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url' );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
(Adapt the insert to use your actual profiles schema/fields. Also include any additional fields you want to copy from metadata, or set defaults as needed.)
Why drop and recreate? Dropping the trigger first ensures no duplicate trigger. Dropping the function with CASCADE will drop the existing trigger as well (since it depends on the function). Then you recreate both. This guarantees the new trigger uses the new function definition. After doing this, attempt to sign up a new user again. If the trigger was the culprit, this time the user creation should succeed (the profile row will be inserted by the definer function without permission issues).
Temporary disable option: If you want to confirm the trigger was the problem before recreating it, you could simply disable or drop the trigger and then try creating a user. For example: ALTER TABLE auth.users DISABLE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created;. Then create a user (via Dashboard or API). If it succeeds without error (though it won’t create a profile, obviously), that strongly indicates the trigger was causing the error. You can then re-enable it (or drop and recreate as above). This is a quick way to verify cause and effect.
2. Repair Permissions (if needed):
Auth schema grants: If Prisma or other migrations meddled with privileges on auth.users, we should re-grant them. The default is that supabase_auth_admin should be the owner or have ALL on the table. On Supabase Cloud, the owner of auth.users might be a system role, but supabase_auth_admin is typically a member of a role that owns it. In any case, it doesn’t hurt to run:
sql
Copy
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA auth TO supabase_auth_admin;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON auth.users TO supabase_auth_admin;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON auth.identities TO supabase_auth_admin;
This ensures the auth service role can fully access the tables. If these grants already exist or supabase_auth_admin is owner, the commands will have no effect or harmlessly affirm privileges. (If you receive an error running these, you might not have permission as a user to grant – but as the project owner you should.)
Check for other auth tables: Supabase Auth might also use auth.identities (for OAuth identities). Prisma migrations sometimes drop and recreate that. Make sure it exists and has similar grants. Also, ensure no unexpected dependencies: e.g., if auth.users.id sequence or default got removed. By default, user IDs are set by the application (GoTrue generates a UUID) so the DB doesn’t need a sequence. Just verify id is UUID and likely with default gen_random_uuid() or not null.
Profile table RLS policy: If after fixing the trigger, you still see issues, it could be that during the trigger execution, a policy on public.profiles is blocking the insert. Normally, with security definer as postgres, this shouldn’t matter (superuser bypasses RLS). But what if the function owner isn’t actually postgres? On Cloud, the “postgres” role exists but your executing user might be a different admin role. To be safe, you could explicitly allow the auth admin role in the profiles policies. For example:
sql
Copy
CREATE POLICY allow_auth_admin_insert ON public.profiles
FOR INSERT TO supabase_auth_admin
WITH CHECK (true);
This says supabase_auth_admin can insert regardless of row content (the check always passes). This should only be needed if for some reason the trigger didn’t bypass RLS. You can remove or adjust this policy later if it’s not needed. (Alternatively, set the function to SECURITY DEFINER and inside the function, do EXECUTE AS OWNER – but that’s essentially what we did.)
Constraints adjustments: Remove or alter any problematic constraints on auth.users. If, hypothetically, you added a constraint like CHECK (email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL), drop it – it doesn’t make sense at insert time when users aren’t confirmed yet. Likewise, if you tried to enforce a unique email constraint at the DB level, know that Supabase already prevents duplicate emails within the same tenant (the Auth service does a query and returns an error if found). A manual unique constraint on email could conflict with how Supabase handles case sensitivity or multi-tenancy (the aud field is the “audience” or tenant identifier). If you had added UNIQUE(email) on auth.users, consider dropping it, or at least make it UNIQUE(email, aud) because in theory the same email could exist in two different aud (though by default all users use the auth audience). In general, rely on Supabase to handle duplicate emails (it returns a specific error code for that), and avoid custom constraints on the auth schema unless absolutely necessary.
3. Test User Creation via Dashboard and Auth API: After implementing the above fixes, test creating a new user in multiple ways:
Via Dashboard: Go to Auth → Users → “Add User”. Try creating a user with an email and password. It should succeed (no error popup). If email confirmations are on, this will create the user in a WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION state (with a confirmation email sent). If off, the user will be fully created. Check that this succeeded and see that a corresponding row appeared in public.profiles (the trigger’s action). If the profile row is created and no errors thrown, the trigger issue is resolved.
Via API: Use the Supabase JS client or curl to call the sign-up endpoint. For example:
js
Copy
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({ email: "test@example.com", password: "pass123" });
Expect error to be null on success. If this is a duplicate email from a previous attempt, you might get a “user already registered” (DuplicateEmail) error – use a fresh email each test or delete any partially created user from the Dashboard first.
Email confirmation flow: If confirmations are required, complete the flow – click the link in the email or use supabase.auth.verifyOtp() with the token. Ensure that confirmation succeeds and doesn’t throw a "finding user" error. With our fixes, it should work. If a "Database error finding user from email link" does occur, double-check the email template URL as mentioned earlier, but that’s likely separate from the trigger issue.
4. Implement Fallbacks if Issues Persist: If, for some reason, users still cannot be created, consider these fallback strategies while continuing to troubleshoot:
Disable the trigger function entirely as a stop-gap so at least users can sign up. You can drop the trigger (and maybe use a manual process to populate profiles later). This isn’t ideal, but user auth is usually higher priority than immediately having a profile row. With the trigger gone, does sign-up work? If yes, the problem definitely lies in that trigger or its function environment. You can then rebuild it carefully.
Use the Service Role to insert users: This is more of a programmatic workaround. The Supabase Admin API (or supabase.auth.admin in code) using the service key can create users bypassing RLS. If the normal signUp continues failing, one could use the service key to call the admin create user endpoint. However, in our case, the Dashboard itself uses the admin path, and that was failing – indicating the issue is in the database layer not the client-side. So switching to service role in client won’t fix a DB trigger problem. It’s more relevant if, say, you wanted to skip the trigger by doing your own user insertion via a SQL function call with the service role.
Contact Supabase support: If logs are not illuminating and the issue is in a weird state, Supabase support can often help by examining the project’s internal state. Given we have a solid idea that it’s triggers/permissions, this is likely not needed. But for completeness, if something like the auth schema got corrupted, support could potentially reset the auth schema for your project (which would delete users, so be cautious).
5. Monitoring and Future Prevention: Once the immediate issue is resolved (users can be created again), consider these preventive measures for the future:
Always test with actual sign-up flows after schema changes: As learned, a migration that works in isolation (e.g., running a function as a superuser in a test) might break the real flow. After deploying any migration that touches auth or related tables, perform a quick end-to-end test: sign up a new user, confirm email, sign in, etc. This will catch issues early.
Follow Supabase's examples for auth triggers: Use the provided templates or documentation as a baseline. They demonstrate the correct use of security definer and proper schema references
supabase.com

. If you copy that pattern, you’ll avoid the permission trap. As a rule: any trigger on auth.users that accesses another schema must use a security definer function owned by an admin.
Be careful with ORMs and the auth schema: It’s generally recommended not to manage the auth schema with Prisma or other external migration tools. If you do, use Prisma’s ignoreRelations or only introspect for reading, not migrating. Supabase’s official Prisma guidance suggests creating a separate PostgreSQL role for Prisma that has access only to the public schema
supabase.com
, precisely to prevent it from meddling with auth. If you need to represent auth tables in Prisma for queries, mark them as @@map to existing tables and do not let Prisma migrate them. In one of the GitHub issues, the user’s Prisma schema attempted to drop many columns in auth.users (since they weren’t defined in his Prisma model)
medium.com
. Avoid this at all costs in production. If a Prisma migration accidentally runs on the auth schema, you might have to reinitialize auth (disabling/enabling auth as mentioned, or contacting support).
Maintain default auth schema structure: Don’t add extra columns to auth.users unless absolutely necessary. If you need custom user fields, use the raw_user_meta_data JSON column or your own profiles table. Adding columns might not break anything by itself, but note that Supabase could update the auth schema in the future – your custom column might get wiped or conflict during an upgrade. It’s safer to store additional user info in public.profiles (linked by FK as you have).
Constraints and foreign keys: When linking profiles (or any user-related table) to auth.users, always do it such that profiles.id references auth.users.id on delete cascade
supabase.com
. This way if a user is deleted via Supabase, the profile is cleaned up. Do not create a situation where inserting into auth.users demands a pre-existing row in profiles (which would be backwards). The flow should be: user inserted → trigger inserts profile. If you ever needed to enforce that every user has a profile, you could add a deferred constraint or use a join check, but the trigger essentially guarantees it.
RLS policy considerations: When writing RLS policies, remember that internal roles like service_role or supabase_auth_admin might need access. Typically, one common pattern is:
sql
Copy
create policy "Profiles are editable by owners" on public.profiles
  for all using ( auth.uid() = id ) with check ( auth.uid() = id );
This covers authenticated users. The service_role by default bypasses RLS only if you implement no policies at all. Once policies exist, service_role is treated like any other role unless you include it or mark policies as permissive. Often, developers just use auth.uid() which returns null for service_role (since it's not an authenticated user), effectively blocking it. If you plan to use the service key to read/write data, consider adding an OR condition for auth.role() = 'service_role' in relevant policies, or create separate policies TO service_role that allow full access. The same logic applies if you had some admin role – you might allow it explicitly in policies. In our case, the trigger is operating as an admin role at the SQL level, so by using security definer we sidestepped RLS. Just keep in mind RLS can block even privileged API calls if not accounted for.
Use Auth and Postgres logs during development: The Supabase dashboard’s log explorers are invaluable. Whenever you see a generic error in the UI or API, checking the logs will usually pinpoint the cause (be it a permission denied, or a violation of a constraint, etc.). In a development project, you can even turn on more verbose logging for debugging (though on Cloud the log level might be fixed).
By implementing the above plan, you should eliminate the "Database error checking email" and related errors. For example, after one user applied similar fixes (security definer trigger), they reported the trigger “works fine” and no longer blocks signups

. Supabase’s own docs affirm that these errors are resolved by addressing triggers or constraints issues

. Finally, as a quick checklist for future Supabase projects to avoid such problems:
✅ Use provided examples for auth triggers (security definer)
supabase.com
.
✅ Test user signup after any DB change related to auth.
✅ Avoid direct migrations on auth schema via ORMs – treat it as managed.
✅ Review auth logs on errors – they usually reveal the cause
supabase.com
.
✅ Keep auth-related extensions and roles intact – don’t drop or alter them beyond what docs recommend.
✅ Use foreign keys and RLS as recommended – e.g., on delete cascade on user FK
supabase.com
, and RLS policies using auth.uid() for user tables.
✅ If unsure, test in a dev project first – you can always create a free Supabase project to try a migration, and see if the Auth still works, before applying to another project.
By following these practices, you can prevent the majority of “mystery” auth errors and ensure a smooth authentication system in Supabase Cloud.

GitHub Issues: Various reports (#33278, #1061) of “Database error finding user” / “checking email” after schema resets – these align with either permissions being broken (especially by Prisma) or triggers causing side-effects. Supabase’s troubleshooting docs were updated to call out Prisma’s effect on auth table permissions

. In such cases, re-granting the proper privileges to the auth roles and/or re-running the auth migrations fixes the issue.
By implementing the solutions above and heeding the guidance from these sources, you should resolve the current auth error and fortify your Supabase project against similar problems going forward. Good luck, and happy coding with Supabase!
