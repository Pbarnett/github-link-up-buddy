- ✅ Build now succeeds without configuration errors

### 5. **Build System** - WORKING ✅
- ✅ **Application builds successfully** (`npm run build` ✅)
- ✅ **All core functionality preserved**
- ✅ Build completes in ~35-40 seconds

## 🟡 MINOR REMAINING ISSUES (Non-blocking)

### 1. **ESLint Warnings** - MANAGEABLE 🟡
```
- Hook dependency warnings (3-4 components)
- Remaining explicit `any` types in ProfileForm (4 instances) 
- React refresh warnings for anonymous components (minor)
```

### 2. **Build Performance Warnings** - OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITY 🟡
```
- Large chunk size warning (>500KB) - performance optimization
- Dynamic/static import mixing warning
- Chunk size: index-*.js (1.8MB minified, 485KB gzipped)
```

### 3. **Test Configuration** - NEEDS REVIEW 🟡
```
- Vitest projects configuration working but unit test project filter issue
- Tests are running but may need project selector refinement
```
