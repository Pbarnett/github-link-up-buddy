Root Fields
Starting up are the root options in the TSConfig - these options relate to how your TypeScript or JavaScript project is set up.
# Files - files
Specifies an allowlist of files to include in the program. An error occurs if any of the files can‚Äôt be found.
{
 "compilerOptions": {},
 "files": [
   "core.ts",
   "sys.ts",
   "types.ts",
   "scanner.ts",
   "parser.ts",
   "utilities.ts",
   "binder.ts",
   "checker.ts",
   "tsc.ts"
 ]
}
This is useful when you only have a small number of files and don‚Äôt need to use a glob to reference many files. If you need that then use include.
Default:
false

exclude

# Extends - extends
The value of extends is a string which contains a path to another configuration file to inherit from. The path may use Node.js style resolution.
The configuration from the base file are loaded first, then overridden by those in the inheriting config file. All relative paths found in the configuration file will be resolved relative to the configuration file they originated in.
It‚Äôs worth noting that files, include, and exclude from the inheriting config file overwrite those from the base config file, and that circularity between configuration files is not allowed.
Currently, the only top-level property that is excluded from inheritance is references.
Example
configs/base.json:
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "noImplicitAny": true,
   "strictNullChecks": true
 }
}
tsconfig.json:
{
 "extends": "./configs/base",
 "files": ["main.ts", "supplemental.ts"]
}
tsconfig.nostrictnull.json:
{
 "extends": "./tsconfig",
 "compilerOptions": {
   "strictNullChecks": false
 }
}
Properties with relative paths found in the configuration file, which aren‚Äôt excluded from inheritance, will be resolved relative to the configuration file they originated in.
Default:
false
Released:

# Include - include
Specifies an array of filenames or patterns to include in the program. These filenames are resolved relative to the directory containing the tsconfig.json file.
{
 "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*"]
}

include and exclude support wildcard characters to make glob patterns:
* matches zero or more characters (excluding directory separators)
? matches any one character (excluding directory separators)
**/ matches any directory nested to any level
If the last path segment in a pattern does not contain a file extension or wildcard character, then it is treated as a directory, and files with supported extensions inside that directory are included (e.g. .ts, .tsx, and .d.ts by default, with .js and .jsx if allowJs is set to true).
Default:
[] if files is specified; **/* otherwise.

exclude
Released:
2.0
# Exclude - exclude
Specifies an array of filenames or patterns that should be skipped when resolving include.
Important: exclude only changes which files are included as a result of the include setting. A file specified by exclude can still become part of your codebase due to an import statement in your code, a types inclusion, a /// <reference directive, or being specified in the files list.
It is not a mechanism that prevents a file from being included in the codebase - it simply changes what the include setting finds.

# References - references
Project references are a way to structure your TypeScript programs into smaller pieces. Using Project References can greatly improve build and editor interaction times, enforce logical separation between components, and organize your code in new and improved ways.

#Type Checking
# Allow Unreachable Code - allowUnreachableCode
When:
undefined (default) provide suggestions as warnings to editors
true unreachable code is ignored
false raises compiler errors about unreachable code
These warnings are only about code which is provably unreachable due to the use of JavaScript syntax, for example:
function fn(n: number) {
 if (n > 5) {
   return true;
 } else {
   return false;
 }
 return true;
}
With "allowUnreachableCode": false:
function fn(n: number) {
 if (n > 5) {
   return true;
 } else {
   return false;
 }
 return true;
Unreachable code detected.
}
Try
This does not affect errors on the basis of code which appears to be unreachable due to type analysis.
Released:
1.8
# Allow Unused Labels - allowUnusedLabels
When:
undefined (default) provide suggestions as warnings to editors
true unused labels are ignored
false raises compiler errors about unused labels
Labels are very rare in JavaScript and typically indicate an attempt to write an object literal:
function verifyAge(age: number) {
 // Forgot 'return' statement
 if (age > 18) {
   verified: true;
Unused label.
 }
}
Try
Released:
1.8
# Always Strict - alwaysStrict
Ensures that your files are parsed in the ECMAScript strict mode, and emit ‚Äúuse strict‚Äù for each source file.
ECMAScript strict mode was introduced in ES5 and provides behavior tweaks to the runtime of the JavaScript engine to improve performance, and makes a set of errors throw instead of silently ignoring them.
Recommended
Default:
true if strict; false otherwise.
Related:
strict
Released:
2.1
# Exact Optional Property Types - exactOptionalPropertyTypes
With exactOptionalPropertyTypes enabled, TypeScript applies stricter rules around how it handles properties on type or interfaces which have a ? prefix.
For example, this interface declares that there is a property which can be one of two strings: ‚Äòdark‚Äô or ‚Äòlight‚Äô or it should not be in the object.
interface UserDefaults {
 // The absence of a value represents 'system'
 colorThemeOverride?: "dark" | "light";
}
Without this flag enabled, there are three values which you can set colorThemeOverride to be: ‚Äúdark‚Äù, ‚Äúlight‚Äù and undefined.
Setting the value to undefined will allow most JavaScript runtime checks for the existence to fail, which is effectively falsy. However, this isn‚Äôt quite accurate; colorThemeOverride: undefined is not the same as colorThemeOverride not being defined. For example, "colorThemeOverride" in settings would have different behavior with undefined as the key compared to not being defined.
exactOptionalPropertyTypes makes TypeScript truly enforce the definition provided as an optional property:
const settings = getUserSettings();
settings.colorThemeOverride = "dark";
settings.colorThemeOverride = "light";
 
// But not:
settings.colorThemeOverride = undefined;
Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type '"dark" | "light"' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true'. Consider adding 'undefined' to the type of the target.
Try
Recommended
Released:
4.4
# No Fallthrough Cases In Switch - noFallthroughCasesInSwitch
Report errors for fallthrough cases in switch statements. Ensures that any non-empty case inside a switch statement includes either break, return, or throw. This means you won‚Äôt accidentally ship a case fallthrough bug.
const a: number = 6;
 
switch (a) {
 case 0:
Fallthrough case in switch.
   console.log("even");
 case 1:
   console.log("odd");
   break;
}
Try
Released:
1.8
# No Implicit Any - noImplicitAny
In some cases where no type annotations are present, TypeScript will fall back to a type of any for a variable when it cannot infer the type.
This can cause some errors to be missed, for example:
function fn(s) {
 // No error?
 console.log(s.subtr(3));
}
fn(42);
Try
Turning on noImplicitAny however TypeScript will issue an error whenever it would have inferred any:
function fn(s) {
Parameter 's' implicitly has an 'any' type.
 console.log(s.subtr(3));
}
Try
Recommended
Default:
true if strict; false otherwise.

1.0
# No Implicit Override - noImplicitOverride
When working with classes which use inheritance, it‚Äôs possible for a sub-class to get ‚Äúout of sync‚Äù with the functions it overloads when they are renamed in the base class.
For example, imagine you are modeling a music album syncing system:
class Album {
 download() {
   // Default behavior
 }
}
 
class SharedAlbum extends Album {
 download() {
   // Override to get info from many sources
 }
}
Try
Then when you add support for machine-learning generated playlists, you refactor the Album class to have a ‚Äòsetup‚Äô function instead:
class Album {
 setup() {
   // Default behavior
 }
}
 
class MLAlbum extends Album {
 setup() {
   // Override to get info from algorithm
 }
}
 
class SharedAlbum extends Album {
 download() {
   // Override to get info from many sources
 }
}
Try
In this case, TypeScript has provided no warning that download on SharedAlbum expected to override a function in the base class.
Using noImplicitOverride you can ensure that the sub-classes never go out of sync, by ensuring that functions which override include the keyword override.
The following example has noImplicitOverride enabled, and you can see the error received when override is missing:
class Album {
 setup() {}
}
 
class MLAlbum extends Album {
 override setup() {}
}
 
class SharedAlbum extends Album {
 setup() {}
This member must have an 'override' modifier because it overrides a member in the base class 'Album'.
}
Try
Released:
4.3
# No Implicit Returns - noImplicitReturns
When enabled, TypeScript will check all code paths in a function to ensure they return a value.
function lookupHeadphonesManufacturer(color: "blue" | "black"): string {
Function lacks ending return statement and return type does not include 'undefined'.
 if (color === "blue") {
   return "beats";
 } else {
   ("bose");
 }
}
Try
Released:
1.8
# No Implicit This - noImplicitThis
Raise error on ‚Äòthis‚Äô expressions with an implied ‚Äòany‚Äô type.
For example, the class below returns a function which tries to access this.width and this.height ‚Äì but the context for this inside the function inside getAreaFunction is not the instance of the Rectangle.
class Rectangle {
 width: number;
 height: number;
 
 constructor(width: number, height: number) {
   this.width = width;
   this.height = height;
 }
 
 getAreaFunction() {
   return function () {
     return this.width * this.height;
'this' implicitly has type 'any' because it does not have a type annotation.
'this' implicitly has type 'any' because it does not have a type annotation.

# No Property Access From Index Signature - noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature
This setting ensures consistency between accessing a field via the ‚Äúdot‚Äù (obj.key) syntax, and ‚Äúindexed‚Äù (obj["key"]) and the way which the property is declared in the type.
Without this flag, TypeScript will allow you to use the dot syntax to access fields which are not defined:
interface GameSettings {
 // Known up-front properties
 speed: "fast" | "medium" | "slow";
 quality: "high" | "low";
 
 // Assume anything unknown to the interface
 // is a string.
 [key: string]: string;
}
 
const settings = getSettings();
settings.speed;
        
(property) GameSettings.speed: "fast" | "medium" | "slow"
settings.quality;
         
(property) GameSettings.quality: "high" | "low"
 
// Unknown key accessors are allowed on
// this object, and are `string`
settings.username;
          
(index) GameSettings[string]: string
Try
Turning the flag on will raise an error because the unknown field uses dot syntax instead of indexed syntax.
const settings = getSettings();
settings.speed;
settings.quality;
 
// This would need to be settings["username"];
settings.username;
Property 'username' comes from an index signature, so it must be accessed with ['username'].
          
(index) GameSettings[string]: string
Try
The goal of this flag is to signal intent in your calling syntax about how certain you are this property exists.
Released:
4.2
# No Unchecked Indexed Access - noUncheckedIndexedAccess
TypeScript has a way to describe objects which have unknown keys but known values on an object, via index signatures.
interface EnvironmentVars {
 NAME: string;
 OS: string;
 
 // Unknown properties are covered by this index signature.
 [propName: string]: string;
}
 
declare const env: EnvironmentVars;
 
// Declared as existing
const sysName = env.NAME;
const os = env.OS;
    
const os: string
 
// Not declared, but because of the index
// signature, then it is considered a string
const nodeEnv = env.NODE_ENV;
      
const nodeEnv: string
Try
Turning on noUncheckedIndexedAccess will add undefined to any un-declared field in the type.
declare const env: EnvironmentVars;
 
// Declared as existing
const sysName = env.NAME;
const os = env.OS;
    
const os: string
 
// Not declared, but because of the index
// signature, then it is considered a string

# Strict - strict
The strict flag enables a wide range of type checking behavior that results in stronger guarantees of program correctness. Turning this on is equivalent to enabling all of the strict mode family options, which are outlined below. You can then turn off individual strict mode family checks as needed.
Future versions of TypeScript may introduce additional stricter checking under this flag, so upgrades of TypeScript might result in new type errors in your program. When appropriate and possible, a corresponding flag will be added to disable that behavior.

# Strict Bind Call Apply - strictBindCallApply
When set, TypeScript will check that the built-in methods of functions call, bind, and apply are invoked with correct argument for the underlying function:
// With strictBindCallApply on
function fn(x: string) {
 return parseInt(x);
}
 
const n1 = fn.call(undefined, "10");
 
const n2 = fn.call(undefined, false);
Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
Try
Otherwise, these functions accept any arguments and will return any:
// With strictBindCallApply off
function fn(x: string) {
 return parseInt(x);
}

# Strict Function Types - strictFunctionTypes
When enabled, this flag causes functions parameters to be checked more correctly.
Here‚Äôs a basic example with strictFunctionTypes off:
function fn(x: string) {
 console.log("Hello, " + x.toLowerCase());
}
 
type StringOrNumberFunc = (ns: string | number) => void;
 
// Unsafe assignment
let func: StringOrNumberFunc = fn;
// Unsafe call - will crash
func(10);
Try
With strictFunctionTypes on, the error is correctly detected:
function fn(x: string) {
 console.log("Hello, " + x.toLowerCase());
}
 
type StringOrNumberFunc = (ns: string | number) => void;
 
// Unsafe assignment is prevented
let func: StringOrNumberFunc = fn;
Type '(x: string) => void' is not assignable to type 'StringOrNumberFunc'.
  Types of parameters 'x' and 'ns' are incompatible.
    Type 'string | number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
      Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
Try
During development of this feature, we discovered a large number of inherently unsafe class hierarchies, including some in the DOM. Because of this, the setting only applies to functions written in function syntax, not to those in method syntax:
type Methodish = {
 func(x: string | number): void;
};
 
function fn(x: string) {
 console.log("Hello, " + x.toLowerCase());
}
 
// Ultimately an unsafe assignment, but not detected
const m: Methodish = {
 func: fn,
};
m.func(10);

# Strict Null Checks - strictNullChecks
When strictNullChecks is false, null and undefined are effectively ignored by the language. This can lead to unexpected errors at runtime.
When strictNullChecks is true, null and undefined have their own distinct types and you‚Äôll get a type error if you try to use them where a concrete value is expected.
For example with this TypeScript code, users.find has no guarantee that it will actually find a user, but you can write code as though it will:
declare const loggedInUsername: string;
 
const users = [
 { name: "Oby", age: 12 },
 { name: "Heera", age: 32 },
];
 
const loggedInUser = users.find((u) => u.name === loggedInUsername);
console.log(loggedInUser.age);
Try
Setting strictNullChecks to true will raise an error that you have not made a guarantee that the loggedInUser exists before trying to use it.
declare const loggedInUsername: string;
 
const users = [
 { name: "Oby", age: 12 },
 { name: "Heera", age: 32 },
];

'loggedInUser' is possibly 'undefined'.

The second example failed because the array‚Äôs find function looks a bit like this simplification:
// When strictNullChecks: true
type Array = {
 find(predicate: (value: any, index: number) => boolean): S | undefined;
};
// When strictNullChecks: false the undefined is removed from the type system,
// allowing you to write code which assumes it always found a result
type Array = {
 find(predicate: (value: any, index: number) => boolean): S;
};

# Strict Property Initialization - strictPropertyInitialization
When set to true, TypeScript will raise an error when a class property was declared but not set in the constructor.
class UserAccount {
 name: string;
 accountType = "user";
 
 email: string;
Property 'email' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.
 address: string | undefined;
 
 constructor(name: string) {
   this.name = name;
   // Note that this.email is not set
 }
}
Try
In the above case:
this.name is set specifically.
this.accountType is set by default.
this.email is not set and raises an error.
this.address is declared as potentially undefined which means it does not have to be set.

# Use Unknown In Catch Variables - useUnknownInCatchVariables
In TypeScript 4.0, support was added to allow changing the type of the variable in a catch clause from any to unknown. Allowing for code like:
try {
 // ...
} catch (err: unknown) {
 // We have to verify err is an
 // error before using it as one.
 if (err instanceof Error) {
   console.log(err.message);
 }
}
Try
This pattern ensures that error handling code becomes more comprehensive because you cannot guarantee that the object being thrown is a Error subclass ahead of time. With the flag useUnknownInCatchVariables enabled, then you do not need the additional syntax (: unknown) nor a linter rule to try enforce this behavior.
Recommended

# Allow Arbitrary Extensions - allowArbitraryExtensions
In TypeScript 5.0, when an import path ends in an extension that isn‚Äôt a known JavaScript or TypeScript file extension, the compiler will look for a declaration file for that path in the form of {file basename}.d.{extension}.ts. For example, if you are using a CSS loader in a bundler project, you might want to write (or generate) declaration files for those stylesheets:
/* app.css */
.cookie-banner {
 display: none;
}
// app.d.css.ts
declare const css: {
 cookieBanner: string;
};
export default css;
// App.tsx
import styles from "./app.css";
styles.cookieBanner; // string
By default, this import will raise an error to let you know that TypeScript doesn‚Äôt understand this file type and your runtime might not support importing it. But if you‚Äôve configured your runtime or bundler to handle it, you can suppress the error with the new --allowArbitraryExtensions compiler option.
Note that historically, a similar effect has often been achievable by adding a declaration file named app.css.d.ts instead of app.d.css.ts - however, this just worked through Node‚Äôs require resolution rules for CommonJS. Strictly speaking, the former is interpreted as a declaration file for a JavaScript file named app.css.js. Because relative files imports need to include extensions in Node‚Äôs ESM support, TypeScript would error on our example in an ESM file under --moduleResolution node16 or nodenext.
For more information, read up the proposal for this feature and its corresponding pull request.

# Allow Importing TS Extensions - allowImportingTsExtensions
--allowImportingTsExtensions allows TypeScript files to import each other with a TypeScript-specific extension like .ts, .mts, or .tsx.
This flag is only allowed when --noEmit or --emitDeclarationOnly is enabled, since these import paths would not be resolvable at runtime in JavaScript output files. The expectation here is that your resolver (e.g. your bundler, a runtime, or some other tool) is going to make these imports between .ts files work.
Default:
true if rewriteRelativeImportExtensions; false otherwise.

# Allow Umd Global Access - allowUmdGlobalAccess
When set to true, allowUmdGlobalAccess lets you access UMD exports as globals from inside module files. A module file is a file that has imports and/or exports. Without this flag, using an export from a UMD module requires an import declaration.
An example use case for this flag would be a web project where you know the particular library (like jQuery or Lodash) will always be available at runtime, but you can‚Äôt access it with an import.
Released:

# Base URL - baseUrl
Sets a base directory from which to resolve bare specifier module names. For example, in the directory structure:
project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ex.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hello
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ world.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
With "baseUrl": "./", TypeScript will look for files starting at the same folder as the tsconfig.json:
import { helloWorld } from "hello/world";
console.log(helloWorld);
This resolution has higher priority than lookups from node_modules.
This feature was designed for use in conjunction with AMD module loaders in the browser, and is not recommended in any other context. As of TypeScript 4.1, baseUrl is no longer required to be set when using paths.
Released:
2.0
# Custom Conditions - customConditions
--customConditions takes a list of additional conditions that should succeed when TypeScript resolves from an exports or imports field of a package.json. These conditions are added to whatever existing conditions a resolver will use by default.
For example, when this field is set in a tsconfig.json as so:
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "target": "es2022",
   "moduleResolution": "bundler",
   "customConditions": ["my-condition"]
 }
}
Any time an exports or imports field is referenced in package.json, TypeScript will consider conditions called my-condition.
So when importing from a package with the following package.json
{
 // ...
 "exports": {
   ".": {
     "my-condition": "./foo.mjs",
     "node": "./bar.mjs",
     "import": "./baz.mjs",
     "require": "./biz.mjs"
   }
 }
}
TypeScript will try to look for files corresponding to foo.mjs.
This field is only valid under the node16, nodenext, and bundler options for --moduleResolution.

# Module - module
Sets the module system for the program. See the theory behind TypeScript‚Äôs module option and its reference page for more information. You very likely want "nodenext" for modern Node.js projects and preserve or esnext for code that will be bundled.
Changing module affects moduleResolution which also has a reference page.
Here‚Äôs some example output for this file:
// @filename: index.ts
import { valueOfPi } from "./constants";
 
export const twoPi = valueOfPi * 2;
Try
CommonJS
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports.twoPi = void 0;
const constants_1 = require("./constants");
exports.twoPi = constants_1.valueOfPi * 2;

       execute: function () {
           exports_1("twoPi", twoPi = constants_1.valueOfPi * 2);
       }
   };

Try
In addition to the base functionality of ES2015/ES6, ES2020 adds support for dynamic imports, and import.meta while ES2022 further adds support for top level await.
node16/node18/nodenext
The node16, node18, and nodenext modes integrate with Node‚Äôs native ECMAScript Module support. The emitted JavaScript uses either CommonJS or ES2020 output depending on the file extension and the value of the type setting in the nearest package.json. Module resolution also works differently. You can learn more in the handbook and Modules Reference.
node16 is available from TypeScript 4.7
node18 is available from TypeScript 5.8 as a replacement for node16, with added support for import attributes.
nodenext is available from TypeScript 4.7, but its behavior changes with the latest stable versions of Node.js. As of TypeScript 5.8, nodenext supports require of ECMAScript modules.
preserve
In --module preserve (added in TypeScript 5.4), ECMAScript imports and exports written in input files are preserved in the output, and CommonJS-style import x = require("...") and export = ... statements are emitted as CommonJS require and module.exports. In other words, the format of each individual import or export statement is preserved, rather than being coerced into a single format for the whole compilation (or even a whole file).
import { valueOfPi } from "./constants";
const constants = require("./constants");
export const piSquared = valueOfPi * constants.valueOfPi;
 
Try
While it‚Äôs rare to need to mix imports and require calls in the same file, this module mode best reflects the capabilities of most modern bundlers, as well as the Bun runtime.
Why care about TypeScript‚Äôs module emit with a bundler or with Bun, where you‚Äôre likely also setting noEmit? TypeScript‚Äôs type checking and module resolution behavior are affected by the module format that it would emit. Setting module gives TypeScript information about how your bundler or runtime will process imports and exports, which ensures that the types you see on imported values accurately reflect what will happen at runtime or after bundling.

# Module Resolution - moduleResolution
Specify the module resolution strategy:
'node16' or 'nodenext' for modern versions of Node.js. Node.js v12 and later supports both ECMAScript imports and CommonJS require, which resolve using different algorithms. These moduleResolution values, when combined with the corresponding module values, picks the right algorithm for each resolution based on whether Node.js will see an import or require in the output JavaScript code.
'node10' (previously called 'node') for Node.js versions older than v10, which only support CommonJS require. You probably won‚Äôt need to use node10 in modern code.
'bundler' for use with bundlers. Like node16 and nodenext, this mode supports package.json "imports" and "exports", but unlike the Node.js resolution modes, bundler never requires file extensions on relative paths in imports.
'classic' was used in TypeScript before the release of 1.6. classic should not be used.
There are reference pages explaining the theory behind TypeScript‚Äôs module resolution and the details of each option.
Default:
Node10 if module is CommonJS; Node16 if module is Node16 or Node18; NodeNext if module is NodeNext; Bundler if module is Preserve; Classic otherwise.

# Module Suffixes - moduleSuffixes
Provides a way to override the default list of file name suffixes to search when resolving a module.
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "moduleSuffixes": [".ios", ".native", ""]
 }
}
Given the above configuration, an import like the following:
import * as foo from "./foo";
TypeScript will look for the relative files ./foo.ios.ts, ./foo.native.ts, and finally ./foo.ts.
Note the empty string "" in moduleSuffixes which is necessary for TypeScript to also look-up ./foo.ts.
This feature can be useful for React Native projects where each target platform can use a separate tsconfig.json with differing moduleSuffixes.
Released:
4.7
# No Resolve - noResolve
By default, TypeScript will examine the initial set of files for import and <reference directives and add these resolved files to your program.
If noResolve is set, this process doesn‚Äôt happen. However, import statements are still checked to see if they resolve to a valid module, so you‚Äôll need to make sure this is satisfied by some other means.
Released:
1.0
# noUncheckedSideEffectImports - noUncheckedSideEffectImports
In JavaScript it‚Äôs possible to import a module without actually importing any values from it.
import "some-module";
These imports are often called side effect imports because the only useful behavior they can provide is by executing some side effect (like registering a global variable, or adding a polyfill to a prototype).
By default, TypeScript will not check these imports for validity. If the import resolves to a valid source file, TypeScript will load and check the file. If no source file is found, TypeScript will silently ignore the import.
This is surprising behavior, but it partially stems from modeling patterns in the JavaScript ecosystem. For example, this syntax has also been used with special loaders in bundlers to load CSS or other assets. Your bundler might be configured in such a way where you can include specific .css files by writing something like the following:
import "./button-component.css";
export function Button() {
 // ...
}
Still, this masks potential typos on side effect imports.
When --noUncheckedSideEffectImports is enabled, TypeScript will error if it can‚Äôt find a source file for a side effect import.
import "oops-this-module-does-not-exist";
//     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// error: Cannot find module 'oops-this-module-does-not-exist' or its corresponding
//        type declarations.
When enabling this option, some working code may now receive an error, like in the CSS example above. To work around this, users who want to just write side effect imports for assets might be better served by writing what‚Äôs called an ambient module declaration with a wildcard specifier. It would go in a global file and look something like the following:
// ./src/globals.d.ts
// Recognize all CSS files as module imports.
declare module "*.css" {}
In fact, you might already have a file like this in your project! For example, running something like vite init might create a similar vite-env.d.ts.
Released:
5.6
# Paths - paths
A series of entries which re-map imports to lookup locations relative to the baseUrl if set, or to the tsconfig file itself otherwise. There is a larger coverage of paths in the moduleResolution reference page.
paths lets you declare how TypeScript should resolve an import in your require/imports.
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "paths": {
     "jquery": ["./vendor/jquery/dist/jquery"]
   }
 }
}
This would allow you to be able to write import "jquery", and get all of the correct typing locally.
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "paths": {
     "app/*": ["./src/app/*"],
     "config/*": ["./src/app/_config/*"],
     "environment/*": ["./src/environments/*"],
     "shared/*": ["./src/app/_shared/*"],
     "helpers/*": ["./src/helpers/*"],
     "tests/*": ["./src/tests/*"]
   }
 }
}
In this case, you can tell the TypeScript file resolver to support a number of custom prefixes to find code.
Note that this feature does not change how import paths are emitted by tsc, so paths should only be used to inform TypeScript that another tool has this mapping and will use it at runtime or when bundling.

# Resolve JSON Module - resolveJsonModule
Allows importing modules with a .json extension, which is a common practice in node projects. This includes generating a type for the import based on the static JSON shape.
TypeScript does not support resolving JSON files by default:
// @filename: settings.json
{
   "repo": "TypeScript",
   "dry": false,
   "debug": false
}
// @filename: index.ts
import settings from "./settings.json";
Cannot find module './settings.json'. Consider using '--resolveJsonModule' to import module with '.json' extension.
 
settings.debug === true;
settings.dry === 2;
Try
Enabling the option allows importing JSON, and validating the types in that JSON file.
// @filename: settings.json
{
   "repo": "TypeScript",
   "dry": false,
   "debug": false
}
// @filename: index.ts
import settings from "./settings.json";
 
settings.debug === true;

# Root Dir - rootDir
Default: The longest common path of all non-declaration input files. If composite is set, the default is instead the directory containing the tsconfig.json file.
When TypeScript compiles files, it keeps the same directory structure in the output directory as exists in the input directory.
For example, let‚Äôs say you have some input files:
MyProj
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ a.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ b.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ c.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.d.ts
The inferred value for rootDir is the longest common path of all non-declaration input files, which in this case is core/.
If your outDir was dist, TypeScript would write this tree:
MyProj
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ a.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ b.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ c.js
However, you may have intended for core to be part of the output directory structure. By setting rootDir: "." in tsconfig.json, TypeScript would write this tree:
MyProj
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ a.js
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ b.js
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ c.js
Importantly, rootDir does not affect which files become part of the compilation. It has no interaction with the include, exclude, or files tsconfig.json settings.
Note that TypeScript will never write an output file to a directory outside of outDir, and will never skip emitting a file. For this reason, rootDir also enforces that all files which need to be emitted are underneath the rootDir path.
For example, let‚Äôs say you had this tree:
MyProj
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ a.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ b.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helpers.ts
It would be an error to specify rootDir as core and include as * because it creates a file (helpers.ts) that would need to be emitted outside the outDir (i.e. ../helpers.js).
Default:
Computed from the list of input files.
Released:

# Root Dirs - rootDirs
Using rootDirs, you can inform the compiler that there are many ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù directories acting as a single root. This allows the compiler to resolve relative module imports within these ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù directories, as if they were merged in to one directory.
For example:
src
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ views
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ view1.ts (can import "./template1", "./view2`)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ view2.ts (can import "./template1", "./view1`)
generated
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ views
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ template1.ts (can import "./view1", "./view2")
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "rootDirs": ["src/views", "generated/templates/views"]
 }
}
This does not affect how TypeScript emits JavaScript, it only emulates the assumption that they will be able to work via those relative paths at runtime.
rootDirs can be used to provide a separate ‚Äútype layer‚Äù to files that are not TypeScript or JavaScript by providing a home for generated .d.ts files in another folder. This technique is useful for bundled applications where you use import of files that aren‚Äôt necessarily code:
src
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ css
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.css
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ navigation.css
generated
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ css
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.css.d.ts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ navigation.css.d.ts
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "rootDirs": ["src", "generated"]
 }
}
This technique lets you generate types ahead of time for the non-code source files. Imports then work naturally based off the source file‚Äôs location. For example ./src/index.ts can import the file ./src/css/main.css and TypeScript will be aware of the bundler‚Äôs behavior for that filetype via the corresponding generated declaration file.
// @filename: index.ts
import { appClass } from "./main.css";
Try
Default:
Computed from the list of input files.

# Type Roots - typeRoots
By default all visible ‚Äù@types‚Äù packages are included in your compilation. Packages in node_modules/@types of any enclosing folder are considered visible. For example, that means packages within ./node_modules/@types/, ../node_modules/@types/, ../../node_modules/@types/, and so on.
If typeRoots is specified, only packages under typeRoots will be included. For example:
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "typeRoots": ["./typings", "./vendor/types"]

# Types - types

If types is specified, only packages listed will be included in the global scope. For instance:
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "types": ["node", "jest", "express"]
 }
}
This tsconfig.json file will only include ./node_modules/@types/node, ./node_modules/@types/jest and ./node_modules/@types/express. Other packages under node_modules/@types/* will not be included.
What does this affect?
This option does not affect how @types/* are included in your application code, for example if you had the above compilerOptions example with code like:
import * as moment from "moment";
moment().format("MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a");
The moment import would be fully typed.
When you have this option set, by not including a module in the types array it:
Will not add globals to your project (e.g process in node, or expect in Jest)
Will not have exports appear as auto-import recommendations
This feature differs from typeRoots in that it is about specifying only the exact types you want included, whereas typeRoots supports saying you want particular folders.

#Emit
# Declaration - declaration
Generate .d.ts files for every TypeScript or JavaScript file inside your project. These .d.ts files are type definition files which describe the external API of your module. With .d.ts files, tools like TypeScript can provide intellisense and accurate types for un-typed code.
When declaration is set to true, running the compiler with this TypeScript code:

# Downlevel Iteration - downlevelIteration
Downleveling is TypeScript‚Äôs term for transpiling to an older version of JavaScript. This flag is to enable support for a more accurate implementation of how modern JavaScript iterates through new concepts in older JavaScript runtimes.
ECMAScript 6 added several new iteration primitives: the for / of loop (for (el of arr)), Array spread ([a, ...b]), argument spread (fn(...args)), and Symbol.iterator. downlevelIteration allows for these iteration primitives to be used more accurately in ES5 environments if a Symbol.iterator implementation is present.
Example: Effects on for / of
With this TypeScript code:
const str = "Hello!";
for (const s of str) {
 console.log(s);
}
Try
Without downlevelIteration enabled, a for / of loop on any object is downleveled to a traditional for loop:

This is often what people expect, but it‚Äôs not 100% compliant with ECMAScript iteration protocol. Certain strings, such as emoji (üòú), have a .length of 2 (or even more!), but should iterate as 1 unit in a for-of loop. See this blog post by Jonathan New for a longer explanation.
When downlevelIteration is enabled, TypeScript will use a helper function that checks for a Symbol.iterator implementation (either native or polyfill). If this implementation is missing, you‚Äôll fall back to index-based iteration.
"use strict";
var __values = (this && this.__values) || function(o) {
   var s = typeof Symbol === "function" && Symbol.iterator, m = s && o[s], i = 0;
   if (m) return m.call(o);
   if (o && typeof o.length === "number") return {
       next: function () {
           if (o && i >= o.length) o = void 0;
           return { value: o && o[i++], done: !o };
       }
   };
   throw new TypeError(s ? "Object is not iterable." : "Symbol.iterator is not defined.");
};
var e_1, _a;
var str = "Hello!";
try {
   for (var str_1 = __values(str), str_1_1 = str_1.next(); !str_1_1.done; str_1_1 = str_1.next()) {
       var s = str_1_1.value;
       console.log(s);
   }
}
catch (e_1_1) { e_1 = { error: e_1_1 }; }
finally {
   try {
       if (str_1_1 && !str_1_1.done && (_a = str_1.return)) _a.call(str_1);
   }
   finally { if (e_1) throw e_1.error; }
}
 
Try
You can use tslib via importHelpers to reduce the amount of inline JavaScript too:
"use strict";
var __values = (this && this.__values) || function(o) {
   var s = typeof Symbol === "function" && Symbol.iterator, m = s && o[s], i = 0;
   if (m) return m.call(o);
   if (o && typeof o.length === "number") return {
       next: function () {
           if (o && i >= o.length) o = void 0;
           return { value: o && o[i++], done: !o };
       }
   };
   throw new TypeError(s ? "Object is not iterable." : "Symbol.iterator is not defined.");
};
var e_1, _a;
var str = "Hello!";
try {
   for (var str_1 = __values(str), str_1_1 = str_1.next(); !str_1_1.done; str_1_1 = str_1.next()) {
       var s = str_1_1.value;
       console.log(s);
   }
}
catch (e_1_1) { e_1 = { error: e_1_1 }; }
finally {
   try {
       if (str_1_1 && !str_1_1.done && (_a = str_1.return)) _a.call(str_1);
   }
   finally { if (e_1) throw e_1.error; }
}
 
Try
Note: enabling downlevelIteration does not improve compliance if Symbol.iterator is not present in the runtime.
Example: Effects on Array Spreads
This is an array spread:
// Make a new array whose elements are 1 followed by the elements of arr2
const arr = [1, ...arr2];
Based on the description, it sounds easy to downlevel to ES5:
// The same, right?
const arr = [1].concat(arr2);
However, this is observably different in certain rare cases.
For example, if a source array is missing one or more items (contains a hole), the spread syntax will replace each empty item with undefined, whereas .concat will leave them intact.
// Make an array where the element at index 1 is missing
let arrayWithHole = ["a", , "c"];
let spread = [...arrayWithHole];
let concatenated = [].concat(arrayWithHole);
console.log(arrayWithHole);
// [ 'a', <1 empty item>, 'c' ]
console.log(spread);
// [ 'a', undefined, 'c' ]
console.log(concatenated);
// [ 'a', <1 empty item>, 'c' ]
Just as with for / of, downlevelIteration will use Symbol.iterator (if present) to more accurately emulate ES 6 behavior.

# Import Helpers - importHelpers
For certain downleveling operations, TypeScript uses some helper code for operations like extending class, spreading arrays or objects, and async operations. By default, these helpers are inserted into files which use them. This can result in code duplication if the same helper is used in many different modules.
If the importHelpers flag is on, these helper functions are instead imported from the tslib module. You will need to ensure that the tslib module is able to be imported at runtime. This only affects modules; global script files will not attempt to import modules.
For example, with this TypeScript:
export function fn(arr: number[]) {
 const arr2 = [1, ...arr];
}
Turning on downlevelIteration and importHelpers is still false:
var __read = (this && this.__read) || function (o, n) {
   var m = typeof Symbol === "function" && o[Symbol.iterator];
   if (!m) return o;
   var i = m.call(o), r, ar = [], e;
   try {
       while ((n === void 0 || n-- > 0) && !(r = i.next()).done) ar.push(r.value);
   }
   catch (error) { e = { error: error }; }
   finally {
       try {
           if (r && !r.done && (m = i["return"])) m.call(i);
       }
       finally { if (e) throw e.error; }
   }
   return ar;
};
var __spreadArray = (this && this.__spreadArray) || function (to, from, pack) {
   if (pack || arguments.length === 2) for (var i = 0, l = from.length, ar; i < l; i++) {
       if (ar || !(i in from)) {
           if (!ar) ar = Array.prototype.slice.call(from, 0, i);
           ar[i] = from[i];
       }
   }
   return to.concat(ar || Array.prototype.slice.call(from));
};
export function fn(arr) {
   var arr2 = __spreadArray([1], __read(arr), false);
}
 
Try
Then turning on both downlevelIteration and importHelpers:
import { __read, __spreadArray } from "tslib";
export function fn(arr) {
   var arr2 = __spreadArray([1], __read(arr), false);
}
 
Try
You can use noEmitHelpers when you provide your own implementations of these functions.

# Inline Source Map - inlineSourceMap
When set, instead of writing out a .js.map file to provide source maps, TypeScript will embed the source map content in the .js files. Although this results in larger JS files, it can be convenient in some scenarios. For example, you might want to debug JS files on a webserver that doesn‚Äôt allow .map files to be served.
Mutually exclusive with sourceMap.
For example, with this TypeScript:
const helloWorld = "hi";
console.log(helloWorld);
Converts to this JavaScript:
"use strict";
const helloWorld = "hi";
console.log(helloWorld);
 
Try
Then enable building it with inlineSourceMap enabled there is a comment at the bottom of the file which includes a source-map for the file.
"use strict";
const helloWorld = "hi";
console.log(helloWorld);

# Inline Sources - inlineSources
When set, TypeScript will include the original content of the .ts file as an embedded string in the source map (using the source map‚Äôs sourcesContent property). This is often useful in the same cases as inlineSourceMap.
Requires either sourceMap or inlineSourceMap to be set.
For example, with this TypeScript:
const helloWorld = "hi";
console.log(helloWorld);
Try
By default converts to this JavaScript:
"use strict";
const helloWorld = "hi";
console.log(helloWorld);
 
Try
Then enable building it with inlineSources and inlineSourceMap enabled there is a comment at the bottom of the file which includes a source-map for the file. Note that the end is different from the example in inlineSourceMap because the source-map now contains the original source code also.
"use strict";
const helloWorld = "hi";
console.log(helloWorld);

# No Emit - noEmit
Do not emit compiler output files like JavaScript source code, source-maps or declarations.

# No Emit Helpers - noEmitHelpers
Instead of importing helpers with importHelpers, you can provide implementations in the global scope for the helpers you use and completely turn off emitting of helper functions.
For example, using this async function in ES5 requires a await-like function and generator-like function to run:
const getAPI = async (url: string) => {
 // Get API
 return {};
};

# No Emit On Error - noEmitOnError
Do not emit compiler output files like JavaScript source code, source-maps or declarations if any errors were reported.

# Out Dir - outDir
If specified, .js (as well as .d.ts, .js.map, etc.) files will be emitted into this directory. The directory structure of the original source files is preserved; see rootDir if the computed root is not what you intended.
If not specified, .js files will be emitted in the same directory as the .ts files they were generated from:

# Preserve Const Enums - preserveConstEnums
Do not erase const enum declarations in generated code. const enums provide a way to reduce the overall memory footprint of your application at runtime by emitting the enum value instead of a reference.
For example with this TypeScript:
const enum Album {
 JimmyEatWorldFutures = 1,
 TubRingZooHypothesis = 2,
 DogFashionDiscoAdultery = 3,
}
 
const selectedAlbum = Album.JimmyEatWorldFutures;
if (selectedAlbum === Album.JimmyEatWorldFutures) {
 console.log("That is a great choice.");
}
Try
The default const enum behavior is to convert any Album.Something to the corresponding number literal, and to remove a reference to the enum from the JavaScript completely.
"use strict";
const selectedAlbum = 1 /* Album.JimmyEatWorldFutures */;
if (selectedAlbum === 1 /* Album.JimmyEatWorldFutures */) {
   console.log("That is a great choice.");
}
 
Try
With preserveConstEnums set to true, the enum exists at runtime and the numbers are still emitted.
"use strict";
var Album;
(function (Album) {
   Album[Album["JimmyEatWorldFutures"] = 1] = "JimmyEatWorldFutures";
   Album[Album["TubRingZooHypothesis"] = 2] = "TubRingZooHypothesis";
   Album[Album["DogFashionDiscoAdultery"] = 3] = "DogFashionDiscoAdultery";
})(Album || (Album = {}));
const selectedAlbum = 1 /* Album.JimmyEatWorldFutures */;
if (selectedAlbum === 1 /* Album.JimmyEatWorldFutures */) {
   console.log("That is a great choice.");
}

# Remove Comments - removeComments
Strips all comments from TypeScript files when converting into JavaScript. Defaults to false.

export const helloWorldPTBR = "Ol√° Mundo";
When removeComments is set to true:
export const helloWorldPTBR = "Ol√° Mundo";
 
Try
Without setting removeComments or having it as false:
/** The translation of 'Hello world' into Portuguese */
export const helloWorldPTBR = "Ol√° Mundo";
 
Try
This means that your comments will show up in the JavaScript code.
Released:

# Source Map - sourceMap
Enables the generation of sourcemap files. These files allow debuggers and other tools to display the original TypeScript source code when actually working with the emitted JavaScript files. Source map files are emitted as .js.map (or .jsx.map) files next to the corresponding .js output file.
The .js files will in turn contain a sourcemap comment to indicate where the files are to external tools, for example:
// helloWorld.ts
export declare const helloWorld = "hi";
Compiling with sourceMap set to true creates the following JavaScript file:
// helloWorld.js
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports.helloWorld = "hi";
//# sourceMappingURL=// helloWorld.js.map
And this also generates this json map:
// helloWorld.js.map

# Strip Internal - stripInternal
Do not emit declarations for code that has an @internal annotation in its JSDoc comment. This is an internal compiler option; use at your own risk, because the compiler does not check that the result is valid.

Try
Imports fine with allowJs enabled:

# Check JS - checkJs
Works in tandem with allowJs. When checkJs is enabled then errors are reported in JavaScript files. This is the equivalent of including // @ts-check at the top of all JavaScript files which are included in your project.
For example, this is incorrect JavaScript according to the parseFloat type definition which comes with TypeScript:
// parseFloat only takes a string
module.exports.pi = parseFloat(3.142);
When imported into a TypeScript module:
// @filename: constants.js
module.exports.pi = parseFloat(3.142);
 
// @filename: index.ts
import { pi } from "./constants";
console.log(pi);
Try
You will not get any errors. However, if you turn on checkJs then you will get error messages from the JavaScript file.
// @filename: constants.js
module.exports.pi = parseFloat(3.142);
Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.

ts-sql-plugin ‚Äî Adds SQL linting with a template strings SQL builder.
typescript-styled-plugin ‚Äî Provides CSS linting inside template strings .
typescript-eslint-language-service ‚Äî Provides eslint error messaging and fix-its inside the compiler‚Äôs output.

#Interop Constraints
# Allow Synthetic Default Imports - allowSyntheticDefaultImports
When set to true, allowSyntheticDefaultImports allows you to write an import like:
import React from "react";
instead of:
import * as React from "react";
When the module does not explicitly specify a default export.
For example, without allowSyntheticDefaultImports as true:
// @filename: utilFunctions.js
const getStringLength = (str) => str.length;
 
module.exports = {
 getStringLength,
};
 
// @filename: index.ts
import utils from "./utilFunctions";
Module '"/home/runner/work/TypeScript-Website/TypeScript-Website/packages/typescriptlang-org/utilFunctions"' has no default export.
 
const count = utils.getStringLength("Check JS");
Try
This code raises an error because there isn‚Äôt a default object which you can import. Even though it feels like it should. For convenience, transpilers like Babel will automatically create a default if one isn‚Äôt created. Making the module look a bit more like:
// @filename: utilFunctions.js
const getStringLength = (str) => str.length;
const allFunctions = {
 getStringLength,
};
module.exports = allFunctions;
module.exports.default = allFunctions;
This flag does not affect the JavaScript emitted by TypeScript, it‚Äôs only for the type checking. This option brings the behavior of TypeScript in-line with Babel, where extra code is emitted to make using a default export of a module more ergonomic.
Default:
true if esModuleInterop is enabled, module is system, or moduleResolution is bundler; false otherwise.

# Erasable Syntax Only - erasableSyntaxOnly
Node.js supports running TypeScript files directly as of v23.6; however, only TypeScript-specific syntax that does not have runtime semantics are supported under this mode. In other words, it must be possible to easily erase any TypeScript-specific syntax from a file, leaving behind a valid JavaScript file.
That means the following constructs are not supported:
enum declarations
namespaces and modules with runtime code
parameter properties in classes
Non-ECMAScript import = and export = assignments
// ‚ùå error: An `import ... = require(...)` alias
import foo = require("foo");
// ‚ùå error: A namespace with runtime code.
namespace container {
 foo.method();
 export type Bar = string;
}
// ‚ùå error: An `import =` alias
import Bar = container.Bar;
class Point {
 // ‚ùå error: Parameter properties
 constructor(public x: number, public y: number) {}
}
// ‚ùå error: An `export =` assignment.
export = Point;
// ‚ùå error: An enum declaration.
enum Direction {
 Up,
 Down,
 Left,
 Right,
}
Similar tools like ts-blank-space or Amaro (the underlying library for type-stripping in Node.js) have the same limitations. These tools will provide helpful error messages if they encounter code that doesn‚Äôt meet these requirements, but you still won‚Äôt find out your code doesn‚Äôt work until you actually try to run it.
The --erasableSyntaxOnly flag will cause TypeScript to error on most TypeScript-specific constructs that have runtime behavior.
class C {
   constructor(public x: number) { }
   //          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   // error! This syntax is not allowed when 'erasableSyntaxOnly' is enabled.
   }
}
Typically, you will want to combine this flag with the --verbatimModuleSyntax, which ensures that a module contains the appropriate import syntax, and that import elision does not take place.
# ES Module Interop - esModuleInterop
By default (with esModuleInterop false or not set) TypeScript treats CommonJS/AMD/UMD modules similar to ES6 modules. In doing this, there are two parts in particular which turned out to be flawed assumptions:
a namespace import like import * as moment from "moment" acts the same as const moment = require("moment")
a default import like import moment from "moment" acts the same as const moment = require("moment").default
This mis-match causes these two issues:
the ES6 modules spec states that a namespace import (import * as x) can only be an object, by having TypeScript treating it the same as = require("x") then TypeScript allowed for the import to be treated as a function and be callable. That‚Äôs not valid according to the spec.
while accurate to the ES6 modules spec, most libraries with CommonJS/AMD/UMD modules didn‚Äôt conform as strictly as TypeScript‚Äôs implementation.
Turning on esModuleInterop will fix both of these problems in the code transpiled by TypeScript. The first changes the behavior in the compiler, the second is fixed by two new helper functions which provide a shim to ensure compatibility in the emitted JavaScript:
import * as fs from "fs";
import _ from "lodash";
fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf8");
_.chunk(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2);
With esModuleInterop disabled:
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
const fs = require("fs");
const lodash_1 = require("lodash");
fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf8");
lodash_1.default.chunk(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2);
 
Try
With esModuleInterop set to true:
"use strict";
var __createBinding = (this && this.__createBinding) || (Object.create ? (function(o, m, k, k2) {
   if (k2 === undefined) k2 = k;
   var desc = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(m, k);
   if (!desc || ("get" in desc ? !m.__esModule : desc.writable || desc.configurable)) {
     desc = { enumerable: true, get: function() { return m[k]; } };
   }
   Object.defineProperty(o, k2, desc);
}) : (function(o, m, k, k2) {
   if (k2 === undefined) k2 = k;
   o[k2] = m[k];
}));
var __setModuleDefault = (this && this.__setModuleDefault) || (Object.create ? (function(o, v) {
   Object.defineProperty(o, "default", { enumerable: true, value: v });
}) : function(o, v) {
   o["default"] = v;
});
var __importStar = (this && this.__importStar) || (function () {
   var ownKeys = function(o) {
       ownKeys = Object.getOwnPropertyNames || function (o) {
           var ar = [];
           for (var k in o) if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o, k)) ar[ar.length] = k;
           return ar;
       };
       return ownKeys(o);
   };
   return function (mod) {
       if (mod && mod.__esModule) return mod;
       var result = {};
       if (mod != null) for (var k = ownKeys(mod), i = 0; i < k.length; i++) if (k[i] !== "default") __createBinding(result, mod, k[i]);
       __setModuleDefault(result, mod);
       return result;
   };
})();
var __importDefault = (this && this.__importDefault) || function (mod) {
   return (mod && mod.__esModule) ? mod : { "default": mod };
};
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
const fs = __importStar(require("fs"));
const lodash_1 = __importDefault(require("lodash"));
fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf8");
lodash_1.default.chunk(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2);
 
Try
Note: The namespace import import * as fs from "fs" only accounts for properties which are owned (basically properties set on the object and not via the prototype chain) on the imported object. If the module you‚Äôre importing defines its API using inherited properties, you need to use the default import form (import fs from "fs"), or disable esModuleInterop.
Note: You can make JS emit terser by enabling importHelpers:
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
const tslib_1 = require("tslib");
const fs = tslib_1.__importStar(require("fs"));
const lodash_1 = tslib_1.__importDefault(require("lodash"));
fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf8");
lodash_1.default.chunk(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2);

Enabling esModuleInterop will also enable allowSyntheticDefaultImports.

# Force Consistent Casing In File Names - forceConsistentCasingInFileNames
TypeScript follows the case sensitivity rules of the file system it‚Äôs running on. This can be problematic if some developers are working in a case-sensitive file system and others aren‚Äôt. If a file attempts to import fileManager.ts by specifying ./FileManager.ts the file will be found in a case-insensitive file system, but not on a case-sensitive file system.
When this option is set, TypeScript will issue an error if a program tries to include a file by a casing different from the casing on disk.

# Isolated Modules - isolatedModules
While you can use TypeScript to produce JavaScript code from TypeScript code, it‚Äôs also common to use other transpilers such as Babel to do this. However, other transpilers only operate on a single file at a time, which means they can‚Äôt apply code transforms that depend on understanding the full type system. This restriction also applies to TypeScript‚Äôs ts.transpileModule API which is used by some build tools.
These limitations can cause runtime problems with some TypeScript features like const enums and namespaces. Setting the isolatedModules flag tells TypeScript to warn you if you write certain code that can‚Äôt be correctly interpreted by a single-file transpilation process.
It does not change the behavior of your code, or otherwise change the behavior of TypeScript‚Äôs checking and emitting process.
Some examples of code which does not work when isolatedModules is enabled.
Exports of Non-Value Identifiers
In TypeScript, you can import a type and then subsequently export it:
import { someType, someFunction } from "someModule";
 
someFunction();
 
export { someType, someFunction };
Try
Because there‚Äôs no value for someType, the emitted export will not try to export it (this would be a runtime error in JavaScript):
export { someFunction };
Single-file transpilers don‚Äôt know whether someType produces a value or not, so it‚Äôs an error to export a name that only refers to a type.
Non-Module Files
If isolatedModules is set, namespaces are only allowed in modules (which means it has some form of import/export). An error occurs if a namespace is found in a non-module file:
namespace Instantiated {
Namespaces are not allowed in global script files when 'isolatedModules' is enabled. If this file is not intended to be a global script, set 'moduleDetection' to 'force' or add an empty 'export {}' statement.
 export const x = 1;
}
Try
This restriction doesn‚Äôt apply to .d.ts files.
References to const enum members
In TypeScript, when you reference a const enum member, the reference is replaced by its actual value in the emitted JavaScript. Changing this TypeScript:
declare const enum Numbers {
 Zero = 0,
 One = 1,
}
console.log(Numbers.Zero + Numbers.One);
Try
To this JavaScript:
"use strict";
console.log(0 + 1);
 
Try
Without knowledge of the values of these members, other transpilers can‚Äôt replace the references to Numbers, which would be a runtime error if left alone (since there are no Numbers object at runtime). Because of this, when isolatedModules is set, it is an error to reference an ambient const enum member.
Default:
true if verbatimModuleSyntax; false otherwise.

# Preserve Symlinks - preserveSymlinks
This is to reflect the same flag in Node.js; which does not resolve the real path of symlinks.
This flag also exhibits the opposite behavior to Webpack‚Äôs resolve.symlinks option (i.e. setting TypeScript‚Äôs preserveSymlinks to true parallels setting Webpack‚Äôs resolve.symlinks to false, and vice-versa).
With this enabled, references to modules and packages (e.g. imports and /// <reference type="..." /> directives) are all resolved relative to the location of the symbolic link file, rather than relative to the path that the symbolic link resolves to.

# Verbatim Module Syntax - verbatimModuleSyntax
By default, TypeScript does something called import elision. Basically, if you write something like
import { Car } from "./car";
export function drive(car: Car) {
 // ...
}
TypeScript detects that you‚Äôre only using an import for types and drops the import entirely. Your output JavaScript might look something like this:
export function drive(car) {
 // ...
}
Most of the time this is good, because if Car isn‚Äôt a value that‚Äôs exported from ./car, we‚Äôll get a runtime error.
But it does add a layer of complexity for certain edge cases. For example, notice there‚Äôs no statement like import "./car"; - the import was dropped entirely. That actually makes a difference for modules that have side-effects or not.
TypeScript‚Äôs emit strategy for JavaScript also has another few layers of complexity - import elision isn‚Äôt always just driven by how an import is used - it often consults how a value is declared as well. So it‚Äôs not always clear whether code like the following
export { Car } from "./car";
should be preserved or dropped. If Car is declared with something like a class, then it can be preserved in the resulting JavaScript file. But if Car is only declared as a type alias or interface, then the JavaScript file shouldn‚Äôt export Car at all.
While TypeScript might be able to make these emit decisions based on information from across files, not every compiler can.
The type modifier on imports and exports helps with these situations a bit. We can make it explicit whether an import or export is only being used for type analysis, and can be dropped entirely in JavaScript files by using the type modifier.
// This statement can be dropped entirely in JS output
import type * as car from "./car";
// The named import/export 'Car' can be dropped in JS output
import { type Car } from "./car";
export { type Car } from "./car";
type modifiers are not quite useful on their own - by default, module elision will still drop imports, and nothing forces you to make the distinction between type and plain imports and exports. So TypeScript has the flag --importsNotUsedAsValues to make sure you use the type modifier, --preserveValueImports to prevent some module elision behavior, and --isolatedModules to make sure that your TypeScript code works across different compilers. Unfortunately, understanding the fine details of those 3 flags is hard, and there are still some edge cases with unexpected behavior.
TypeScript 5.0 introduces a new option called --verbatimModuleSyntax to simplify the situation. The rules are much simpler - any imports or exports without a type modifier are left around. Anything that uses the type modifier is dropped entirely.
// Erased away entirely.
import type { A } from "a";
// Rewritten to 'import { b } from "bcd";'
import { b, type c, type d } from "bcd";
// Rewritten to 'import {} from "xyz";'
import { type xyz } from "xyz";
With this new option, what you see is what you get.
That does have some implications when it comes to module interop though. Under this flag, ECMAScript imports and exports won‚Äôt be rewritten to require calls when your settings or file extension implied a different module system. Instead, you‚Äôll get an error. If you need to emit code that uses require and module.exports, you‚Äôll have to use TypeScript‚Äôs module syntax that predates ES2015:
Input TypeScript
Output JavaScript
import foo = require("foo");
const foo = require("foo");
function foo() {}
function bar() {}
function baz() {}
export = {
 foo,
 bar,
 baz,
};
function foo() {}
function bar() {}
function baz() {}
module.exports = {
 foo,
 bar,
 baz,
};

While this is a limitation, it does help make some issues more obvious. For example, it‚Äôs very common to forget to set the type field in package.json under --module node16. As a result, developers would start writing CommonJS modules instead of ES modules without realizing it, giving surprising lookup rules and JavaScript output. This new flag ensures that you‚Äôre intentional about the file type you‚Äôre using because the syntax is intentionally different.
Because --verbatimModuleSyntax provides a more consistent story than --importsNotUsedAsValues and --preserveValueImports, those two existing flags are being deprecated in its favor.

# Imports Not Used As Values - importsNotUsedAsValues
Deprecated in favor of verbatimModuleSyntax.
This flag controls how import works, there are 3 different options:
remove: The default behavior of dropping import statements which only reference types.
preserve: Preserves all import statements whose values or types are never used. This can cause imports/side-effects to be preserved.
error: This preserves all imports (the same as the preserve option), but will error when a value import is only used as a type. This might be useful if you want to ensure no values are being accidentally imported, but still make side-effect imports explicit.
This flag works because you can use import type to explicitly create an import statement which should never be emitted into JavaScript.

# Preserve Value Imports - preserveValueImports
Deprecated in favor of verbatimModuleSyntax.
There are some cases where TypeScript can‚Äôt detect that you‚Äôre using an import. For example, take the following code:
import { Animal } from "./animal.js";
eval("console.log(new Animal().isDangerous())");
or code using ‚ÄòCompiles to HTML‚Äô languages like Svelte or Vue. preserveValueImports will prevent TypeScript from removing the import, even if it appears unused.
When combined with isolatedModules: imported types must be marked as type-only because compilers that process single files at a time have no way of knowing whether imports are values that appear unused, or a type that must be removed in order to avoid a runtime crash.

Turning suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors on suppresses reporting the error about implicit anys when indexing into objects, as shown in the following example:

Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type '"foo"' can't be used to index type '{ x: number; }'.

# JSX Factory - jsxFactory
Changes the function called in .js files when compiling JSX Elements using the classic JSX runtime. The most common change is to use "h" or "preact.h" instead of the default "React.createElement" if using preact.
For example, this TSX file:
import { h } from "preact";
const HelloWorld = () => <div>Hello</div>;
With jsxFactory: "h" looks like:
const preact_1 = require("preact");
const HelloWorld = () => (0, preact_1.h)("div", null, "Hello");
 
Try
This option can be used on a per-file basis too similar to Babel‚Äôs /** @jsx h */ directive.
/** @jsx h */
import { h } from "preact";
Cannot find module 'preact' or its corresponding type declarations.
 
const HelloWorld = () => <div>Hello</div>;
Try
The factory chosen will also affect where the JSX namespace is looked up (for type checking information) before falling back to the global one.
If the factory is defined as React.createElement (the default), the compiler will check for React.JSX before checking for a global JSX. If the factory is defined as h, it will check for h.JSX before a global JSX.
Default:
React.createElement
Allowed:

# JSX Import Source - jsxImportSource
Declares the module specifier to be used for importing the jsx and jsxs factory functions when using jsx as "react-jsx" or "react-jsxdev" which were introduced in TypeScript 4.1.
With React 17 the library supports a new form of JSX transformation via a separate import.
For example with this code:
import React from "react";
function App() {
 return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}
Using this TSConfig:
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "target": "esnext",
   "module": "commonjs",
   "jsx": "react-jsx"
 }
}
The emitted JavaScript from TypeScript is:
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
const jsx_runtime_1 = require("react/jsx-runtime");
function App() {
   return (0, jsx_runtime_1.jsx)("h1", { children: "Hello World" });
}
 
Try
For example if you wanted to use "jsxImportSource": "preact", you need a tsconfig like:
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "target": "esnext",
   "module": "commonjs",
   "jsx": "react-jsx",
   "jsxImportSource": "preact",
   "types": ["preact"]
 }
}
Which generates code like:
function App() {
   return (0, jsx_runtime_1.jsx)("h1", { children: "Hello World" });
}
 
Try
Alternatively, you can use a per-file pragma to set this option, for example:
/** @jsxImportSource preact */
export function App() {
 return <h1>Hello World</h1>;

# Lib - lib
TypeScript includes a default set of type definitions for built-in JS APIs (like Math), as well as type definitions for things found in browser environments (like document). TypeScript also includes APIs for newer JS features matching the target you specify; for example the definition for Map is available if target is ES6 or newer.
You may want to change these for a few reasons:
Your program doesn‚Äôt run in a browser, so you don‚Äôt want the "dom" type definitions
Your runtime platform provides certain JavaScript API objects (maybe through polyfills), but doesn‚Äôt yet support the full syntax of a given ECMAScript version
You have polyfills or native implementations for some, but not all, of a higher level ECMAScript version
In TypeScript 4.5, lib files can be overridden by npm modules, find out more in the blog.

# Lib Replacement - libReplacement
TypeScript 4.5 introduced the possibility of substituting the default lib files with custom ones. All built-in library files would first try to be resolved from packages named @typescript/lib-*. For example, you could lock your dom libraries onto a specific version of the @types/web package with the following package.json:
{
 "devDependencies": {
   "@typescript/lib-dom": "npm:@types/web@0.0.199"
 }
}
When installed, a package called @typescript/lib-dom should exist, and TypeScript would always look there when searching for lib.dom.d.ts.
The --libReplacement flag allows you to disable this behavior. If you‚Äôre not using any @typescript/lib-* packages, you can now disable those package lookups with --libReplacement false. In the future, --libReplacement false may become the default, so if you currently rely on the behavior you should consider explicitly enabling it with --libReplacement true.
Default:
true
# Module Detection - moduleDetection
This setting controls how TypeScript determines whether a file is a script or a module.
There are three choices:
"auto" (default) - TypeScript will not only look for import and export statements, but it will also check whether the "type" field in a package.json is set to "module" when running with module: nodenext or node16, and check whether the current file is a JSX file when running under jsx: react-jsx.
"legacy" - The same behavior as 4.6 and prior, usings import and export statements to determine whether a file is a module.
"force" - Ensures that every non-declaration file is treated as a module.
Default:
"auto": Treat files with imports, exports, import.meta, jsx (with jsx: react-jsx), or esm format (with module: node16+) as modules.
Allowed:
legacy
auto
force
Released:

# No Lib - noLib
Disables the automatic inclusion of any library files. If this option is set, lib is ignored.
TypeScript cannot compile anything without a set of interfaces for key primitives like: Array, Boolean, Function, IArguments, Number, Object, RegExp, and String. It is expected that if you use noLib you will be including your own type definitions for these.

# React Namespace - reactNamespace
Use jsxFactory instead. Specify the object invoked for createElement when targeting react for TSX files.
Default:
React
Released:
1.8
# Target - target
Modern browsers support all ES6 features, so ES6 is a good choice. You might choose to set a lower target if your code is deployed to older environments, or a higher target if your code is guaranteed to run in newer environments.
The target setting changes which JS features are downleveled and which are left intact. For example, an arrow function () => this will be turned into an equivalent function expression if target is ES5 or lower.
Changing target also changes the default value of lib. You may ‚Äúmix and match‚Äù target and lib settings as desired, but you could just set target for convenience.
For developer platforms like Node there are baselines for the target, depending on the type of platform and its version. You can find a set of community organized TSConfigs at tsconfig/bases, which has configurations for common platforms and their versions.
The special ESNext value refers to the highest version your version of TypeScript supports. This setting should be used with caution, since it doesn‚Äôt mean the same thing between different TypeScript versions and can make upgrades less predictable.

# Explain Files - explainFiles
Print names of files which TypeScript sees as a part of your project and the reason they are part of the compilation.
For example, with this project of just a single index.ts file
example
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
Using a tsconfig.json which has explainFiles set to true:
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "target": "es5",
   "module": "commonjs",
   "explainFiles": true
 }
}
Running TypeScript against this folder would have output like this:
‚ùØ tsc
node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.d.ts
 Default library for target 'es5'
node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es5.d.ts
 Library referenced via 'es5' from file 'node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.d.ts'
node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.dom.d.ts
 Library referenced via 'dom' from file 'node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.d.ts'
node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.webworker.importscripts.d.ts
 Library referenced via 'webworker.importscripts' from
   file 'node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.d.ts'
node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.scripthost.d.ts
 Library referenced via 'scripthost'
   from file 'node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.d.ts'
index.ts
 Matched by include pattern '**/*' in 'tsconfig.json'
The output above show:
The initial lib.d.ts lookup based on target, and the chain of .d.ts files which are referenced
The index.ts file located via the default pattern of include
This option is intended for debugging how a file has become a part of your compile.

# List Emitted Files - listEmittedFiles
Print names of generated files part of the compilation to the terminal.
This flag is useful in two cases:
You want to transpile TypeScript as a part of a build chain in the terminal where the filenames are processed in the next command.
You are not sure that TypeScript has included a file you expected, as a part of debugging the file inclusion settings.
For example:
example
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
With:
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "declaration": true,
   "listEmittedFiles": true
 }
}
Would echo paths like:
$ npm run tsc
path/to/example/index.js
path/to/example/index.d.ts
Normally, TypeScript would return silently on success.
Released:

# List Files - listFiles
Print names of files part of the compilation. This is useful when you are not sure that TypeScript has included a file you expected.
For example:
example
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
With:
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "listFiles": true
 }
}
Would echo paths like:
$ npm run tsc
path/to/example/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.d.ts
path/to/example/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es5.d.ts
path/to/example/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.dom.d.ts

This can save time during compilation at the expense of type-system accuracy. For example, two libraries could define two copies of the same type in an inconsistent way. Rather than doing a full check of all d.ts files, TypeScript will type check the code you specifically refer to in your app‚Äôs source code.
A common case where you might think to use skipLibCheck is when there are two copies of a library‚Äôs types in your node_modules. In these cases, you should consider using a feature like yarn‚Äôs resolutions to ensure there is only one copy of that dependency in your tree or investigate how to ensure there is only one copy by understanding the dependency resolution to fix the issue without additional tooling.
Another possibility is when you are migrating between TypeScript releases and the changes cause breakages in node_modules and the JS standard libraries which you do not want to deal with during the TypeScript update.
Note, that if these issues come from the TypeScript standard library you can replace the library using TypeScript 4.5‚Äôs lib replacement technique.

#Command Line
#Watch Options
TypeScript 3.8 shipped a new strategy for watching directories, which is crucial for efficiently picking up changes to node_modules.
On operating systems like Linux, TypeScript installs directory watchers (as opposed to file watchers) on node_modules and many of its subdirectories to detect changes in dependencies. This is because the number of available file watchers is often eclipsed by the number of files in node_modules, whereas there are way fewer directories to track.
Because every project might work better under different strategies, and this new approach might not work well for your workflows, TypeScript 3.8 introduces a new watchOptions field which allows users to tell the compiler/language service which watching strategies should be used to keep track of files and directories.
# Assume Changes Only Affect Direct Dependencies - assumeChangesOnlyAffectDirectDependencies
When this option is enabled, TypeScript will avoid rechecking/rebuilding all truly possibly-affected files, and only recheck/rebuild files that have changed as well as files that directly import them.
This can be considered a ‚Äòfast & loose‚Äô implementation of the watching algorithm, which can drastically reduce incremental rebuild times at the expense of having to run the full build occasionally to get all compiler error messages.
Released:
3.8
Watch Options
You can configure the how TypeScript --watch works. This section is mainly for handling case where fs.watch and fs.watchFile have additional constraints like on Linux. You can read more at Configuring Watch.
# Watch File - watchFile
The strategy for how individual files are watched.
fixedPollingInterval: Check every file for changes several times a second at a fixed interval.
priorityPollingInterval: Check every file for changes several times a second, but use heuristics to check certain types of files less frequently than others.
dynamicPriorityPolling: Use a dynamic queue where less-frequently modified files will be checked less often.
useFsEvents (the default): Attempt to use the operating system/file system‚Äôs native events for file changes.

priorityPollingInterval: Check every file for changes several times a second, but use heuristics to check certain types of files less frequently than others.
dynamicPriorityPolling: Use a dynamic queue where less-frequently modified files will be checked less often.
synchronousWatchDirectory: Disable deferred watching on directories. Deferred watching is useful when lots of file changes might occur at once (e.g. a change in node_modules from running npm install), but you might want to disable it with this flag for some less-common setups.

Type Acquisition
Type Acquisition is only important for JavaScript projects. In TypeScript projects you need to include the types in your projects explicitly. However, for JavaScript projects, the TypeScript tooling will download types for your modules in the background and outside of your node_modules folder.
# Enable - enable
Disables automatic type acquisition in JavaScript projects:
{
 "typeAcquisition": {
   "enable": false
 }
}
# Include - include
If you have a JavaScript project where TypeScript needs additional guidance to understand global dependencies, or have disabled the built-in inference via disableFilenameBasedTypeAcquisition.
You can use include to specify which types should be used from DefinitelyTyped:
{
 "typeAcquisition": {
   "include": ["jquery"]
 }
}
# Exclude - exclude
Offers a config for disabling the type-acquisition for a certain module in JavaScript projects. This can be useful for projects which include other libraries in testing infrastructure which aren‚Äôt needed in the main application.
{
 "typeAcquisition": {
   "exclude": ["jest", "mocha"]
 }
}
# Disable Filename Based Type Acquisition - disableFilenameBasedTypeAcquisition
TypeScript‚Äôs type acquisition can infer what types should be added based on filenames in a project. This means that having a file like jquery.js in your project would automatically download the types for JQuery from DefinitelyTyped.
You can disable this via disableFilenameBasedTypeAcquisition.

 "typeAcquisition": {
   "disableFilenameBasedTypeAcquisition": true

tsc
# Emit JS for just the index.ts with the compiler defaults
tsc index.ts
# Emit JS for any .ts files in the folder src, with the default settings
tsc src/*.ts
# Emit files referenced in with the compiler settings from tsconfig.production.json
tsc --project tsconfig.production.json
# Emit d.ts files for a js file with showing compiler options which are booleans
tsc index.js --declaration --emitDeclarationOnly
# Emit a single .js file from two files via compiler options which take string arguments

Project References
Project references allows you to structure your TypeScript programs into smaller pieces, available in TypeScript 3.0 and newer.
By doing this, you can greatly improve build times, enforce logical separation between components, and organize your code in new and better ways.
We‚Äôre also introducing a new mode for tsc, the --build flag, that works hand in hand with project references to enable faster TypeScript builds.
An Example Project
Let‚Äôs look at a fairly normal program and see how project references can help us better organize it. Imagine you have a project with two modules, converter and units, and a corresponding test file for each:
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ converter.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ units.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ converter-tests.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ units-tests.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
The test files import the implementation files and do some testing:
// converter-tests.ts
import * as converter from "../src/converter";
assert.areEqual(converter.celsiusToFahrenheit(0), 32);
Previously, this structure was rather awkward to work with if you used a single tsconfig file:
It was possible for the implementation files to import the test files
It wasn‚Äôt possible to build test and src at the same time without having src appear in the output folder name, which you probably don‚Äôt want
Changing just the internals in the implementation files required typechecking the tests again, even though this wouldn‚Äôt ever cause new errors
Changing just the tests required typechecking the implementation again, even if nothing changed
You could use multiple tsconfig files to solve some of those problems, but new ones would appear:
There‚Äôs no built-in up-to-date checking, so you end up always running tsc twice
Invoking tsc twice incurs more startup time overhead
tsc -w can‚Äôt run on multiple config files at once
Project references can solve all of these problems and more.
What is a Project Reference?
tsconfig.json files have a new top-level property, references. It‚Äôs an array of objects that specifies projects to reference:
{
   "compilerOptions": {
       // The usual
   },
   "references": [
       { "path": "../src" }
   ]
}
The path property of each reference can point to a directory containing a tsconfig.json file, or to the config file itself (which may have any name).
When you reference a project, new things happen:
Importing modules from a referenced project will instead load its output declaration file (.d.ts)
If the referenced project produces an outFile, the output file .d.ts file‚Äôs declarations will be visible in this project
Build mode (see below) will automatically build the referenced project if needed
By separating into multiple projects, you can greatly improve the speed of typechecking and compiling, reduce memory usage when using an editor, and improve enforcement of the logical groupings of your program.
composite
Referenced projects must have the new composite setting enabled. This setting is needed to ensure TypeScript can quickly determine where to find the outputs of the referenced project. Enabling the composite flag changes a few things:
The rootDir setting, if not explicitly set, defaults to the directory containing the tsconfig file
All implementation files must be matched by an include pattern or listed in the files array. If this constraint is violated, tsc will inform you which files weren‚Äôt specified
declaration must be turned on
declarationMap
We‚Äôve also added support for declaration source maps. If you enable declarationMap, you‚Äôll be able to use editor features like ‚ÄúGo to Definition‚Äù and Rename to transparently navigate and edit code across project boundaries in supported editors.
Caveats for Project References
Project references have a few trade-offs you should be aware of.
Because dependent projects make use of .d.ts files that are built from their dependencies, you‚Äôll either have to check in certain build outputs or build a project after cloning it before you can navigate the project in an editor without seeing spurious errors.
When using VS Code (since TS 3.7) we have a behind-the-scenes in-memory .d.ts generation process that should be able to mitigate this, but it has some perf implications. For very large composite projects you might want to disable this using disableSourceOfProjectReferenceRedirect option.
Additionally, to preserve compatibility with existing build workflows, tsc will not automatically build dependencies unless invoked with the --build switch. Let‚Äôs learn more about --build.
Build Mode for TypeScript
A long-awaited feature is smart incremental builds for TypeScript projects. In 3.0 you can use the --build flag with tsc. This is effectively a new entry point for tsc that behaves more like a build orchestrator than a simple compiler.
Running tsc --build (tsc -b for short) will do the following:
Find all referenced projects
Detect if they are up-to-date
Build out-of-date projects in the correct order
You can provide tsc -b with multiple config file paths (e.g. tsc -b src test). Just like tsc -p, specifying the config file name itself is unnecessary if it‚Äôs named tsconfig.json.
tsc -b Commandline
You can specify any number of config files:
> tsc -b                            # Use the tsconfig.json in the current directory
> tsc -b src                        # Use src/tsconfig.json
> tsc -b foo/prd.tsconfig.json bar  # Use foo/prd.tsconfig.json and bar/tsconfig.json
Don‚Äôt worry about ordering the files you pass on the commandline - tsc will re-order them if needed so that dependencies are always built first.
There are also some flags specific to tsc -b:
--verbose: Prints out verbose logging to explain what‚Äôs going on (may be combined with any other flag)
--dry: Shows what would be done but doesn‚Äôt actually build anything
--clean: Deletes the outputs of the specified projects (may be combined with --dry)
--force: Act as if all projects are out of date
--watch: Watch mode (may not be combined with any flag except --verbose)
Caveats
Normally, tsc will produce outputs (.js and .d.ts) in the presence of syntax or type errors, unless noEmitOnError is on. Doing this in an incremental build system would be very bad - if one of your out-of-date dependencies had a new error, you‚Äôd only see it once because a subsequent build would skip building the now up-to-date project. For this reason, tsc -b effectively acts as if noEmitOnError is enabled for all projects.
If you check in any build outputs (.js, .d.ts, .d.ts.map, etc.), you may need to run a --force build after certain source control operations depending on whether your source control tool preserves timestamps between the local copy and the remote copy.
MSBuild
If you have an msbuild project, you can enable build mode by adding
   <TypeScriptBuildMode>true</TypeScriptBuildMode>
to your proj file. This will enable automatic incremental build as well as cleaning.
Note that as with tsconfig.json / -p, existing TypeScript project properties will not be respected - all settings should be managed using your tsconfig file.
Some teams have set up msbuild-based workflows wherein tsconfig files have the same implicit graph ordering as the managed projects they are paired with. If your solution is like this, you can continue to use msbuild with tsc -p along with project references; these are fully interoperable.
Guidance
Overall Structure
With more tsconfig.json files, you‚Äôll usually want to use Configuration file inheritance to centralize your common compiler options. This way you can change a setting in one file rather than having to edit multiple files.
Another good practice is to have a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù tsconfig.json file that simply has references to all of your leaf-node projects and sets files to an empty array (otherwise the solution file will cause double compilation of files). Note that starting with 3.0, it is no longer an error to have an empty files array if you have at least one reference in a tsconfig.json file.
This presents a simple entry point; e.g. in the TypeScript repo we simply run tsc -b src to build all endpoints because we list all the subprojects in src/tsconfig.json
You can see these patterns in the TypeScript repo - see src/tsconfig_base.json, src/tsconfig.json, and src/tsc/tsconfig.json as key examples.
Structuring for relative modules
In general, not much is needed to transition a repo using relative modules. Simply place a tsconfig.json file in each subdirectory of a given parent folder, and add references to these config files to match the intended layering of the program. You will need to either set the outDir to an explicit subfolder of the output folder, or set the rootDir to the common root of all project folders.
Structuring for outFiles
Layout for compilations using outFile is more flexible because relative paths don‚Äôt matter as much. The TypeScript repo itself is a good reference here - we have some ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù projects and some ‚Äúendpoint‚Äù projects; ‚Äúendpoint‚Äù projects are kept as small as possible and pull in only the libraries they need.

Create a svelte.config.js configuration file and import the plugin:
// svelte.config.js
import preprocess from 'svelte-preprocess';
const config = {
 // Consult https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess
 // for more information about preprocessors
 preprocess: preprocess()
};
export default config;
You can now specify that script blocks are written in TypeScript:
<script lang="ts">
Vite
Vite supports importing .ts files out-of-the-box. It only performs transpilation and not type checking. It also requires that some compilerOptions have certain values. See the Vite docs for more details.

Configuring Watch
As of TypeScript 3.8 and onward, the Typescript compiler exposes configuration which controls how it watches files and directories. Prior to this version, configuration required the use of environment variables which are still available.
Background
The --watch implementation of the compiler relies on Node‚Äôs fs.watch and fs.watchFile. Each of these methods has pros and cons.
fs.watch relies on file system events to broadcast changes in the watched files and directories. The implementation of this command is OS dependent and unreliable - on many operating systems, it does not work as expected. Additionally, some operating systems limit the number of watches which can exist simultaneously (e.g. some flavors of Linux). Heavy use of fs.watch in large codebases has the potential to exceed these limits and result in undesirable behavior. However, because this implementation relies on an events-based model, CPU use is comparatively light. The compiler typically uses fs.watch to watch directories (e.g. source directories included by compiler configuration files and directories in which module resolution failed, among others). TypeScript uses these to augment potential failures in individual file watchers. However, there is a key limitation of this strategy: recursive watching of directories is supported on Windows and macOS, but not on Linux. This suggested a need for additional strategies for file and directory watching.
fs.watchFile uses polling and thus costs CPU cycles. However, fs.watchFile is by far the most reliable mechanism available to subscribe to the events from files and directories of interest. Under this strategy, the TypeScript compiler typically uses fs.watchFile to watch source files, config files, and files which appear missing based on reference statements. This means that the degree to which CPU usage will be higher when using fs.watchFile depends directly on number of files watched in the codebase.
Configuring file watching using a tsconfig.json
The suggested method of configuring watch behavior is through the new watchOptions section of tsconfig.json. We provide an example configuration below. See the following section for detailed descriptions of the settings available.
{
 // Some typical compiler options
 "compilerOptions": {
   "target": "es2020",
   "moduleResolution": "node"
   // ...
 },
 // NEW: Options for file/directory watching
 "watchOptions": {
   // Use native file system events for files and directories
   "watchFile": "useFsEvents",
   "watchDirectory": "useFsEvents",
   // Poll files for updates more frequently
   // when they're updated a lot.
   "fallbackPolling": "dynamicPriority",
   // Don't coalesce watch notification
   "synchronousWatchDirectory": true,
   // Finally, two additional settings for reducing the amount of possible
   // files to track  work from these directories
   "excludeDirectories": ["**/node_modules", "_build"],
   "excludeFiles": ["build/fileWhichChangesOften.ts"]
 }
}
For further details, see the release notes for Typescript 3.8.
Configuring file watching using environment variable TSC_WATCHFILE
Option
Description
PriorityPollingInterval
Use fs.watchFile, but use different polling intervals for source files, config files and missing files
DynamicPriorityPolling
Use a dynamic queue where frequently modified files are polled at shorter intervals, and unchanged files are polled less frequently
UseFsEvents
Use fs.watch. On operating systems that limit the number of active watches, fall back to fs.watchFile when a watcher fails to be created.
UseFsEventsWithFallbackDynamicPolling
Use fs.watch. On operating systems that limit the number of active watches, fall back to dynamic polling queues (as explained in DynamicPriorityPolling)
UseFsEventsOnParentDirectory
Use fs.watch on the parent directories of included files (yielding a compromise that results in lower CPU usage than pure fs.watchFile but potentially lower accuracy).
default (no value specified)
If environment variable TSC_NONPOLLING_WATCHER is set to true, use UseFsEventsOnParentDirectory. Otherwise, watch files using fs.watchFile with 250ms as the timeout for any file.

Configuring directory watching using environment variable TSC_WATCHDIRECTORY
For directory watches on platforms which don‚Äôt natively allow recursive directory watching (i.e. non macOS and Windows operating systems) is supported through recursively creating directory watchers for each child directory using different options selected by TSC_WATCHDIRECTORY.
NOTE: On platforms which support native recursive directory watching, the value of TSC_WATCHDIRECTORY is ignored.
Option
Description
RecursiveDirectoryUsingFsWatchFile
Use fs.watchFile to watch included directories and child directories.
RecursiveDirectoryUsingDynamicPriorityPolling
Use a dynamic polling queue to poll changes to included directories and child directories.
default (no value specified)
Use fs.watch to watch included directories and child directories.

Nightly Builds
A nightly build from the TypeScript‚Äôs main branch is published by midnight PST to npm. Here is how you can get it and use it with your tools.
Using npm
npm install -D typescript@next
Updating your IDE to use the nightly builds
You can also update your editor/IDE to use the nightly drop. You will typically need to install the package through npm. The rest of this section mostly assumes typescript@next is already installed.
Visual Studio Code
The VS Code website has documentation on selecting a workspace version of TypeScript. After installing a nightly version of TypeScript in your workspace, you can follow directions there, or simply update your workspace settings in the JSON view. A direct way to do this is to open or create your workspace‚Äôs .vscode/settings.json and add the following property:
"typescript.tsdk": "<path to your folder>/node_modules/typescript/lib"
Alternatively, if you simply want to run the nightly editing experience for JavaScript and TypeScript in Visual Studio Code without changing your workspace version, you can run the JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly Extension
Sublime Text
Update the Settings - User file with the following:
"typescript_tsdk": "<path to your folder>/node_modules/typescript/lib"
More information is available at the TypeScript Plugin for Sublime Text installation documentation.
Visual Studio 2013 and 2015
Note: Most changes do not require you to install a new version of the VS TypeScript plugin.
The nightly build currently does not include the full plugin setup, but we are working on publishing an installer on a nightly basis as well.
Download the VSDevMode.ps1 script.
Also see our wiki page on using a custom language service file.
From a PowerShell command window, run:
For VS 2015:
VSDevMode.ps1 14 -tsScript <path to your folder>/node_modules/typescript/lib
For VS 2013:
VSDevMode.ps1 12 -tsScript <path to your folder>/node_modules/typescript/lib
IntelliJ IDEA (Mac)
Go to Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > TypeScript:
TypeScript Version: If you installed with npm: /usr/local/lib/node_modules/typescript/lib
IntelliJ IDEA (Windows)
Go to File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > TypeScript:
TypeScript Version: If you installed with npm: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\typescript\lib
