      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      Welcome
      AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. 
      This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general 
      information about AWS KMS, see the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
           Note
           AWS KMS has replaced the term customer master key (CMK) with  AWS KMS key and KMS 
           key. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, AWS KMS is keeping some 
           variations of this term.
           AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming 
           languages and platforms (Java, Rust, Python, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs 
           provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS 
           services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), 
           managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS 
           SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.
      We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS.
      If you need to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when communicating with AWS, 
      use one of the FIPS endpoints in your preferred AWS Region. If you need communicate over IPv6, 
      use the dual-stack endpoint in your preferred AWS Region. For more information see Service 
      endpoints in the AWS Key Management Service topic of the Amazon Web Services General Reference
      and Dual-stack endpoint support in the KMS Developer Guide.
      All AWS KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). 
      AWS KMS recommends you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support 
      cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diﬃe-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic 
      Curve Ephemeral Diﬃe-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support 
      these modes.
      Signing Requests
      Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend 
      that you do not use your AWS account root access key ID and secret access key for everyday work. 
                                                                                 API Version 2014-11-01 1
      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      You can use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the AWS Security 
      Token Service (AWS STS) to generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests.
      All AWS KMS requests must be signed with Signature Version 4.
      Logging API Requests
      AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your 
      AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information 
      collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the 
      request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on 
      and ﬁnd your log ﬁles, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
      Additional Resources
      For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:
      • AWS Security Credentials - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials 
        used to access AWS.
      • Temporary Security Credentials - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and 
        use temporary security credentials.
      • Signature Version 4 Signing Process - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing 
        a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.
      Commonly Used API Operations
      Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most 
      applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and 
      assigning policies, by using the console.

      ConnectCustomKeyStore
      Connects or reconnects a custom key store to its backing key store. For an AWS CloudHSM key 
      store, ConnectCustomKeyStore connects the key store to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. 
      For an external key store, ConnectCustomKeyStore connects the key store to the external key 
      store proxy that communicates with your external key manager.
      The custom key store must be connected before you can create KMS keys in the key store or use 
      the KMS keys it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time.
      The connection process for a custom key store can take an extended amount of time to complete. 
      This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When 
      it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no 
      properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get 
      the connection state of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
      This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in AWS KMS, which combines the 
      convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a key store 
      that you own and manage.
      The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation might fail for various reasons. To ﬁnd the reason, use 
      the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the ConnectionErrorCode in the response. For 
      help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry.
      To ﬁx the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key 
      store, correct the error, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use
      ConnectCustomKeyStore again.
      AWS CloudHSM key store
      During the connection process for an AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS ﬁnds the AWS CloudHSM 
      cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects 
      to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the kmsuser CU, and rotates its password.
      To connect an AWS CloudHSM key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least 
      one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. 
      To add HSMs to the cluster, use the CreateHsm operation. Also, the kmsuser crypto user (CU) must 
      not be logged into the cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from using this account to log in.
      If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a AWS CloudHSM key store, see
      Troubleshooting an AWS CloudHSM key store in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      ConnectCustomKeyStore                                                     API Version 2014-11-01 10

      External key store
      When you connect an external key store that uses public endpoint connectivity, AWS KMS tests its 
      ability to communicate with your external key manager by sending a request via the external key 
      store proxy.
      When you connect to an external key store that uses VPC endpoint service connectivity, AWS KMS 
      establishes the networking elements that it needs to communicate with your external key manager 
      via the external key store proxy. This includes creating an interface endpoint to the VPC endpoint 
      service and a private hosted zone for traﬃc between AWS KMS and the VPC endpoint service.
      To connect an external key store, AWS KMS must be able to connect to the external key store 
      proxy, the external key store proxy must be able to communicate with your external key manager, 
      and the external key manager must be available for cryptographic operations.
      If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting an external key store, see Troubleshooting an 
      external key store in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a diﬀerent 
      AWS account.
      Required permissions: kms:ConnectCustomKeyStore (IAM policy)

      CreateAlias
      Creates a friendly name for a KMS key.
           Note
           Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For 
           details, see ABAC for AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      You can use an alias to identify a KMS key in the AWS KMS console, in the DescribeKey operation 
      and in cryptographic operations, such as Encrypt and GenerateDataKey. You can also change the 
      KMS key that's associated with the alias (UpdateAlias) or delete the alias (DeleteAlias) at any time. 
      These operations don't aﬀect the underlying KMS key.
      You can associate the alias with any customer managed key in the same AWS Region. Each alias is 
      associated with only one KMS key at a time, but a KMS key can have multiple aliases. A valid KMS 
      key is required. You can't create an alias without a KMS key.
      The alias must be unique in the account and Region, but you can have aliases with the same name 
      in diﬀerent Regions. For detailed information about aliases, see Aliases in AWS KMS in the  AWS Key 
      Management Service Developer Guide.
      This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you created, use the ListAliases
      operation.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a diﬀerent AWS account.
      Required permissions
      • kms:CreateAlias on the alias (IAM policy).
      • kms:CreateAlias on the KMS key (key policy).

      CreateCustomKeyStore
      Creates a custom key store backed by a key store that you own and manage. When you use a KMS 
      key in a custom key store for a cryptographic operation, the cryptographic operation is actually 
      performed in your key store using your keys. AWS KMS supports AWS CloudHSM key stores backed 
      by an AWS CloudHSM cluster and external key stores backed by an external key store proxy and 
      external key manager outside of AWS.
      This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in AWS KMS, which combines the 
      convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a key store 
      that you own and manage.
      Before you create the custom key store, the required elements must be in place and operational. 
      We recommend that you use the test tools that AWS KMS provides to verify the conﬁguration 
      your external key store proxy. For details about the required elements and veriﬁcation tests, see
      Assemble the prerequisites (for AWS CloudHSM key stores) or Assemble the prerequisites (for 
      external key stores) in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      To create a custom key store, use the following parameters.
      •
        To create an AWS CloudHSM key store, specify the CustomKeyStoreName,
        CloudHsmClusterId, KeyStorePassword, and TrustAnchorCertificate. The
        CustomKeyStoreType parameter is optional for AWS CloudHSM key stores. If you include it, 
        set it to the default value, AWS_CLOUDHSM. For help with failures, see Troubleshooting an AWS 
        CloudHSM key store in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      •
        To create an external key store, specify the CustomKeyStoreName and a
        CustomKeyStoreType of EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE. Also, specify values for
        XksProxyConnectivity, XksProxyAuthenticationCredential, XksProxyUriEndpoint, 
        and XksProxyUriPath. If your XksProxyConnectivity value is VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE, 
        specify the XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName parameter. For help with failures, see
        Troubleshooting an external key store in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
           Note
           For external key stores:
           Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating an external key store. 
           For details, see your external key manager documentation.
      CreateCustomKeyStore                                                      API Version 2014-11-01 22
      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
           When creating an external key store in the AWS KMS console, you can upload a 
           JSON-based proxy conﬁguration ﬁle with the desired values. You cannot use a 
           proxy conﬁguration with the CreateCustomKeyStore operation. However, you 
           can use the values in the ﬁle to help you determine the correct values for the
           CreateCustomKeyStore parameters.
      When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. Before 
      you can use your new custom key store, you need to use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to 
      connect a new AWS CloudHSM key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, or to connect a new external 
      key store to the external key store proxy for your external key manager. Even if you are not going 
      to use your custom key store immediately, you might want to connect it to verify that all settings 
      are correct and then disconnect it until you are ready to use it.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a diﬀerent 
      AWS account.
      Required permissions: kms:CreateCustomKeyStore (IAM policy).

         Enter the cluster ID of any active AWS CloudHSM cluster that is not already associated with a 
         custom key store. To ﬁnd the cluster ID, use the DescribeClusters operation.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 19. Maximum length of 24.
         Pattern: cluster-[2-7a-zA-Z]{11,16}
         Required: No
      CustomKeyStoreType
         Speciﬁes the type of custom key store. The default value is AWS_CLOUDHSM.
         For a custom key store backed by an AWS CloudHSM cluster, omit the parameter or enter
         AWS_CLOUDHSM. For a custom key store backed by an external key manager outside of AWS, 
         enter EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE. You cannot change this property after the key store is created.
         Type: String
         Valid Values: AWS_CLOUDHSM | EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE
         Required: No
      KeyStorePassword

      TrustAnchorCertiﬁcate
         Speciﬁes the certiﬁcate for an AWS CloudHSM key store. This parameter is required for custom 
         key stores with a CustomKeyStoreType of AWS_CLOUDHSM.
         Enter the content of the trust anchor certiﬁcate for the AWS CloudHSM cluster. This is the 
         content of the customerCA.crt ﬁle that you created when you initialized the cluster.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 5000.
         Required: No
      XksProxyAuthenticationCredential
         Speciﬁes an authentication credential for the external key store proxy (XKS proxy). 
         This parameter is required for all custom key stores with a CustomKeyStoreType of
         EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE.
         The XksProxyAuthenticationCredential has two required elements:
         RawSecretAccessKey, a secret key, and AccessKeyId, a unique 
         identiﬁer for the RawSecretAccessKey. For character requirements, see
         XksProxyAuthenticationCredentialType.
         AWS KMS uses this authentication credential to sign requests to the external key store proxy 
         on your behalf. This credential is unrelated to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and 
         AWS credentials.
         This parameter doesn't set or change the authentication credentials on the XKS proxy. It just 
         tells AWS KMS the credential that you established on your external key store proxy. If you rotate 
         your proxy authentication credential, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation to provide the 
         new credential to AWS KMS.
         Type: XksProxyAuthenticationCredentialType object
         Required: No
      XksProxyConnectivity
         Indicates how AWS KMS communicates with the external key store proxy. This parameter is 
         required for custom key stores with a CustomKeyStoreType of EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE.
      Request Parameters                                                       API Version 2014-11-01 26
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      API Reference
         If the external key store proxy uses a public endpoint, specify PUBLIC_ENDPOINT. If the 
         external key store proxy uses a Amazon VPC endpoint service for communication with 
         AWS KMS, specify VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE. For help making this choice, see Choosing a 
         connectivity option in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
         An Amazon VPC endpoint service keeps your communication with AWS KMS in a private address 
         space entirely within AWS, but it requires more conﬁguration, including establishing a Amazon 
         VPC with multiple subnets, a VPC endpoint service, a network load balancer, and a veriﬁed 
         private DNS name. A public endpoint is simpler to set up, but it might be slower and might 
         not fulﬁll your security requirements. You might consider testing with a public endpoint, and 
         then establishing a VPC endpoint service for production tasks. Note that this choice does not 
         determine the location of the external key store proxy. Even if you choose a VPC endpoint 
         service, the proxy can be hosted within the VPC or outside of AWS such as in your corporate 
         data center.
         Type: String
         Valid Values: PUBLIC_ENDPOINT | VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE
         Required: No
      XksProxyUriEndpoint
         Speciﬁes the endpoint that AWS KMS uses to send requests to the external key store proxy 
         (XKS proxy). This parameter is required for custom key stores with a CustomKeyStoreType of
         EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE.
         The protocol must be HTTPS. AWS KMS communicates on port 443. Do not specify the port in 
         the XksProxyUriEndpoint value.
         For external key stores with XksProxyConnectivity value of VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE, 
         specify https:// followed by the private DNS name of the VPC endpoint service.
         For external key stores with PUBLIC_ENDPOINT connectivity, this endpoint must be reachable 
         before you create the custom key store. AWS KMS connects to the external key store proxy 
         while creating the custom key store. For external key stores with VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE
         connectivity, AWS KMS connects when you call the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation.
         The value of this parameter must begin with https://. The remainder can contain upper and 
         lower case letters (A-Z and a-z), numbers (0-9), dots (.), and hyphens (-). Additional slashes (/
         and \) are not permitted.

      CreateGrant
      Adds a grant to a KMS key.
      A grant is a policy instrument that allows AWS principals to use KMS keys in cryptographic 
      operations. It also can allow them to view a KMS key (DescribeKey) and create and manage grants. 
      When authorizing access to a KMS key, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM 
      policies. Grants are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its 
      permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies.
      For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see Grants in AWS KMS in 
      the   AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . For examples of creating grants in several 
      programming languages, see Use CreateGrant with an AWS SDK or CLI.
      The CreateGrant operation returns a GrantToken and a GrantId.
      • When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief delay, usually less than ﬁve 
        minutes, until the grant is available throughout AWS KMS. This state is known as eventual 
        consistency. Once the grant has achieved eventual consistency, the grantee principal can use the 
        permissions in the grant without identifying the grant.
        However, to use the permissions in the grant immediately, use the GrantToken that
        CreateGrant returns. For details, see Using a grant token in the   AWS Key Management Service 
        Developer Guide .
      •
        The CreateGrant operation also returns a GrantId. You can use the GrantId and a key 
        identiﬁer to identify the grant in the RetireGrant and RevokeGrant operations. To ﬁnd the grant 
        ID, use the ListGrants or ListRetirableGrants operations.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, specify 
      the key ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

              displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
         AWS KMS supports the EncryptionContextEquals and EncryptionContextSubset grant 
         constraints, which allow the permissions in the grant only when the encryption context in the 
         request matches (EncryptionContextEquals) or includes (EncryptionContextSubset) 
         the encryption context speciﬁed in the constraint.
         The encryption context grant constraints are supported only on grant operations that 
         include an EncryptionContext parameter, such as cryptographic operations on symmetric 
         encryption KMS keys. Grants with grant constraints can include the DescribeKey and RetireGrant
         operations, but the constraint doesn't apply to these operations. If a grant with a grant 
         constraint includes the CreateGrant operation, the constraint requires that any grants 
         created with the CreateGrant permission have an equally strict or stricter encryption context 
         constraint.
         You cannot use an encryption context grant constraint for cryptographic operations with 
         asymmetric KMS keys or HMAC KMS keys. Operations with these keys don't support an 
         encryption context.

      CreateKey
      Creates a unique customer managed KMS key in your AWS account and Region. You can use a KMS 
      key in cryptographic operations, such as encryption and signing. Some AWS services let you use 
      KMS keys that you create and manage to protect your service resources.
      A KMS key is a logical representation of a cryptographic key. In addition to the key material used 
      in cryptographic operations, a KMS key includes metadata, such as the key ID, key policy, creation 
      date, description, and key state.
      Use the parameters of CreateKey to specify the type of KMS key, the source of its key material, its 
      key policy, description, tags, and other properties.
           Note
           AWS KMS has replaced the term customer master key (CMK) with  AWS KMS key and KMS 
           key. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, AWS KMS is keeping some 
           variations of this term.
      To create diﬀerent types of KMS keys, use the following guidance:
      Symmetric encryption KMS key
         By default, CreateKey creates a symmetric encryption KMS key with key material that KMS 
         generates. This is the basic and most widely used type of KMS key, and provides the best 
         performance.
         To create a symmetric encryption KMS key, you don't need to specify any parameters. 
         The default value for KeySpec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, the default value for KeyUsage,
         ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, and the default value for Origin, AWS_KMS, create a symmetric 
         encryption KMS key with KMS key material.
         If you need a key for basic encryption and decryption or you are creating a KMS key to 
         protect your resources in an AWS service, create a symmetric encryption KMS key. The key 
         material in a symmetric encryption key never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. You can use a 
         symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt and decrypt data up to 4,096 bytes, but they are 
         typically used to generate data keys and data keys pairs. For details, see GenerateDataKey and
         GenerateDataKeyPair.
      CreateKey                                                                 API Version 2014-11-01 46
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     API Reference
      Asymmetric KMS keys
         To create an asymmetric KMS key, use the KeySpec parameter to specify the type of key 
         material in the KMS key. Then, use the KeyUsage parameter to determine whether the KMS key 
         will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these properties after 
         the KMS key is created.
         Asymmetric KMS keys contain an RSA key pair, Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pair, ML-DSA key pair 
         or an SM2 key pair (China Regions only). The private key in an asymmetric KMS key never 
         leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the GetPublicKey operation to download 
         the public key so it can be used outside of AWS KMS. Each KMS key can have only one key 
         usage. KMS keys with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt and decrypt data or sign and verify 
         messages (but not both). KMS keys with NIST-recommended ECC key pairs can be used to sign 
         and verify messages or derive shared secrets (but not both). KMS keys with ECC_SECG_P256K1
         can be used only to sign and verify messages. KMS keys with ML-DSA key pairs can be used to 
         sign and verify messages. KMS keys with SM2 key pairs (China Regions only) can be used to 
         either encrypt and decrypt data, sign and verify messages, or derive shared secrets (you must 
         choose one key usage type). For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see Asymmetric KMS 
         keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      HMAC KMS key
         To create an HMAC KMS key, set the KeySpec parameter to a key spec value for HMAC KMS 
         keys. Then set the KeyUsage parameter to GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC. You must set the key 
         usage even though GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC is the only valid key usage value for HMAC KMS 
         keys. You can't change these properties after the KMS key is created.
         HMAC KMS keys are symmetric keys that never leave AWS KMS unencrypted. You can use HMAC 
         keys to generate (GenerateMac) and verify (VerifyMac) HMAC codes for messages up to 4096 
         bytes.
      Multi-Region primary keys, Imported key material
         To create a multi-Region primary key in the local AWS Region, use the MultiRegion parameter 
         with a value of True. To create a multi-Region replica key, that is, a KMS key with the same 
         key ID and key material as a primary key, but in a diﬀerent AWS Region, use the ReplicateKey
         operation. To change a replica key to a primary key, and its primary key to a replica key, use the
         UpdatePrimaryRegion operation.
      CreateKey                                                              API Version 2014-11-01 47
      AWS Key Management Service                                                       API Reference
         You can create multi-Region KMS keys for all supported KMS key types: symmetric encryption 
         KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric encryption KMS keys, and asymmetric signing KMS 
         keys. You can also create multi-Region keys with imported key material. However, you can't 
         create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.
         This operation supports multi-Region keys, an AWS KMS feature that lets you create multiple 
         interoperable KMS keys in diﬀerent AWS Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key 
         ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one 
         AWS Region and decrypt it in a diﬀerent AWS Region without re-encrypting the data or making 
         a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Multi-Region keys in 
         AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
         To import your own key material into a KMS key, begin by creating a KMS key with no key 
         material. To do this, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL. Next, 
         use GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import token. Use the wrapping 
         public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to 
         import the key material. For step-by-step instructions, see Importing Key Material in the   AWS 
         Key Management Service Developer Guide .
         You can import key material into KMS keys of all supported KMS key types: symmetric 
         encryption KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric encryption KMS keys, and asymmetric 
         signing KMS keys. You can also create multi-Region keys with imported key material. However, 
         you can't import key material into a KMS key in a custom key store.
         To create a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, use the Origin parameter 
         of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL and the MultiRegion parameter with a value of
         True. To create replicas of the multi-Region primary key, use the ReplicateKey operation. For 
         instructions, see Importing key material step 1. For more information about multi-Region keys, 
         see Multi-Region keys in AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Custom key store
         A custom key store lets you protect your AWS resources using keys in a backing key store that 
         you own and manage. When you request a cryptographic operation with a KMS key in a custom 
         key store, the operation is performed in the backing key store using its cryptographic keys.
         AWS KMS supports AWS CloudHSM key stores backed by an AWS CloudHSM cluster and
         external key stores backed by an external key manager outside of AWS. When you create a 
         KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS generates an encryption key in the AWS 
      CreateKey                                                                API Version 2014-11-01 48
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     API Reference
         CloudHSM cluster and associates it with the KMS key. When you create a KMS key in an external 
         key store, you specify an existing encryption key in the external key manager.
              Note
              Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating a KMS key in an 
              external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation.
         Before you create a KMS key in a custom key store, the ConnectionState of the key store 
         must be CONNECTED. To connect the custom key store, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore
         operation. To ﬁnd the ConnectionState, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
         To create a KMS key in a custom key store, use the CustomKeyStoreId. Use the default
         KeySpec value, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, and the default KeyUsage value, ENCRYPT_DECRYPT
         to create a symmetric encryption key. No other key type is supported in a custom key store.
         To create a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store, use the Origin parameter with a value of
         AWS_CLOUDHSM. The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must 
         have at least two active HSMs in diﬀerent Availability Zones in the AWS Region.
         To create a KMS key in an external key store, use the Origin parameter with a value of
         EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE and an XksKeyId parameter that identiﬁes an existing external key.
              Note
              Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating a KMS key in an 
              external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot use this operation to create a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS 
      account.
      Required permissions: kms:CreateKey (IAM policy). To use the Tags parameter, kms:TagResource
      (IAM policy). For examples and information about related permissions, see Allow a user to create 
      KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                  API Reference
         When you create a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS generates a non-
         exportable 256-bit symmetric key in its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster and associates it with 
         the KMS key. When you create a KMS key in an external key store, you must use the XksKeyId
         parameter to specify an external key that serves as key material for the KMS key.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
         Required: No
      Description
         A description of the KMS key. Use a description that helps you decide whether the KMS key is 
         appropriate for a task. The default value is an empty string (no description).
              Important
              Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
              displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
         To set or change the description after the key is created, use UpdateKeyDescription.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 8192.
         Required: No
      KeySpec
         Speciﬁes the type of KMS key to create. The default value, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, creates 
         a KMS key with a 256-bit AES-GCM key that is used for encryption and decryption, except 
         in China Regions, where it creates a 128-bit symmetric key that uses SM4 encryption. For 
         a detailed description of all supported key specs, see Key spec reference in the   AWS Key 
         Management Service Developer Guide .
         The KeySpec determines whether the KMS key contains a symmetric key or an asymmetric 
         key pair. It also determines the algorithms that the KMS key supports. You can't change 
         the KeySpec after the KMS key is created. To further restrict the algorithms that can

      KeyUsage
         Determines the cryptographic operations for which you can use the KMS key. The default 
         value is ENCRYPT_DECRYPT. This parameter is optional when you are creating a symmetric 
         encryption KMS key; otherwise, it is required. You can't change the KeyUsage value after the 
         KMS key is created.
         Select only one valid value.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      MultiRegion
         Creates a multi-Region primary key that you can replicate into other AWS Regions. You cannot 
         change this value after you create the KMS key.
         For a multi-Region key, set this parameter to True. For a single-Region KMS key, omit this 
         parameter or set it to False. The default value is False.
         This operation supports multi-Region keys, an AWS KMS feature that lets you create multiple 
         interoperable KMS keys in diﬀerent AWS Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key 
         ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one 
         AWS Region and decrypt it in a diﬀerent AWS Region without re-encrypting the data or making 
         a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Multi-Region keys in 
         AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
         This value creates a primary key, not a replica. To create a replica key, use the ReplicateKey
         operation.
         You can create a symmetric or asymmetric multi-Region key, and you can create a multi-Region 
         key with imported key material. However, you cannot create a multi-Region key in a custom key 
         store.
         Type: Boolean
         Required: No
      Origin
         The source of the key material for the KMS key. You cannot change the origin after you create 
         the KMS key. The default is AWS_KMS, which means that AWS KMS creates the key material.
         To create a KMS key with no key material (for imported key material), set this value to
         EXTERNAL. For more information about importing key material into AWS KMS, see Importing 
         Key Material in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The EXTERNAL origin value 
         is valid only for symmetric KMS keys.
         To create a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store and create its key material in the 
         associated AWS CloudHSM cluster, set this value to AWS_CLOUDHSM. You must also use the
         CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify the AWS CloudHSM key store. The KeySpec value 
         must be SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT.
      Request Parameters                                                        API Version 2014-11-01 55

         To create a KMS key in an external key store, set this value to EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE. You 
         must also use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify the external key store and the
         XksKeyId parameter to identify the associated external key. The KeySpec value must be
         SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT.
         Type: String
         Valid Values: AWS_KMS | EXTERNAL | AWS_CLOUDHSM | EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE
         Required: No
      Policy
         The key policy to attach to the KMS key.
         If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:
         •
           The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a subsequent PutKeyPolicy request 
           on the KMS key. This reduces the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more 
           information, see Default key policy in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. (To 
           omit this condition, set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true.)
         • Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the 
           key policy must exist and be visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal, you 
           might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because 
           the new principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS. For more information, 
           see Changes that I make are not always immediately visible in the  AWS Identity and Access 
           Management User Guide.
              Note
              If either of the required Resource or Action elements are missing from a key 
              policy statement, the policy statement has no eﬀect. When a key policy statement is 
              missing one of these elements, the AWS KMS console correctly reports an error, but 
              the CreateKey and PutKeyPolicy API requests succeed, even though the policy 
              statement is ineﬀective.
              For more information on required key policy elements, see Elements in a key policy in 
              the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
         If you do not provide a key policy, AWS KMS attaches a default key policy to the KMS key. For 
         more information, see Default key policy in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      Tags
         Assigns one or more tags to the KMS key. Use this parameter to tag the KMS key when it is 
         created. To tag an existing KMS key, use the TagResource operation.
              Important
              Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
              displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
              Note
              Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For 
              details, see ABAC for AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
         To use this parameter, you must have kms:TagResource permission in an IAM policy.
         Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and the tag value are required, 
         but the tag value can be an empty (null) string. You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS 
         key with the same tag key. If you specify an existing tag key with a diﬀerent tag value, AWS 
         KMS replaces the current tag value with the speciﬁed one.
      Request Parameters                                                   API Version 2014-11-01 57

         When you add tags to an AWS resource, AWS generates a cost allocation report with usage and 
         costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For details, see
         Tags in AWS KMS.
         Type: Array of Tag objects
         Required: No
      XksKeyId
         Identiﬁes the external key that serves as key material for the KMS key in an external key store. 
         Specify the ID that the external key store proxy uses to refer to the external key. For help, see 
         the documentation for your external key store proxy.
         This parameter is required for a KMS key with an Origin value of EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE. It is 
         not valid for KMS keys with any other Origin value.
         The external key must be an existing 256-bit AES symmetric encryption key hosted outside 
         of AWS in an external key manager associated with the external key store speciﬁed by the
         CustomKeyStoreId parameter. This key must be enabled and conﬁgured to perform 
         encryption and decryption. Each KMS key in an external key store must use a diﬀerent external 
         key. For details, see Requirements for a KMS key in an external key store in the  AWS Key 
         Management Service Developer Guide.
         Each KMS key in an external key store is associated two backing keys. One is key material that 
         AWS KMS generates. The other is the external key speciﬁed by this parameter. When you use 
         the KMS key in an external key store to encrypt data, the encryption operation is performed 
         ﬁrst by AWS KMS using the AWS KMS key material, and then by the external key manager 
         using the speciﬁed external key, a process known as double encryption. For details, see Double 
         encryption in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      Decrypt
      Decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted by a KMS key using any of the following operations:
      • Encrypt
      • GenerateDataKey
      • GenerateDataKeyPair
      • GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
      • GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext
      You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted under a symmetric encryption 
      KMS key or an asymmetric encryption KMS key. When the KMS key is asymmetric, you must specify 
      the KMS key and the encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information 
      about asymmetric KMS keys, see Asymmetric KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service 
      Developer Guide.
      The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of AWS KMS by the 
      public key in an AWS KMS asymmetric KMS key. However, it cannot decrypt symmetric ciphertext 
      produced by other libraries, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. 
      These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS.
      If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key, the KeyId parameter 
      is optional. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric 
      ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized 
      users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key 
      ID. However, specifying the KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use 
      the KeyId parameter to specify a KMS key, AWS KMS only uses the KMS key you specify. If the 
      ciphertext was encrypted under a diﬀerent KMS key, the Decrypt operation fails. This practice 
      ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.
      Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the Decrypt operation on 
      a particular KMS key, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an IAM policy 
      that gives the user Decrypt permission on all KMS keys. This user could decrypt ciphertext that 
      was encrypted by KMS keys in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account KMS key 
      permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for Decrypt permissions, limit the user to particular KMS 
      keys or particular trusted accounts. For details, see Best practices for IAM policies in the  AWS Key 
      Management Service Developer Guide.

      Decrypt also supports AWS Nitro Enclaves, which provide an isolated compute environment in 
      Amazon EC2. To call Decrypt for a Nitro enclave, use the AWS Nitro Enclaves SDK or any AWS 
      SDK. Use the Recipient parameter to provide the attestation document for the enclave. Instead 
      of the plaintext data, the response includes the plaintext data encrypted with the public key from 
      the attestation document (CiphertextForRecipient). For information about the interaction 
      between AWS KMS and AWS Nitro Enclaves, see How AWS Nitro Enclaves uses AWS KMS in the 
      AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Yes. If you use the KeyId parameter to identify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS 
      account, specify the key ARN or the alias ARN of the KMS key.

      The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
           Note
           In the following list, the required parameters are described ﬁrst.
      CiphertextBlob
         Ciphertext to be decrypted. The blob includes metadata.
         Type: Base64-encoded binary data object
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 6144.
         Required: Yes
      DryRun
         Checks if your request will succeed. DryRun is an optional parameter.
         To learn more about how to use this parameter, see Testing your permissions in the  AWS Key 
         Management Service Developer Guide.
         Type: Boolean
         Required: No
      EncryptionAlgorithm
         Speciﬁes the encryption algorithm that will be used to decrypt the ciphertext. Specify the same 
         algorithm that was used to encrypt the data. If you specify a diﬀerent algorithm, the Decrypt
         operation fails.
         This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS 
         key. The default value, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, represents the only supported algorithm that is 
         valid for symmetric encryption KMS keys.
      Request Parameters                                                        API Version 2014-11-01 68

         Type: String
         Valid Values: SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT | RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1 | RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 | 
         SM2PKE
         Required: No
      EncryptionContext
         Speciﬁes the encryption context to use when decrypting the data. An encryption context is 
         valid only for cryptographic operations with a symmetric encryption KMS key. The standard 
         asymmetric encryption algorithms and HMAC algorithms that AWS KMS uses do not support an 
         encryption context.
         An encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represent additional 
         authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the 
         same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption 
         context is supported only on operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys. On operations 
         with symmetric encryption KMS keys, an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly 
         recommended.
         For more information, see Encryption context in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer 
         Guide.
         Type: String to string map
         Required: No
      GrantTokens
         A list of grant tokens.
         Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes from a new grant that has 
         not yet achieved eventual consistency. For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant 
         token in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      KeyId
         Speciﬁes the KMS key that AWS KMS uses to decrypt the ciphertext.
         Enter a key ID of the KMS key that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. If you identify a diﬀerent 
         KMS key, the Decrypt operation throws an IncorrectKeyException.
         This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS 
         key. If you used a symmetric encryption KMS key, AWS KMS can get the KMS key from metadata 
         that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, it is always recommended as a best 
         practice. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.
         To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias 
         name, preﬁx it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use 
         the key ARN or alias ARN.
         For example:
         •
           Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •
           Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-
           east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •
           Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias
         •
           Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias
         To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or DescribeKey. To get the alias name 
         and alias ARN, use ListAliases.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.
         Required: No
      Recipient
         A signed attestation document from an AWS Nitro enclave and the encryption algorithm to use 
         with the enclave's public key. The only valid encryption algorithm is RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256.
         This parameter only supports attestation documents for AWS Nitro Enclaves. To include this 
         parameter, use the AWS Nitro Enclaves SDK or any AWS SDK.
      Request Parameters                                                      API Version 2014-11-01 70

         When you use this parameter, instead of returning the plaintext data, AWS KMS encrypts 
         the plaintext data with the public key in the attestation document, and returns the resulting 
         ciphertext in the CiphertextForRecipient ﬁeld in the response. This ciphertext can be 
         decrypted only with the private key in the enclave. The Plaintext ﬁeld in the response is null 
         or empty.

      DeleteAlias
      Deletes the speciﬁed alias.
           Note
           Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For 
           details, see ABAC for AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Because an alias is not a property of a KMS key, you can delete and change the aliases of a KMS key 
      without aﬀecting the KMS key. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey
      operation. To get the aliases of all KMS keys, use the ListAliases operation.
      Each KMS key can have multiple aliases. To change the alias of a KMS key, use DeleteAlias to delete 
      the current alias and CreateAlias to create a new alias. To associate an existing alias with a diﬀerent 
      KMS key, call UpdateAlias.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a diﬀerent AWS account.
      Required permissions
      • kms:DeleteAlias on the alias (IAM policy).
      • kms:DeleteAlias on the KMS key (key policy).

      DeleteCustomKeyStore
      Deletes a custom key store. This operation does not aﬀect any backing elements of the custom 
      key store. It does not delete the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with an AWS CloudHSM 
      key store, or aﬀect any users or keys in the cluster. For an external key store, it does not aﬀect the 
      external key store proxy, external key manager, or any external keys.
      This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in AWS KMS, which combines the 
      convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a key store 
      that you own and manage.
      The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any KMS keys. Before deleting the key store, 
      verify that you will never need to use any of the KMS keys in the key store for any cryptographic 
      operations. Then, use ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the KMS keys from the key store. After 
      the required waiting period expires and all KMS keys are deleted from the custom key store, use
      DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the key store from AWS KMS. Then, you can delete the 
      custom key store.
      For keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store, the ScheduleKeyDeletion operation makes a best 
      eﬀort to delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually
      delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. AWS KMS never creates, 
      manages, or deletes cryptographic keys in the external key manager associated with an external 
      key store. You must manage them using your external key manager tools.
      Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation 
      to disconnect the custom key store from its backing key store. While the key store is disconnected, 
      you cannot create or use the KMS keys in the key store. But, you do not need to delete KMS keys 
      and you can reconnect a disconnected custom key store at any time.
      If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a diﬀerent 
      AWS account.

      DeleteImportedKeyMaterial
      Deletes key material that was previously imported. This operation makes the speciﬁed KMS key 
      temporarily unusable. To restore the usability of the KMS key, reimport the same key material. For 
      more information about importing key material into AWS KMS, see Importing Key Material in the 
      AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      When the speciﬁed KMS key is in the PendingDeletion state, this operation does not change the 
      KMS key's state. Otherwise, it changes the KMS key's state to PendingImport.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS 
      account.

      DeriveSharedSecret
      Derives a shared secret using a key agreement algorithm.
          Note
          You must use an asymmetric NIST-recommended elliptic curve (ECC) or SM2 (China Regions 
          only) KMS key pair with a KeyUsage value of KEY_AGREEMENT to call DeriveSharedSecret.
      DeriveSharedSecret uses the Elliptic Curve Cryptography Cofactor Diﬃe-Hellman Primitive
      (ECDH) to establish a key agreement between two peers by deriving a shared secret from their 
      elliptic curve public-private key pairs. You can use the raw shared secret that DeriveSharedSecret 
      returns to derive a symmetric key that can encrypt and decrypt data that is sent between the 
      two peers, or that can generate and verify HMACs. AWS KMS recommends that you follow NIST 
      recommendations for key derivation when using the raw shared secret to derive a symmetric key.
      The following workﬂow demonstrates how to establish key agreement over an insecure 
      communication channel using DeriveSharedSecret.
      1.
        Alice calls CreateKey to create an asymmetric KMS key pair with a KeyUsage value of
        KEY_AGREEMENT.
        The asymmetric KMS key must use a NIST-recommended elliptic curve (ECC) or SM2 (China 
        Regions only) key spec.
      2. Bob creates an elliptic curve key pair.
        Bob can call CreateKey to create an asymmetric KMS key pair or generate a key pair outside of 
        AWS KMS. Bob's key pair must use the same NIST-recommended elliptic curve (ECC) or SM2 
        (China Regions ony) curve as Alice.
      3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys through an insecure communication channel (like the 
        internet).
        Use GetPublicKey to download the public key of your asymmetric KMS key pair.
      DeriveSharedSecret                                                API Version 2014-11-01 91
      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
              Note
              AWS KMS strongly recommends verifying that the public key you receive came from the 
              expected party before using it to derive a shared secret.
      4. Alice calls DeriveSharedSecret.
         AWS KMS uses the private key from the KMS key pair generated in Step 1, Bob's public key, and 
         the Elliptic Curve Cryptography Cofactor Diﬃe-Hellman Primitive to derive the shared secret. 
         The private key in your KMS key pair never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. DeriveSharedSecret 
         returns the raw shared secret.
      5. Bob uses the Elliptic Curve Cryptography Cofactor Diﬃe-Hellman Primitive to calculate the 
         same raw secret using his private key and Alice's public key.
      To derive a shared secret you must provide a key agreement algorithm, the private key of the 
      caller's asymmetric NIST-recommended elliptic curve or SM2 (China Regions only) KMS key pair, 
      and the public key from your peer's NIST-recommended elliptic curve or SM2 (China Regions only) 
      key pair. The public key can be from another asymmetric KMS key pair or from a key pair generated 
      outside of AWS KMS, but both key pairs must be on the same elliptic curve.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, 
      specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.
      Required permissions: kms:DeriveSharedSecret (key policy)

         To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias 
         name, preﬁx it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use 
         the key ARN or alias ARN.
         For example:
         •
           Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •

         To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or DescribeKey. To get the alias name 
         and alias ARN, use ListAliases.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.
         Required: Yes
      PublicKey
         Speciﬁes the public key in your peer's NIST-recommended elliptic curve (ECC) or SM2 (China 
         Regions only) key pair.
         The public key must be a DER-encoded X.509 public key, also known as
         SubjectPublicKeyInfo (SPKI), as deﬁned in RFC 5280.
         GetPublicKey returns the public key of an asymmetric KMS key pair in the required DER-
         encoded format.
              Note
              If you use AWS CLI version 1, you must provide the DER-encoded X.509 public key in a 
              ﬁle. Otherwise, the AWS CLI Base64-encodes the public key a second time, resulting in a
              ValidationException.
         You can specify the public key as binary data in a ﬁle using ﬁleb (fileb://<path-to-file>)

      Recipient
         A signed attestation document from an AWS Nitro enclave and the encryption algorithm to use 
         with the enclave's public key. The only valid encryption algorithm is RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256.
         This parameter only supports attestation documents for AWS Nitro Enclaves. To call 
         DeriveSharedSecret for an AWS Nitro Enclaves, use the AWS Nitro Enclaves SDK to generate the 
         attestation document and then use the Recipient parameter from any AWS SDK to provide the 
         attestation document for the enclave.
         When you use this parameter, instead of returning a plaintext copy of the shared secret, 
         AWS KMS encrypts the plaintext shared secret under the public key in the attestation

      DependencyTimeoutException
         The system timed out while trying to fulﬁll the request. You can retry the request.
         HTTP Status Code: 500
      DisabledException
         The request was rejected because the speciﬁed KMS key is not enabled.
         HTTP Status Code: 400
      DryRunOperationException
         The request was rejected because the DryRun parameter was speciﬁed.
         HTTP Status Code: 400
      InvalidGrantTokenException
         The request was rejected because the speciﬁed grant token is not valid.
         HTTP Status Code: 400
      InvalidKeyUsageException
         The request was rejected for one of the following reasons:
         •
           The KeyUsage value of the KMS key is incompatible with the API operation.
         • The encryption algorithm or signing algorithm speciﬁed for the operation is incompatible 
           with the type of key material in the KMS key (KeySpec).
         For encrypting, decrypting, re-encrypting, and generating data keys, the KeyUsage must be
         ENCRYPT_DECRYPT. For signing and verifying messages, the KeyUsage must be SIGN_VERIFY. 
         For generating and verifying message authentication codes (MACs), the KeyUsage must 
         be GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC. For deriving key agreement secrets, the KeyUsage must be
         KEY_AGREEMENT. To ﬁnd the KeyUsage of a KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
         To ﬁnd the encryption or signing algorithms supported for a particular KMS key, use the
         DescribeKey operation.

      DescribeCustomKeyStores
      Gets information about custom key stores in the account and Region.
      This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in AWS KMS, which combines the 
      convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a key store 
      that you own and manage.
      By default, this operation returns information about all custom key stores in the account 
      and Region. To get only information about a particular custom key store, use either the
      CustomKeyStoreName or CustomKeyStoreId parameter (but not both).
      To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its AWS CloudHSM cluster or 
      external key store proxy, use the ConnectionState element in the response. If an attempt 
      to connect the custom key store failed, the ConnectionState value is FAILED and the
      ConnectionErrorCode element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help 
      interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry.
      Custom key stores have a DISCONNECTED connection state if the key store has never been 
      connected or you used the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. Otherwise, 
      the connection state is CONNECTED. If your custom key store connection state is CONNECTED but 
      you are having trouble using it, verify that the backing store is active and available. For an AWS 
      CloudHSM key store, verify that the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster is active and contains the 
      minimum number of HSMs required for the operation, if any. For an external key store, verify that 
      the external key store proxy and its associated external key manager are reachable and enabled.
      For help repairing your AWS CloudHSM key store, see the Troubleshooting AWS CloudHSM key 
      stores. For help repairing your external key store, see the Troubleshooting external key stores. Both 
      topics are in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a diﬀerent 
      AWS account.

      DescribeKey
      Provides detailed information about a KMS key. You can run DescribeKey on a customer 
      managed key or an AWS managed key.
      This detailed information includes the key ARN, creation date (and deletion date, if applicable), 
      the key state, and the origin and expiration date (if any) of the key material. It includes ﬁelds, like
      KeySpec, that help you distinguish diﬀerent types of KMS keys. It also displays the key usage 
      (encryption, signing, or generating and verifying MACs) and the algorithms that the KMS key 
      supports.
      For multi-Region keys, DescribeKey displays the primary key and all related replica keys. For KMS 
      keys in AWS CloudHSM key stores, it includes information about the key store, such as the key store 
      ID and the AWS CloudHSM cluster ID. For KMS keys in external key stores, it includes the custom 
      key store ID and the ID of the external key.
      DescribeKey does not return the following information:
      • Aliases associated with the KMS key. To get this information, use ListAliases.
      • Whether automatic key rotation is enabled on the KMS key. To get this information, use
        GetKeyRotationStatus. Also, some key states prevent a KMS key from being automatically 
        rotated. For details, see How key rotation works in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer 
        Guide.
      • Tags on the KMS key. To get this information, use ListResourceTags.
      • Key policies and grants on the KMS key. To get this information, use GetKeyPolicy and ListGrants.
      In general, DescribeKey is a non-mutating operation. It returns data about KMS keys, but doesn't 
      change them. However, AWS services use DescribeKey to create AWS managed keys from a
      predeﬁned AWS alias with no key ID.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, 
      specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.
      Required permissions: kms:DescribeKey (key policy)

      Request Parameters
      For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see Common Parameters.
      The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
           Note
           In the following list, the required parameters are described ﬁrst.
      KeyId
         Describes the speciﬁed KMS key.
         If you specify a predeﬁned AWS alias (an AWS alias with no key ID), AWS KMS associates the 
         alias with an AWS managed key and returns its KeyId and Arn in the response.
         To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias 
         name, preﬁx it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use 
         the key ARN or alias ARN.

      DisableKeyRotation
      Disables automatic rotation of the key material of the speciﬁed symmetric encryption KMS key.
      Automatic key rotation is supported only on symmetric encryption KMS keys. You cannot enable 
      automatic rotation of asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, KMS keys with imported key 
      material, or KMS keys in a custom key store. To enable or disable automatic rotation of a set of 
      related multi-Region keys, set the property on the primary key.
      You can enable (EnableKeyRotation) and disable automatic rotation of the key material in customer 
      managed KMS keys. Key material rotation of AWS managed KMS keys is not conﬁgurable. AWS 
      KMS always rotates the key material for every year. Rotation of AWS owned KMS keys varies.
           Note
           In May 2022, AWS KMS changed the rotation schedule for AWS managed keys from every 
           three years to every year. For details, see EnableKeyRotation.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS 
      account.

      DisconnectCustomKeyStore
      Disconnects the custom key store from its backing key store. This operation disconnects an AWS 
      CloudHSM key store from its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster or disconnects an external key 
      store from the external key store proxy that communicates with your external key manager.
      This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in AWS KMS, which combines the 
      convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a key store 
      that you own and manage.
      While a custom key store is disconnected, you can manage the custom key store and its KMS keys, 
      but you cannot create or use its KMS keys. You can reconnect the custom key store at any time.
           Note
           While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS keys in the custom 
           key store or to use existing KMS keys in cryptographic operations will fail. This action can 
           prevent users from storing and accessing sensitive data.
      When you disconnect a custom key store, its ConnectionState changes to Disconnected. To 
      ﬁnd the connection state of a custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. To 
      reconnect a custom key store, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation.
      If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a diﬀerent 
      AWS account.

      EnableKeyRotation
      Enables automatic rotation of the key material of the speciﬁed symmetric encryption KMS key.
      By default, when you enable automatic rotation of a customer managed KMS key, AWS 
      KMS rotates the key material of the KMS key one year (approximately 365 days) from the 
      enable date and every year thereafter. You can use the optional RotationPeriodInDays
      parameter to specify a custom rotation period when you enable key rotation, or you can use
      RotationPeriodInDays to modify the rotation period of a key that you previously enabled 
      automatic key rotation on.
      You can monitor rotation of the key material for your KMS keys in AWS CloudTrail and Amazon 
      CloudWatch. To disable rotation of the key material in a customer managed KMS key, use the
      DisableKeyRotation operation. You can use the GetKeyRotationStatus operation to identify any in 
      progress rotations. You can use the ListKeyRotations operation to view the details of completed 
      rotations.
      Automatic key rotation is supported only on symmetric encryption KMS keys. You cannot enable 
      automatic rotation of asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, KMS keys with imported key 
      material, or KMS keys in a custom key store. To enable or disable automatic rotation of a set of 
      related multi-Region keys, set the property on the primary key.
      You cannot enable or disable automatic rotation of AWS managed KMS keys. AWS KMS always 
      rotates the key material of AWS managed keys every year. Rotation of AWS owned KMS keys is 
      managed by the AWS service that owns the key.
          Note
          In May 2022, AWS KMS changed the rotation schedule for AWS managed keys from every 
          three years (approximately 1,095 days) to every year (approximately 365 days).
          New AWS managed keys are automatically rotated one year after they are created, and 
          approximately every year thereafter.
          Existing AWS managed keys are automatically rotated one year after their most recent 
          rotation, and every year thereafter.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      Encrypt
      Encrypts plaintext of up to 4,096 bytes using a KMS key. You can use a symmetric or asymmetric 
      KMS key with a KeyUsage of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.
      You can use this operation to encrypt small amounts of arbitrary data, such as a personal identiﬁer 
      or database password, or other sensitive information. You don't need to use the Encrypt
      operation to encrypt a data key. The GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyPair operations return 
      a plaintext data key and an encrypted copy of that data key.
      If you use a symmetric encryption KMS key, you can use an encryption context to add additional 
      security to your encryption operation. If you specify an EncryptionContext when encrypting 
      data, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting 
      the data. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For 
      more information, see Encryption Context in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      If you specify an asymmetric KMS key, you must also specify the encryption algorithm. The 
      algorithm must be compatible with the KMS key spec.
           Important
           When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the 
           KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the 
           same KMS key and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and 
           algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.
           You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with 
           symmetric encryption KMS keys because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext 
           blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The 
           standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include conﬁgurable ﬁelds.
      The maximum size of the data that you can encrypt varies with the type of KMS key and the 
      encryption algorithm that you choose.

      The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
           Note
           In the following list, the required parameters are described ﬁrst.
      KeyId
         Identiﬁes the KMS key to use in the encryption operation. The KMS key must have a KeyUsage
         of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT. To ﬁnd the KeyUsage of a KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
         To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias 
         name, preﬁx it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use 
         the key ARN or alias ARN.
         For example:
         •
           Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •

         algorithm must be compatible with the KMS key that you specify.
         This parameter is required only for asymmetric KMS keys. The default value,
         SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, is the algorithm used for symmetric encryption KMS keys. If you are 
         using an asymmetric KMS key, we recommend RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256.
         The SM2PKE algorithm is only available in China Regions.
         Type: String

              displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
         An encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represent additional 
         authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the 
         same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption 
         context is supported only on operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys. On operations 
         with symmetric encryption KMS keys, an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly 
         recommended.
         For more information, see Encryption context in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer 
         Guide.

      GenerateDataKey
      Returns a unique symmetric data key for use outside of AWS KMS. This operation returns a 
      plaintext copy of the data key and a copy that is encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key 
      that you specify. The bytes in the plaintext key are random; they are not related to the caller or 
      the KMS key. You can use the plaintext key to encrypt your data outside of AWS KMS and store the 
      encrypted data key with the encrypted data.
      To generate a data key, specify the symmetric encryption KMS key that will be used to encrypt the 
      data key. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt data keys. To get the type of your KMS 
      key, use the DescribeKey operation.
      You must also specify the length of the data key. Use either the KeySpec or NumberOfBytes
      parameters (but not both). For 128-bit and 256-bit data keys, use the KeySpec parameter.
      To generate a 128-bit SM4 data key (China Regions only), specify a KeySpec value of AES_128 or a
      NumberOfBytes value of 16. The symmetric encryption key used in China Regions to encrypt your 
      data key is an SM4 encryption key.
      To get only an encrypted copy of the data key, use GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext. 
      To generate an asymmetric data key pair, use the GenerateDataKeyPair or
      GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operation. To get a cryptographically secure random byte 
      string, use GenerateRandom.
      You can use an optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. 
      If you specify an EncryptionContext, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-
      sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt 
      fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in 
      the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      GenerateDataKey also supports AWS Nitro Enclaves, which provide an isolated compute 
      environment in Amazon EC2. To call GenerateDataKey for an AWS Nitro enclave, use the AWS 
      Nitro Enclaves SDK or any AWS SDK. Use the Recipient parameter to provide the attestation 
      document for the enclave. GenerateDataKey returns a copy of the data key encrypted under 
      the speciﬁed KMS key, as usual. But instead of a plaintext copy of the data key, the response 
      includes a copy of the data key encrypted under the public key from the attestation document 
      (CiphertextForRecipient). For information about the interaction between AWS KMS and AWS 
      Nitro Enclaves, see How AWS Nitro Enclaves uses AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service 
      Developer Guide..

      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      How to use your data key
      We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your application. You 
      can write your own code or use a client-side encryption library, such as the AWS Encryption SDK, 
      the Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client, or Amazon S3 client-side encryption to do these tasks 
      for you.
      To encrypt data outside of AWS KMS:
      1.
         Use the GenerateDataKey operation to get a data key.
      2.
         Use the plaintext data key (in the Plaintext ﬁeld of the response) to encrypt your data outside 
         of AWS KMS. Then erase the plaintext data key from memory.
      3.
         Store the encrypted data key (in the CiphertextBlob ﬁeld of the response) with the encrypted 
         data.
      To decrypt data outside of AWS KMS:
      1. Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key. The operation returns a plaintext 
         copy of the data key.
      2. Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data outside of AWS KMS, then erase the plaintext data 
         key from memory.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, 
      specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

         This parameter only supports attestation documents for AWS Nitro Enclaves. To include this 
         parameter, use the AWS Nitro Enclaves SDK or any AWS SDK.
         When you use this parameter, instead of returning the plaintext data key, AWS KMS encrypts 
         the plaintext data key under the public key in the attestation document, and returns the 
         resulting ciphertext in the CiphertextForRecipient ﬁeld in the response. This ciphertext 
         can be decrypted only with the private key in the enclave. The CiphertextBlob ﬁeld in the 
         response contains a copy of the data key encrypted under the KMS key speciﬁed by the KeyId
         parameter. The Plaintext ﬁeld in the response is null or empty.
         For information about the interaction between AWS KMS and AWS Nitro Enclaves, see How 
         AWS Nitro Enclaves uses AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      GenerateDataKeyPair
      Returns a unique asymmetric data key pair for use outside of AWS KMS. This operation returns 
      a plaintext public key, a plaintext private key, and a copy of the private key that is encrypted 
      under the symmetric encryption KMS key you specify. You can use the data key pair to perform 
      asymmetric cryptography and implement digital signatures outside of AWS KMS. The bytes in the 
      keys are random; they are not related to the caller or to the KMS key that is used to encrypt the 
      private key.
      You can use the public key that GenerateDataKeyPair returns to encrypt data or verify a 
      signature outside of AWS KMS. Then, store the encrypted private key with the data. When you 
      are ready to decrypt data or sign a message, you can use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the 
      encrypted private key.
      To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt the 
      private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS key in a custom key 
      store. To get the type and origin of your KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
      Use the KeyPairSpec parameter to choose an RSA or Elliptic Curve (ECC) data key pair. In China 
      Regions, you can also choose an SM2 data key pair. AWS KMS recommends that you use ECC key 
      pairs for signing, and use RSA and SM2 key pairs for either encryption or signing, but not both. 
      However, AWS KMS cannot enforce any restrictions on the use of data key pairs outside of AWS 
      KMS.
      If you are using the data key pair to encrypt data, or for any operation where you don't 
      immediately need a private key, consider using the GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext
      operation. GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext returns a plaintext public key and an 
      encrypted private key, but omits the plaintext private key that you need only to decrypt ciphertext 
      or sign a message. Later, when you need to decrypt the data or sign a message, use the Decrypt
      operation to decrypt the encrypted private key in the data key pair.
      GenerateDataKeyPair returns a unique data key pair for each request. The bytes in the keys are 
      random; they are not related to the caller or the KMS key that is used to encrypt the private key. 
      The public key is a DER-encoded X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as speciﬁed in RFC 5280. The private 
      key is a DER-encoded PKCS8 PrivateKeyInfo, as speciﬁed in RFC 5958.
      GenerateDataKeyPair also supports AWS Nitro Enclaves, which provide an isolated compute 
      environment in Amazon EC2. To call GenerateDataKeyPair for an AWS Nitro enclave, use 
      the AWS Nitro Enclaves SDK or any AWS SDK. Use the Recipient parameter to provide the 
      GenerateDataKeyPair                                                      API Version 2014-11-01 159
      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      attestation document for the enclave. GenerateDataKeyPair returns the public data key 
      and a copy of the private data key encrypted under the speciﬁed KMS key, as usual. But instead 
      of a plaintext copy of the private data key (PrivateKeyPlaintext), the response includes 
      a copy of the private data key encrypted under the public key from the attestation document 
      (CiphertextForRecipient). For information about the interaction between AWS KMS and AWS 
      Nitro Enclaves, see How AWS Nitro Enclaves uses AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service 
      Developer Guide..
      You can use an optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. 
      If you specify an EncryptionContext, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-
      sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt 
      fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in 
      the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, 
      specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

      The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
           Note
           In the following list, the required parameters are described ﬁrst.
      KeyId
         Speciﬁes the symmetric encryption KMS key that encrypts the private key in the data key pair. 
         You cannot specify an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the type 
         and origin of your KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
         To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias 
         name, preﬁx it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use 
         the key ARN or alias ARN.
         For example:
         •
           Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •

         An encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represent additional 
         authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the 
         same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption 
         context is supported only on operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys. On operations 
         with symmetric encryption KMS keys, an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly 
         recommended.
         For more information, see Encryption context in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer 
         Guide.

      GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext
      Returns a unique asymmetric data key pair for use outside of AWS KMS. This operation returns a 
      plaintext public key and a copy of the private key that is encrypted under the symmetric encryption 
      KMS key you specify. Unlike GenerateDataKeyPair, this operation does not return a plaintext 
      private key. The bytes in the keys are random; they are not related to the caller or to the KMS key 
      that is used to encrypt the private key.
      You can use the public key that GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext returns to encrypt 
      data or verify a signature outside of AWS KMS. Then, store the encrypted private key with the 
      data. When you are ready to decrypt data or sign a message, you can use the Decrypt operation to 
      decrypt the encrypted private key.
      To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt the 
      private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS key in a custom key 
      store. To get the type and origin of your KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
      Use the KeyPairSpec parameter to choose an RSA or Elliptic Curve (ECC) data key pair. In China 
      Regions, you can also choose an SM2 data key pair. AWS KMS recommends that you use ECC key 
      pairs for signing, and use RSA and SM2 key pairs for either encryption or signing, but not both. 
      However, AWS KMS cannot enforce any restrictions on the use of data key pairs outside of AWS 
      KMS.
      GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext returns a unique data key pair for each request. The 
      bytes in the key are not related to the caller or KMS key that is used to encrypt the private key. The 
      public key is a DER-encoded X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as speciﬁed in RFC 5280.
      You can use an optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. 
      If you specify an EncryptionContext, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-
      sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt 
      fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in 
      the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, 
      specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                    API Reference
         To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias 
         name, preﬁx it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use 
         the key ARN or alias ARN.
         For example:
         •
           Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •

         Required: Yes
      KeyPairSpec
         Determines the type of data key pair that is generated.
         The AWS KMS rule that restricts the use of asymmetric RSA and SM2 KMS keys to encrypt and 
         decrypt or to sign and verify (but not both), the rule that permits you to use ECC KMS keys only 
         to sign and verify, and the rule that permits you to use ML-DSA key pairs to sign and verify only 
         are not eﬀective on data key pairs, which are used outside of AWS KMS. The SM2 key spec is 
         only available in China Regions.

      EncryptionContext
         Speciﬁes the encryption context that will be used when encrypting the private key in the data 
         key pair.
              Important
              Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
              displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
         An encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represent additional 
         authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the 
         same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption 
         context is supported only on operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys. On operations 
         with symmetric encryption KMS keys, an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly 
         recommended.
         For more information, see Encryption context in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer 
         Guide.

      InvalidKeyUsageException
         The request was rejected for one of the following reasons:
         •
           The KeyUsage value of the KMS key is incompatible with the API operation.
         • The encryption algorithm or signing algorithm speciﬁed for the operation is incompatible 
           with the type of key material in the KMS key (KeySpec).
         For encrypting, decrypting, re-encrypting, and generating data keys, the KeyUsage must be
         ENCRYPT_DECRYPT. For signing and verifying messages, the KeyUsage must be SIGN_VERIFY. 
         For generating and verifying message authentication codes (MACs), the KeyUsage must 
         be GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC. For deriving key agreement secrets, the KeyUsage must be
         KEY_AGREEMENT. To ﬁnd the KeyUsage of a KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
      Returns a unique symmetric data key for use outside of AWS KMS. This operation returns a data key 
      that is encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key that you specify. The bytes in the key are 
      random; they are not related to the caller or to the KMS key.
      GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext is identical to the GenerateDataKey operation except that 
      it does not return a plaintext copy of the data key.
      This operation is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not immediately. 
      When you need to encrypt the data, you call the Decrypt operation on the encrypted copy of the 
      key.
      It's also useful in distributed systems with diﬀerent levels of trust. For example, you might store 
      encrypted data in containers. One component of your system creates new containers and stores 
      an encrypted data key with each container. Then, a diﬀerent component puts the data into the 
      containers. That component ﬁrst decrypts the data key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, 
      puts the encrypted data into the container, and then destroys the plaintext data key. In this system, 
      the component that creates the containers never sees the plaintext data key.
      To request an asymmetric data key pair, use the GenerateDataKeyPair or
      GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operations.
      To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric encryption KMS key that is used to encrypt 
      the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a key in a custom key store to generate a 
      data key. To get the type of your KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
      You must also specify the length of the data key. Use either the KeySpec or NumberOfBytes
      parameters (but not both). For 128-bit and 256-bit data keys, use the KeySpec parameter.
      To generate an SM4 data key (China Regions only), specify a KeySpec value of AES_128 or
      NumberOfBytes value of 16. The symmetric encryption key used in China Regions to encrypt your 
      data key is an SM4 encryption key.
      If the operation succeeds, you will ﬁnd the encrypted copy of the data key in the CiphertextBlob
      ﬁeld.
      You can use an optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. 
      If you specify an EncryptionContext, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-

      sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt 
      fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in 
      the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, 
      specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

      The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
           Note
           In the following list, the required parameters are described ﬁrst.
      KeyId
         Speciﬁes the symmetric encryption KMS key that encrypts the data key. You cannot specify an 
         asymmetric KMS key or a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your KMS 
         key, use the DescribeKey operation.
         To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias 
         name, preﬁx it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use 
         the key ARN or alias ARN.
         For example:
         •
           Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •
           Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-

         •
           Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias
         •
           Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias
         To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or DescribeKey. To get the alias name 
         and alias ARN, use ListAliases.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.
         Required: Yes
      DryRun
         Checks if your request will succeed. DryRun is an optional parameter.
         To learn more about how to use this parameter, see Testing your permissions in the  AWS Key 
         Management Service Developer Guide.

         Type: Boolean
         Required: No
      EncryptionContext
         Speciﬁes the encryption context that will be used when encrypting the data key.
              Important
              Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
              displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
         An encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represent additional 
         authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the 
         same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption 
         context is supported only on operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys. On operations 
         with symmetric encryption KMS keys, an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly 
         recommended.
         For more information, see Encryption context in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer 
         Guide.
         Type: String to string map
         Required: No
      GrantTokens
         A list of grant tokens.
         Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes from a new grant that has 
         not yet achieved eventual consistency. For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant 
         token in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      GenerateMac
      Generates a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) for a message using an HMAC KMS 
      key and a MAC algorithm that the key supports. HMAC KMS keys and the HMAC algorithms that 
      AWS KMS uses conform to industry standards deﬁned in RFC 2104.
      You can use value that GenerateMac returns in the VerifyMac operation to demonstrate that the 
      original message has not changed. Also, because a secret key is used to create the hash, you can 
      verify that the party that generated the hash has the required secret key. You can also use the raw 
      result to implement HMAC-based algorithms such as key derivation functions. This operation is 
      part of AWS KMS support for HMAC KMS keys. For details, see HMAC keys in AWS KMS in the   AWS 
      Key Management Service Developer Guide .
           Note
           Best practices recommend that you limit the time during which any signing mechanism, 
           including an HMAC, is eﬀective. This deters an attack where the actor uses a signed 
           message to establish validity repeatedly or long after the message is superseded. HMAC 
           tags do not include a timestamp, but you can include a timestamp in the token or message 
           to help you detect when its time to refresh the HMAC.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, 
      specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.
      Required permissions: kms:GenerateMac (key policy)

      GenerateRandom
      Returns a random byte string that is cryptographically secure.
      You must use the NumberOfBytes parameter to specify the length of the random byte string. 
      There is no default value for string length.
      By default, the random byte string is generated in AWS KMS. To generate the byte string in the 
      AWS CloudHSM cluster associated with an AWS CloudHSM key store, use the CustomKeyStoreId
      parameter.
      GenerateRandom also supports AWS Nitro Enclaves, which provide an isolated compute 
      environment in Amazon EC2. To call GenerateRandom for a Nitro enclave, use the AWS Nitro 
      Enclaves SDK or any AWS SDK. Use the Recipient parameter to provide the attestation 
      document for the enclave. Instead of plaintext bytes, the response includes the plaintext bytes 
      encrypted under the public key from the attestation document (CiphertextForRecipient).For 
      information about the interaction between AWS KMS and AWS Nitro Enclaves, see How AWS Nitro 
      Enclaves uses AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      For more information about entropy and random number generation, see Entropy and random 
      number generation in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Not applicable. GenerateRandom does not use any account-speciﬁc resources, 
      such as KMS keys.
      Required permissions: kms:GenerateRandom (IAM policy)

         When you use this parameter, instead of returning plaintext bytes, AWS KMS encrypts the 
         plaintext bytes under the public key in the attestation document, and returns the resulting 
         ciphertext in the CiphertextForRecipient ﬁeld in the response. This ciphertext can be 
         decrypted only with the private key in the enclave. The Plaintext ﬁeld in the response is null 
         or empty.

      GetKeyRotationStatus
      Provides detailed information about the rotation status for a KMS key, including whether
      automatic rotation of the key material is enabled for the speciﬁed KMS key, the rotation period, 
      and the next scheduled rotation date.
      Automatic key rotation is supported only on symmetric encryption KMS keys. You cannot enable 
      automatic rotation of asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, KMS keys with imported key 
      material, or KMS keys in a custom key store. To enable or disable automatic rotation of a set of 
      related multi-Region keys, set the property on the primary key.
      You can enable (EnableKeyRotation) and disable automatic rotation (DisableKeyRotation) of the 
      key material in customer managed KMS keys. Key material rotation of AWS managed KMS keys is 
      not conﬁgurable. AWS KMS always rotates the key material in AWS managed KMS keys every year. 
      The key rotation status for AWS managed KMS keys is always true.
      You can perform on-demand (RotateKeyOnDemand) rotation of the key material in customer 
      managed KMS keys, regardless of whether or not automatic key rotation is enabled. You can use 
      GetKeyRotationStatus to identify the date and time that an in progress on-demand rotation was 
      initiated. You can use ListKeyRotations to view the details of completed rotations.
          Note
          In May 2022, AWS KMS changed the rotation schedule for AWS managed keys from every 
          three years to every year. For details, see EnableKeyRotation.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      • Disabled: The key rotation status does not change when you disable a KMS key. However, while 
        the KMS key is disabled, AWS KMS does not rotate the key material. When you re-enable the 
        KMS key, rotation resumes. If the key material in the re-enabled KMS key hasn't been rotated 
        in one year, AWS KMS rotates it immediately, and every year thereafter. If it's been less than a 
        year since the key material in the re-enabled KMS key was rotated, the KMS key resumes its prior 
        rotation schedule.
      •
        Pending deletion: While a KMS key is pending deletion, its key rotation status is false and AWS 
        KMS does not rotate the key material. If you cancel the deletion, the original key rotation status 
        returns to true.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      GetParametersForImport
      Returns the public key and an import token you need to import or reimport key material for a KMS 
      key.
      By default, KMS keys are created with key material that AWS KMS generates. This operation 
      supports Importing key material, an advanced feature that lets you generate and import the 
      cryptographic key material for a KMS key.
      Before calling GetParametersForImport, use the CreateKey operation with an Origin
      value of EXTERNAL to create a KMS key with no key material. You can import key material for a 
      symmetric encryption KMS key, HMAC KMS key, asymmetric encryption KMS key, or asymmetric 
      signing KMS key. You can also import key material into a multi-Region key of any supported type. 
      However, you can't import key material into a KMS key in a custom key store. You can also use
      GetParametersForImport to get a public key and import token to reimport the original key 
      material into a KMS key whose key material expired or was deleted.
      GetParametersForImport returns the items that you need to import your key material.
      • The public key (or "wrapping key") of an RSA key pair that KMS generates.
        You will use this public key to encrypt ("wrap") your key material while it's in transit to AWS KMS.
      • A import token that ensures that AWS KMS can decrypt your key material and associate it with 
        the correct KMS key.
      The public key and its import token are permanently linked and must be used together. Each 
      public key and import token set is valid for 24 hours. The expiration date and time appear in the
      ParametersValidTo ﬁeld in the GetParametersForImport response. You cannot use an 
      expired public key or import token in an ImportKeyMaterial request. If your key and token expire, 
      send another GetParametersForImport request.
      GetParametersForImport requires the following information:
      • The key ID of the KMS key for which you are importing the key material.
      • The key spec of the public key ("wrapping key") that you will use to encrypt your key material 
        during import.
      • The wrapping algorithm that you will use with the public key to encrypt your key material.
      GetParametersForImport                                                   API Version 2014-11-01 212
      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      You can use the same or a diﬀerent public key spec and wrapping algorithm each time you import 
      or reimport the same key material.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS 
      account.

      KeyId
         The identiﬁer of the KMS key that will be associated with the imported key material. The
         Origin of the KMS key must be EXTERNAL.
         All KMS key types are supported, including multi-Region keys. However, you cannot import key 
         material into a KMS key in a custom key store.
         Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.
         For example:
         •
           Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •

           east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or DescribeKey.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.
         Required: Yes
      WrappingAlgorithm
         The algorithm you will use with the RSA public key (PublicKey) in the response to protect your 
         key material during import. For more information, see Select a wrapping algorithm in the  AWS 
         Key Management Service Developer Guide.
         For RSA_AES wrapping algorithms, you encrypt your key material with an AES key that you 
         generate, then encrypt your AES key with the RSA public key from AWS KMS. For RSAES 
         wrapping algorithms, you encrypt your key material directly with the RSA public key from AWS 
         KMS.
         The wrapping algorithms that you can use depend on the type of key material that you are 
         importing. To import an RSA private key, you must use an RSA_AES wrapping algorithm.
         • RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_256 — Supported for wrapping RSA and ECC key material.
         • RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_1 — Supported for wrapping RSA and ECC key material.
         • RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 — Supported for all types of key material, except RSA key material 
           (private key).

           (private key).
           You cannot use the RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1 wrapping algorithm with the RSA_2048 wrapping 
           key spec to wrap ECC_NIST_P521 key material.
         • RSAES_PKCS1_V1_5 (Deprecated) — As of October 10, 2023, AWS KMS does not support the

     GetPublicKey
     Returns the public key of an asymmetric KMS key. Unlike the private key of a asymmetric KMS 
     key, which never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted, callers with kms:GetPublicKey permission can 
     download the public key of an asymmetric KMS key. You can share the public key to allow others 
     to encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of AWS KMS. For information about asymmetric 
     KMS keys, see Asymmetric KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
     You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key within AWS 
     KMS by calling the Encrypt, ReEncrypt, or Verify operations with the identiﬁer of an asymmetric 
     KMS key. When you use the public key within AWS KMS, you beneﬁt from the authentication, 
     authorization, and logging that are part of every AWS KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of 
     encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These features are not eﬀective outside of AWS KMS.
     To help you use the public key safely outside of AWS KMS, GetPublicKey returns important 
     information about the public key in the response, including:
     •
       KeySpec: The type of key material in the public key, such as RSA_4096 or ECC_NIST_P521.
     • KeyUsage: Whether the key is used for encryption, signing, or deriving a shared secret.
     • EncryptionAlgorithms, KeyAgreementAlgorithms, or SigningAlgorithms: A list of the encryption 
       algorithms, key agreement algorithms, or signing algorithms for the key.
     Although AWS KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is crucial that you 
     use this information to prevent the public key from being used improperly. For example, you can 
     prevent a public signing key from being used encrypt data, or prevent a public key from being used 
     with an encryption algorithm that is not supported by AWS KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as 
     using the wrong signing algorithm in a veriﬁcation operation.
     To verify a signature outside of AWS KMS with an SM2 public key (China Regions only), you must 
     specify the distinguishing ID. By default, AWS KMS uses 1234567812345678 as the distinguishing 
     ID. For more information, see Oﬄine veriﬁcation with SM2 key pairs.
     The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
     states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
     Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, 
     specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

      KeyId
         Identiﬁes the asymmetric KMS key that includes the public key.
         To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias 
         name, preﬁx it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use 
         the key ARN or alias ARN.
         For example:

      ImportKeyMaterial
      Imports or reimports key material into an existing KMS key that was created without key material. 
      You can also use this operation to set or update the expiration model and expiration date of the 
      imported key material.
      By default, AWS KMS creates KMS keys with key material that it generates. You can also generate 
      and import your own key material. For more information about importing key material, see
      Importing key material.
      For asymmetric, HMAC and multi-Region keys, you cannot change the key material after the initial 
      import. You can import multiple key materials into single-Region, symmetric encryption keys and 
      rotate the key material on demand using RotateKeyOnDemand.
      After you import key material, you can reimport the same key material into that KMS key or, if 
      the key supports on-demand rotation, import new key material. You can use the ImportType
      parameter to indicate whether you are importing new key material or re-importing previously 
      imported key material. You might reimport key material to replace key material that expired or key 
      material that you deleted. You might also reimport key material to change the expiration model or 
      expiration date of the key material.
      Each time you import key material into AWS KMS, you can determine whether 
      (ExpirationModel) and when (ValidTo) the key material expires. To change the expiration of 
      your key material, you must import it again, either by calling ImportKeyMaterial or using the
      import features of the AWS KMS console.
      Before you call ImportKeyMaterial, complete these steps:
      •
        Create or identify a KMS key with EXTERNAL origin, which indicates that the KMS key is designed 
        for imported key material.
        To create a new KMS key for imported key material, call the CreateKey operation with an Origin
        value of EXTERNAL. You can create a symmetric encryption KMS key, HMAC KMS key, asymmetric 
        encryption KMS key, asymmetric key agreement key, or asymmetric signing KMS key. You can 
        also import key material into a multi-Region key of any supported type. However, you can't 
        import key material into a KMS key in a custom key store.
      • Call the GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import token set for 
        importing key material.
      • Use the public key in the GetParametersForImport response to encrypt your key material.
      ImportKeyMaterial                                                        API Version 2014-11-01 229
      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      Then, in an ImportKeyMaterial request, you submit your encrypted key material and import 
      token. When calling this operation, you must specify the following values:
      •
        The key ID or key ARN of the KMS key to associate with the imported key material. Its Origin
        must be EXTERNAL and its KeyState must be PendingImport. You cannot perform this 
        operation on a KMS key in a custom key store, or on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account. To get 
        the Origin and KeyState of a KMS key, call DescribeKey.
      • The encrypted key material.
      • The import token that GetParametersForImport returned. You must use a public key and token 
        from the same GetParametersForImport response.
      •
        Whether the key material expires (ExpirationModel) and, if so, when (ValidTo). For help with 
        this choice, see Setting an expiration time in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
        If you set an expiration date, AWS KMS deletes the key material from the KMS key on the 
        speciﬁed date, making the KMS key unusable. To use the KMS key in cryptographic operations 
        again, you must reimport the same key material. However, you can delete and reimport the key 
        material at any time, including before the key material expires. Each time you reimport, you can 
        eliminate or reset the expiration time.
      When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes from PendingImport to
      Enabled, and you can use the KMS key in cryptographic operations. For single-Region, symmetric 
      encryption keys, you will need to import all of the key materials associated with the KMS key to 
      change its state to Enabled. Use the ListKeyRotations operation to list the ID and import state 
      of each key material associated with a KMS key.
      If this operation fails, use the exception to help determine the problem. If the error is related to the 
      key material, the import token, or wrapping key, use GetParametersForImport to get a new public 
      key and import token for the KMS key and repeat the import procedure. For help, see Create a KMS

      Request Parameters
      For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see Common Parameters.
      The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
           Note
           In the following list, the required parameters are described ﬁrst.
      EncryptedKeyMaterial
         The encrypted key material to import. The key material must be encrypted under the public 
         wrapping key that GetParametersForImport returned, using the wrapping algorithm that you 
         speciﬁed in the same GetParametersForImport request.

         Type: Base64-encoded binary data object
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 6144.
         Required: Yes
      ImportToken
         The import token that you received in the response to a previous GetParametersForImport
         request. It must be from the same response that contained the public key that you used to 
         encrypt the key material.
         Type: Base64-encoded binary data object
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 6144.
         Required: Yes
      KeyId
         The identiﬁer of the KMS key that will be associated with the imported key material. 
         This must be the same KMS key speciﬁed in the KeyID parameter of the corresponding
         GetParametersForImport request. The Origin of the KMS key must be EXTERNAL and its
         KeyState must be PendingImport.
         The KMS key can be a symmetric encryption KMS key, HMAC KMS key, asymmetric encryption 
         KMS key, or asymmetric signing KMS key, including a multi-Region key of any supported type. 
         You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a custom key store, or on a KMS key in a 
         diﬀerent AWS account.
         Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.
         For example:
         •
           Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •
           Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-
           east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or DescribeKey.

         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.
         Required: Yes
      ExpirationModel
         Speciﬁes whether the key material expires. The default is KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES. For help 
         with this choice, see Setting an expiration time in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer 
         Guide.
         When the value of ExpirationModel is KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES, you must specify a value 
         for the ValidTo parameter. When value is KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE, you must omit 
         the ValidTo parameter.
         You cannot change the ExpirationModel or ValidTo values for the current import after the 
         request completes. To change either value, you must reimport the key material.
         Type: String
         Valid Values: KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES | KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE
         Required: No
      ImportType
         Indicates whether the key material being imported is previously associated with this KMS 
         key or not. This parameter is optional and only usable with symmetric encryption keys. If no 
         key material has ever been imported into the KMS key, and this parameter is omitted, the 
         parameter defaults to NEW_KEY_MATERIAL. After the ﬁrst key material is imported, if this 
         parameter is omitted then the parameter defaults to EXISTING_KEY_MATERIAL.
         Type: String
         Valid Values: NEW_KEY_MATERIAL | EXISTING_KEY_MATERIAL
         Required: No
      KeyMaterialDescription
         Description for the key material being imported. This parameter is optional and only usable 
         with symmetric encryption keys. If you do not specify a key material description, AWS KMS 
         retains the value you speciﬁed when you last imported the same key material into this KMS key.
      Request Parameters                                                       API Version 2014-11-01 233
      AWS Key Management Service                                                       API Reference
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 256.
         Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9:/_\s.-]+$
         Required: No
      KeyMaterialId
         Identiﬁes the key material being imported. This parameter is optional and only usable with 
         symmetric encryption keys. You cannot specify a key material ID with ImportType set to
         NEW_KEY_MATERIAL. Whenever you import key material into a symmetric encryption key, AWS 
         KMS assigns a unique identiﬁer to the key material based on the KMS key ID and the imported 
         key material. When you re-import key material with a speciﬁed key material ID, AWS KMS:
         • Computes the identiﬁer for the key material
         • Matches the computed identiﬁer against the speciﬁed key material ID
         • Veriﬁes that the key material ID is already associated with the KMS key
         To get the list of key material IDs associated with a KMS key, use ListKeyRotations.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Fixed length of 64.
         Pattern: ^[a-f0-9]+$
         Required: No
      ValidTo
         The date and time when the imported key material expires. This parameter is required when the 
         value of the ExpirationModel parameter is KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES. Otherwise it is not 
         valid.
         The value of this parameter must be a future date and time. The maximum value is 365 days 
         from the request date.
         When the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material from the KMS key. Without 
         its key material, the KMS key is unusable. To use the KMS key in cryptographic operations, you 
         must reimport the same key material.
      Request Parameters                                                       API Version 2014-11-01 234

         meet expectations. For example, it is not the same key material that was previously imported or 
         AWS KMS expected new key material but the key material being imported is already associated 
         with the KMS key.
         HTTP Status Code: 400
      InvalidArnException
         The request was rejected because a speciﬁed ARN, or an ARN in a key policy, is not valid.
         HTTP Status Code: 400
      InvalidCiphertextException
         From the Decrypt or ReEncrypt operation, the request was rejected because the speciﬁed 
         ciphertext, or additional authenticated data incorporated into the ciphertext, such as the 
         encryption context, is corrupted, missing, or otherwise invalid.
         From the ImportKeyMaterial operation, the request was rejected because AWS KMS could not 
         decrypt the encrypted (wrapped) key material.
         HTTP Status Code: 400
      InvalidImportTokenException
         The request was rejected because the provided import token is invalid or is associated with a 
         diﬀerent KMS key.

         This exceptions means one of the following:
         • The key state of the KMS key is not compatible with the operation.
           To ﬁnd the key state, use the DescribeKey operation. For more information about which key 
           states are compatible with each AWS KMS operation, see Key states of AWS KMS keys in the  
           AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide .
         • For cryptographic operations on KMS keys in custom key stores, this exception represents a 
           general failure with many possible causes. To identify the cause, see the error message that 
           accompanies the exception.
         HTTP Status Code: 400
      NotFoundException
         The request was rejected because the speciﬁed entity or resource could not be found.
         HTTP Status Code: 400
      UnsupportedOperationException
         The request was rejected because a speciﬁed parameter is not supported or a speciﬁed resource

      ListAliases
      Gets a list of aliases in the caller's AWS account and region. For more information about aliases, see
      CreateAlias.
      By default, the ListAliases operation returns all aliases in the account and region. To get only 
      the aliases associated with a particular KMS key, use the KeyId parameter.
      The ListAliases response can include aliases that you created and associated with your 
      customer managed keys, and aliases that AWS created and associated with AWS managed keys 
      in your account. You can recognize AWS aliases because their names have the format aws/
      <service-name>, such as aws/dynamodb.
      The response might also include aliases that have no TargetKeyId ﬁeld. These are predeﬁned 
      aliases that AWS has created but has not yet associated with a KMS key. Aliases that AWS creates in 
      your account, including predeﬁned aliases, do not count against your AWS KMS aliases quota.
      Cross-account use: No. ListAliases does not return aliases in other AWS accounts.
      Required permissions: kms:ListAliases (IAM policy)
      For details, see Controlling access to aliases in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      ListGrants
      Gets a list of all grants for the speciﬁed KMS key.
      You must specify the KMS key in all requests. You can ﬁlter the grant list by grant ID or grantee 
      principal.
      For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see Grants in AWS KMS in 
      the   AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . For examples of creating grants in several 
      programming languages, see Use CreateGrant with an AWS SDK or CLI.
           Note
           The GranteePrincipal ﬁeld in the ListGrants response usually contains the user or 
           role designated as the grantee principal in the grant. However, when the grantee principal 
           in the grant is an AWS service, the GranteePrincipal ﬁeld contains the service principal, 
           which might represent several diﬀerent grantee principals.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, specify 
      the key ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.
      Required permissions: kms:ListGrants (key policy)

      ListKeyRotations
      Returns information about the key materials associated with the speciﬁed KMS key. You can use 
      the optional IncludeKeyMaterial parameter to control which key materials are included in the 
      response.
      You must specify the KMS key in all requests. You can reﬁne the key rotations list by limiting the 
      number of rotations returned.
      For detailed information about automatic and on-demand key rotations, see Rotate AWS KMS keys
      in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS 
      account.

      For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see Common Parameters.
      The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
           Note
           In the following list, the required parameters are described ﬁrst.
      KeyId
         Gets the key rotations for the speciﬁed KMS key.
         Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.
         For example:
         •
           Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •

           east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or DescribeKey.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.
         Required: Yes
      IncludeKeyMaterial
         Use this optional parameter to control which key materials associated with this key are listed 
         in the response. The default value of this parameter is ROTATIONS_ONLY. If you omit this 
         parameter, AWS KMS returns information on the key materials created by automatic or on-
         demand key rotation. When you specify a value of ALL_KEY_MATERIAL, AWS KMS adds 
         the ﬁrst key material and any imported key material pending rotation to the response. This 
         parameter can only be used with KMS keys that support automatic or on-demand key rotation.
         Type: String
         Valid Values: ALL_KEY_MATERIAL | ROTATIONS_ONLY

         Required: No
      Limit
         Use this parameter to specify the maximum number of items to return. When this value is 
         present, AWS KMS does not return more than the speciﬁed number of items, but it might return 
         fewer.
         This value is optional. If you include a value, it must be between 1 and 1000, inclusive. If you do 
         not include a value, it defaults to 100.
         Type: Integer
         Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 1000.
         Required: No
      Marker

      ListRetirableGrants
      Returns information about all grants in the AWS account and Region that have the speciﬁed 
      retiring principal.
      You can specify any principal in your AWS account. The grants that are returned include grants for 
      KMS keys in your AWS account and other AWS accounts. You might use this operation to determine 
      which grants you may retire. To retire a grant, use the RetireGrant operation.
      For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see Grants in AWS KMS in 
      the   AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . For examples of creating grants in several 
      programming languages, see Use CreateGrant with an AWS SDK or CLI.
      Cross-account use: You must specify a principal in your AWS account. This operation returns a list 
      of grants where the retiring principal speciﬁed in the ListRetirableGrants request is the same 
      retiring principal on the grant. This can include grants on KMS keys owned by other AWS accounts, 
      but you do not need kms:ListRetirableGrants permission (or any other additional permission) 
      in any AWS account other than your own.
      Required permissions: kms:ListRetirableGrants (IAM policy) in your AWS account.
           Note
           AWS KMS authorizes ListRetirableGrants requests by evaluating the caller account's 
           kms:ListRetirableGrants permissions. The authorized resource in ListRetirableGrants
           calls is the retiring principal speciﬁed in the request. AWS KMS does not evaluate the 
           caller's permissions to verify their access to any KMS keys or grants that might be returned 
           by the ListRetirableGrants call.

           In the following list, the required parameters are described ﬁrst.
      PutKeyPolicy                                                             API Version 2014-11-01 289

      KeyId
         Sets the key policy on the speciﬁed KMS key.
         Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.
         For example:
         •
           Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •
           Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-
           east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or DescribeKey.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.
         Required: Yes
      Policy
         The key policy to attach to the KMS key.
         The key policy must meet the following criteria:
         •
           The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a subsequent PutKeyPolicy request 
           on the KMS key. This reduces the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more 
           information, see Default key policy in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. (To 
           omit this condition, set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true.)
         • Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the 
           key policy must exist and be visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal, you 
           might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because 
           the new principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS. For more information, 
           see Changes that I make are not always immediately visible in the  AWS Identity and Access 
           Management User Guide.
              Note
              If either of the required Resource or Action elements are missing from a key policy 
              statement, the policy statement has no eﬀect. When a key policy statement is missing 
              one of these elements, the AWS KMS console correctly reports an error, but the
              PutKeyPolicy API request succeeds, even though the policy statement is ineﬀective.

              For more information on required key policy elements, see Elements in a key policy in 
              the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
         A key policy document can include only the following characters:
         •
           Printable ASCII characters from the space character (\u0020) through the end of the ASCII 
           character range.
         • Printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through
           \u00FF).
         •
           The tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) special characters
              Note
              If the key policy exceeds the length constraint, AWS KMS returns a
              LimitExceededException.
         For information about key policies, see Key policies in AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management 
         Service Developer Guide.For help writing and formatting a JSON policy document, see the IAM

         Required: Yes
      BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck
         Skips ("bypasses") the key policy lockout safety check. The default value is false.
              Important
              Setting this value to true increases the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. 
              Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.

      ReEncrypt
      Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within AWS KMS. You can use this operation to 
      change the KMS key under which data is encrypted, such as when you manually rotate a KMS key 
      or change the KMS key that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under 
      the same KMS key, such as to change the encryption context of a ciphertext.
      The ReEncrypt operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using a KMS key in an 
      AWS KMS operation, such as Encrypt or GenerateDataKey. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was 
      encrypted by using the public key of an asymmetric KMS key outside of AWS KMS. However, it 
      cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or Amazon 
      S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS 
      KMS.
      When you use the ReEncrypt operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt 
      operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.
      •
        If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key, you must use the SourceKeyId
        parameter to identify the KMS key that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the 
        encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.
      •
        If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key, the SourceKeyId
        parameter is optional. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the 
        symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that 
        authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track 
        of the key ID. However, specifying the source KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. 
        When you use the SourceKeyId parameter to specify a KMS key, AWS KMS uses only the KMS 
        key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a diﬀerent KMS key, the ReEncrypt
        operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.
      •
        To reencrypt the data, you must use the DestinationKeyId parameter to specify the KMS key 
        that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. If the destination KMS key is an asymmetric KMS 
        key, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be 
        compatible with the KMS key.
             Important
             When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the 
             KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the 
      ReEncrypt                                                           API Version 2014-11-01 297
      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
             same KMS key and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and 
             algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.
             You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt 
             with symmetric encryption KMS keys because AWS KMS stores this information in 
             the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with 
             asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include 
             conﬁgurable ﬁelds.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Yes. The source KMS key and destination KMS key can be in diﬀerent AWS 
      accounts. Either or both KMS keys can be in a diﬀerent account than the caller. To specify a KMS 
      key in a diﬀerent account, you must use its key ARN or alias ARN.
      Required permissions:
      • kms:ReEncryptFrom permission on the source KMS key (key policy)
      • kms:ReEncryptTo permission on the destination KMS key (key policy)
      To permit reencryption from or to a KMS key, include the "kms:ReEncrypt*" permission in your
      key policy. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use the console to 
      create a KMS key. But you must include it manually when you create a KMS key programmatically 
      or when you use the PutKeyPolicy operation to set a key policy.

      DestinationEncryptionContext
         Speciﬁes that encryption context to use when the reencrypting the data.
              Important
              Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
              displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
         A destination encryption context is valid only when the destination KMS key is a symmetric 
         encryption KMS key. The standard ciphertext format for asymmetric KMS keys does not include 
         ﬁelds for metadata.
         An encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represent additional 
         authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the 
         same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption 
         context is supported only on operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys. On operations 
         with symmetric encryption KMS keys, an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly 
         recommended.

      SourceEncryptionAlgorithm
         Speciﬁes the encryption algorithm that AWS KMS will use to decrypt the ciphertext before it 
         is reencrypted. The default value, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, represents the algorithm used for 
         symmetric encryption KMS keys.
         Specify the same algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. If you specify a diﬀerent 
         algorithm, the decrypt attempt fails.
         This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS 
         key.

      SourceEncryptionContext
         Speciﬁes the encryption context to use to decrypt the ciphertext. Enter the same encryption 
         context that was used to encrypt the ciphertext.
         An encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represent additional 
         authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the

      SourceKeyId
         Speciﬁes the KMS key that AWS KMS will use to decrypt the ciphertext before it is re-encrypted.
         Enter a key ID of the KMS key that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. If you identify a diﬀerent 
         KMS key, the ReEncrypt operation throws an IncorrectKeyException.
         This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS 
         key. If you used a symmetric encryption KMS key, AWS KMS can get the KMS key from metadata 
         that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, it is always recommended as a best 
         practice. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.
         To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias 
         name, preﬁx it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use 
         the key ARN or alias ARN.
         For example:
         •
           Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         •

         •
           Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias
         To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or DescribeKey. To get the alias name

     ReplicateKey
     Replicates a multi-Region key into the speciﬁed Region. This operation creates a multi-Region 
     replica key based on a multi-Region primary key in a diﬀerent Region of the same AWS partition. 
     You can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a diﬀerent Region. To create 
     a multi-Region primary key, use the CreateKey operation.
     This operation supports multi-Region keys, an AWS KMS feature that lets you create multiple 
     interoperable KMS keys in diﬀerent AWS Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, 
     key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one AWS 
     Region and decrypt it in a diﬀerent AWS Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-
     Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Multi-Region keys in AWS KMS in 
     the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
     A replica key is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used independently of its primary and peer 
     replica keys. A primary key and its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. 
     They have the same key ID and key material. They also have the same key spec, key usage, key 
     material origin, and automatic key rotation status. AWS KMS automatically synchronizes these 
     shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica key can diﬀer, 
     including its key policy, tags, aliases, and key state. AWS KMS pricing and quotas for KMS keys 
     apply to each primary key and replica key.
     When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state of Creating. This 
     key state changes to Enabled (or PendingImport) after a few seconds when the process of 
     creating the new replica key is complete. While the key state is Creating, you can manage key, 
     but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If you are creating and using the replica 
     key programmatically, retry on KMSInvalidStateException or call DescribeKey to check its
     KeyState value before using it. For details about the Creating key state, see Key states of AWS 
     KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
     You cannot create more than one replica of a primary key in any Region. If the Region 
     already includes a replica of the key you're trying to replicate, ReplicateKey returns an
     AlreadyExistsException error. If the key state of the existing replica is PendingDeletion, 
     you can cancel the scheduled key deletion (CancelKeyDeletion) or wait for the key to be deleted. 
     The new replica key you create will have the same shared properties as the original replica key.
     The AWS CloudTrail log of a ReplicateKey operation records a ReplicateKey operation in the 
     primary key's Region and a CreateKey operation in the replica key's Region.
     ReplicateKey                                           API Version 2014-11-01 310
      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, the replica key is created 
      with no key material. You must import the same key material that you imported into the primary 
      key.
      To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation.
           Note
           ReplicateKey uses diﬀerent default values for the KeyPolicy and Tags parameters 
           than those used in the AWS KMS console. For details, see the parameter descriptions.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot use this operation to create a replica key in a diﬀerent AWS 
      account.
      Required permissions:
      •
        kms:ReplicateKey on the primary key (in the primary key's Region). Include this permission in 
        the primary key's key policy.
      •
        kms:CreateKey in an IAM policy in the replica Region.
      •
        To use the Tags parameter, kms:TagResource in an IAM policy in the replica Region.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                     API Reference
         Enter the Region ID, such as us-east-1 or ap-southeast-2. For a list of AWS Regions in 
         which AWS KMS is supported, see AWS KMS service endpoints in the Amazon Web Services 
         General Reference.
         The replica must be in a diﬀerent AWS Region than its primary key and other replicas of that 
         primary key, but in the same AWS partition. AWS KMS must be available in the replica Region. 
         If the Region is not enabled by default, the AWS account must be enabled in the Region. For 
         information about AWS partitions, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web

      BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck
         Skips ("bypasses") the key policy lockout safety check. The default value is false.
              Important
              Setting this value to true increases the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. 
              Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.
              For more information, see Default key policy in the  AWS Key Management Service 
              Developer Guide.
         Use this parameter only when you intend to prevent the principal that is making the request 
         from making a subsequent PutKeyPolicy request on the KMS key.
         Type: Boolean
         Required: No
      Description
         A description of the KMS key. The default value is an empty string (no description).

              Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
              displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
         The description is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify the same 
         description or a diﬀerent description for each key in a set of related multi-Region keys. AWS 
         KMS does not synchronize this property.
         Type: String
         Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 8192.
         Required: No
      Policy
         The key policy to attach to the KMS key. This parameter is optional. If you do not provide a key 
         policy, AWS KMS attaches the default key policy to the KMS key.
         The key policy is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify the same key 
         policy or a diﬀerent key policy for each key in a set of related multi-Region keys. AWS KMS does 
         not synchronize this property.
         If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:
         •
           The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a subsequent PutKeyPolicy request 
           on the KMS key. This reduces the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more 
           information, see Default key policy in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. (To 
           omit this condition, set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true.)
         • Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the 
           key policy must exist and be visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal, you 
           might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because

      Tags
         Assigns one or more tags to the replica key. Use this parameter to tag the KMS key when it is 
         created. To tag an existing KMS key, use the TagResource operation.
              Important
              Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
              displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
              Note
              Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For 
              details, see ABAC for AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
         To use this parameter, you must have kms:TagResource permission in an IAM policy.
         Tags are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify the same tags or diﬀerent 
         tags for each key in a set of related multi-Region keys. AWS KMS does not synchronize this 
         property.
         Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and the tag value are required, 
         but the tag value can be an empty (null) string. You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS 
      Request Parameters                                                     API Version 2014-11-01 315

         key with the same tag key. If you specify an existing tag key with a diﬀerent tag value, AWS 
         KMS replaces the current tag value with the speciﬁed one.
         When you add tags to an AWS resource, AWS generates a cost allocation report with usage and 
         costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For details, see
         Tags in AWS KMS.

      RetireGrant
      Deletes a grant. Typically, you retire a grant when you no longer need its permissions. To identify 
      the grant to retire, use a grant token, or both the grant ID and a key identiﬁer (key ID or key ARN) 
      of the KMS key. The CreateGrant operation returns both values.
      This operation can be called by the retiring principal for a grant, by the grantee principal if the grant 
      allows the RetireGrant operation, and by the AWS account in which the grant is created. It can 
      also be called by principals to whom permission for retiring a grant is delegated.
      For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see Grants in AWS KMS in 
      the   AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . For examples of creating grants in several 
      programming languages, see Use CreateGrant with an AWS SDK or CLI.
      Cross-account use: Yes. You can retire a grant on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account.
      Required permissions: Permission to retire a grant is determined primarily by the grant. For 
      details, see Retiring and revoking grants in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      RevokeGrant
      Deletes the speciﬁed grant. You revoke a grant to terminate the permissions that the grant allows. 
      For more information, see Retiring and revoking grants in the   AWS Key Management Service 
      Developer Guide .
      When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief delay, usually less than ﬁve 
      minutes, until the grant is available throughout AWS KMS. This state is known as eventual 
      consistency. For details, see Eventual consistency in the   AWS Key Management Service Developer 
      Guide .
      For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see Grants in AWS KMS in 
      the   AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . For examples of creating grants in several 
      programming languages, see Use CreateGrant with an AWS SDK or CLI.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, specify 
      the key ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.
      Required permissions: kms:RevokeGrant (key policy).

      RotateKeyOnDemand
      Immediately initiates rotation of the key material of the speciﬁed symmetric encryption KMS key.
      You can perform on-demand rotation of the key material in customer managed KMS keys, 
      regardless of whether or not automatic key rotation is enabled. On-demand rotations do not 
      change existing automatic rotation schedules. For example, consider a KMS key that has automatic 
      key rotation enabled with a rotation period of 730 days. If the key is scheduled to automatically 
      rotate on April 14, 2024, and you perform an on-demand rotation on April 10, 2024, the key will 
      automatically rotate, as scheduled, on April 14, 2024 and every 730 days thereafter.
           Note
           You can perform on-demand key rotation a maximum of 10 times per KMS key. You can 
           use the AWS KMS console to view the number of remaining on-demand rotations available 
           for a KMS key.
      You can use GetKeyRotationStatus to identify any in progress on-demand rotations. You can 
      use ListKeyRotations to identify the date that completed on-demand rotations were performed. 
      You can monitor rotation of the key material for your KMS keys in AWS CloudTrail and Amazon 
      CloudWatch.
      On-demand key rotation is supported only on symmetric encryption KMS keys. You cannot 
      perform on-demand rotation of asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, multi-Region KMS keys 
      with imported key material, or KMS keys in a custom key store. When you initiate on-demand key 
      rotation on a symmetric encryption KMS key with imported key material, you must have already 
      imported new key material and that key material's state should be PENDING_ROTATION. Use the
      ListKeyRotations operation to check the state of all key materials associated with a KMS key. 
      To perform on-demand rotation of a set of related multi-Region keys, invoke the on-demand 
      rotation on the primary key.
      You cannot initiate on-demand rotation of AWS managed KMS keys. AWS KMS always rotates the 
      key material of AWS managed keys every year. Rotation of AWS owned KMS keys is managed by 
      the AWS service that owns the key.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      ScheduleKeyDeletion
      Schedules the deletion of a KMS key. By default, AWS KMS applies a waiting period of 30 days, 
      but you can specify a waiting period of 7-30 days. When this operation is successful, the key state 
      of the KMS key changes to PendingDeletion and the key can't be used in any cryptographic 
      operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the waiting period. Before the waiting period 
      ends, you can use CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the waiting 
      period ends, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key, its key material, and all AWS KMS data associated with 
      it, including all aliases that refer to it.
           Important
           Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a KMS 
           key is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the KMS key is unrecoverable. (The only 
           exception is a multi-Region replica key, or an asymmetric or HMAC KMS key with imported 
           key material.) To prevent the use of a KMS key without deleting it, use DisableKey.
      You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its replica keys at any 
      time. However, AWS KMS will not delete a multi-Region primary key with existing replica 
      keys. If you schedule the deletion of a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to
      PendingReplicaDeletion and it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic operations. 
      This status can continue indeﬁnitely. When the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just 
      scheduled), the key state of the primary key changes to PendingDeletion and its waiting period 
      (PendingWindowInDays) begins. For details, see Deleting multi-Region keys in the  AWS Key 
      Management Service Developer Guide.
      When AWS KMS deletes a KMS key from an AWS CloudHSM key store, it makes a best eﬀort to 
      delete the associated key material from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. However, you might 
      need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. Deleting 
      a KMS key from an external key store has no eﬀect on the associated external key. However, for 
      both types of custom key stores, deleting a KMS key is destructive and irreversible. You cannot 
      decrypt ciphertext encrypted under the KMS key by using only its associated external key or AWS 
      CloudHSM key. Also, you cannot recreate a KMS key in an external key store by creating a new KMS 
      key with the same key material.
      For more information about scheduling a KMS key for deletion, see Deleting KMS keys in the  AWS 
      Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      Sign
      Creates a digital signature for a message or message digest by using the private key in an 
      asymmetric signing KMS key. To verify the signature, use the Verify operation, or use the public 
      key in the same asymmetric KMS key outside of AWS KMS. For information about asymmetric KMS 
      keys, see Asymmetric KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Digital signatures are generated and veriﬁed by using asymmetric key pair, such as an RSA, ECC, or 
      ML-DSA pair that is represented by an asymmetric KMS key. The key owner (or an authorized user) 
      uses their private key to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the message 
      was signed with that particular private key and that the message hasn't changed since it was 
      signed.
      To use the Sign operation, provide the following information:
      •
        Use the KeyId parameter to identify an asymmetric KMS key with a KeyUsage value of
        SIGN_VERIFY. To get the KeyUsage value of a KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation. The 
        caller must have kms:Sign permission on the KMS key.
      •
        Use the Message parameter to specify the message or message digest to sign. You can submit 
        messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a larger message, generate a hash digest of the message, 
        and then provide the hash digest in the Message parameter. To indicate whether the message is 
        a full message, a digest, or an ML-DSA EXTERNAL_MU, use the MessageType parameter.
      • Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the KMS key.
           Important
           When signing a message, be sure to record the KMS key and the signing algorithm. This 
           information is required to verify the signature.
           Note
           Best practices recommend that you limit the time during which any signature is eﬀective. 
           This deters an attack where the actor uses a signed message to establish validity repeatedly 
           or long after the message is superseded. Signatures do not include a timestamp, but you 
      Sign                                                                API Version 2014-11-01 345

           can include a timestamp in the signed message to help you detect when its time to refresh 
           the signature.
      To verify the signature that this operation generates, use the Verify operation. Or use the
      GetPublicKey operation to download the public key and then use the public key to verify the 
      signature outside of AWS KMS.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, 
      specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

      KeyId
         Identiﬁes an asymmetric KMS key. AWS KMS uses the private key in the asymmetric KMS key 
         to sign the message. The KeyUsage type of the KMS key must be SIGN_VERIFY. To ﬁnd the
         KeyUsage of a KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
         To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias 
         name, preﬁx it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use 
         the key ARN or alias ARN.
         For example:
         •

      Request Parameters                                                       API Version 2014-11-01 348
      AWS Key Management Service                                                  API Reference
         are already hashed; use EXTERNAL_MU for 64-byte representative μ used in ML-DSA signing as 
         deﬁned in NIST FIPS 204 Section 6.2.
         When the value of MessageType is RAW, AWS KMS uses the standard signing algorithm, which 
         begins with a hash function. When the value is DIGEST, AWS KMS skips the hashing step in the 
         signing algorithm. When the value is EXTERNAL_MU AWS KMS skips the concatenated hashing 
         of the public key hash and the message done in the ML-DSA signing algorithm.
              Important
              Use the DIGEST or EXTERNAL_MU value only when the value of the Message parameter 
              is a message digest. If you use the DIGEST value with an unhashed message, the 
              security of the signing operation can be compromised.
         When the value of MessageType is DIGEST, the length of the Message value must match the 
         length of hashed messages for the speciﬁed signing algorithm.
         When the value of MessageType is EXTERNAL_MU the length of the Message value must be 64 
         bytes.
         You can submit a message digest and omit the MessageType or specify RAW so the digest is 
         hashed again while signing. However, this can cause veriﬁcation failures when verifying with a 
         system that assumes a single hash.
         The hashing algorithm that Sign uses is based on the SigningAlgorithm value.
         • Signing algorithms that end in SHA_256 use the SHA_256 hashing algorithm.
         • Signing algorithms that end in SHA_384 use the SHA_384 hashing algorithm.
         • Signing algorithms that end in SHA_512 use the SHA_512 hashing algorithm.
         • Signing algorithms that end in SHAKE_256 use the SHAKE_256 hashing algorithm.
         • SM2DSA uses the SM3 hashing algorithm. For details, see Oﬄine veriﬁcation with SM2 key 
           pairs.

      TagResource
      Adds or edits tags on a customer managed key.
           Note
           Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For details, 
           see ABAC for AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value, both of which are case-sensitive strings. The tag 
      value can be an empty (null) string. To add a tag, specify a new tag key and a tag value. To edit a 
      tag, specify an existing tag key and a new tag value.
      You can use this operation to tag a customer managed key, but you cannot tag an AWS managed 
      key, an AWS owned key, a custom key store, or an alias.
      You can also add tags to a KMS key while creating it (CreateKey) or replicating it (ReplicateKey).
      For information about using tags in AWS KMS, see Tagging keys. For general information about 
      tags, including the format and syntax, see Tagging AWS resources in the Amazon Web Services 
      General Reference.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS 
      account.

      UpdateAlias
      Associates an existing AWS KMS alias with a diﬀerent KMS key. Each alias is associated with only 
      one KMS key at a time, although a KMS key can have multiple aliases. The alias and the KMS key 
      must be in the same AWS account and Region.
           Note
           Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For 
           details, see ABAC for AWS KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      The current and new KMS key must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric or both 
      HMAC), and they must have the same key usage. This restriction prevents errors in code that uses 
      aliases. If you must assign an alias to a diﬀerent type of KMS key, use DeleteAlias to delete the old 
      alias and CreateAlias to create a new alias.
      You cannot use UpdateAlias to change an alias name. To change an alias name, use DeleteAlias
      to delete the old alias and CreateAlias to create a new alias.
      Because an alias is not a property of a KMS key, you can create, update, and delete the aliases 
      of a KMS key without aﬀecting the KMS key. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from 
      the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all KMS keys in the account, use the ListAliases
      operation.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS 
      account.
      Required permissions
      • kms:UpdateAlias on the alias (IAM policy).
      • kms:UpdateAlias on the current KMS key (key policy).
      • kms:UpdateAlias on the new KMS key (key policy).
      For details, see Controlling access to aliases in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

      TargetKeyId
         Identiﬁes the customer managed key to associate with the alias. You don't have permission to 
         associate an alias with an AWS managed key.
         The KMS key must be in the same AWS account and Region as the alias. Also, the new target 
         KMS key must be the same type as the current target KMS key (both symmetric or both 
         asymmetric or both HMAC) and they must have the same key usage.
         Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

      UpdateCustomKeyStore
      Changes the properties of a custom key store. You can use this operation to change the properties 
      of an AWS CloudHSM key store or an external key store.
      Use the required CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify the custom key store. Use the 
      remaining optional parameters to change its properties. This operation does not return any 
      property values. To verify the updated property values, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores
      operation.
      This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in AWS KMS, which combines the 
      convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a key store 
      that you own and manage.
           Important
           When updating the properties of an external key store, verify that the updated settings 
           connect your key store, via the external key store proxy, to the same external key manager 
           as the previous settings, or to a backup or snapshot of the external key manager with 
           the same cryptographic keys. If the updated connection settings fail, you can ﬁx them 
           and retry, although an extended delay might disrupt AWS services. However, if AWS KMS 
           permanently loses its access to cryptographic keys, ciphertext encrypted under those keys 
           is unrecoverable.
           Note
           For external key stores:
           Some external key managers provide a simpler method for updating an external key store. 
           For details, see your external key manager documentation.
           When updating an external key store in the AWS KMS console, you can upload a JSON-
           based proxy conﬁguration ﬁle with the desired values. You cannot upload the proxy 
           conﬁguration ﬁle to the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation. However, you can use the ﬁle 
           to help you determine the correct values for the UpdateCustomKeyStore parameters.
      For an AWS CloudHSM key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store 
      friendly name (NewCustomKeyStoreName), to tell AWS KMS about a change to the kmsuser
      UpdateCustomKeyStore                                                     API Version 2014-11-01 371
      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
      crypto user password (KeyStorePassword), or to associate the custom key store with a diﬀerent, 
      but related, AWS CloudHSM cluster (CloudHsmClusterId). To update any property of an 
      AWS CloudHSM key store, the ConnectionState of the AWS CloudHSM key store must be
      DISCONNECTED.
      For an external key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly 
      name (NewCustomKeyStoreName), or to tell AWS KMS about a change to the external key 
      store proxy authentication credentials (XksProxyAuthenticationCredential), connection 
      method (XksProxyConnectivity), external proxy endpoint (XksProxyUriEndpoint) 
      and path (XksProxyUriPath). For external key stores with an XksProxyConnectivity
      of VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE, you can also update the Amazon VPC endpoint service name 
      (XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName). To update most properties of an external key store, the
      ConnectionState of the external key store must be DISCONNECTED. However, you can update 
      the CustomKeyStoreName, XksProxyAuthenticationCredential, and XksProxyUriPath of 
      an external key store when it is in the CONNECTED or DISCONNECTED state.
      If your update requires a DISCONNECTED state, before using UpdateCustomKeyStore, 
      use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store. After 
      the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation completes, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore to 
      reconnect the custom key store. To ﬁnd the ConnectionState of the custom key store, use the
      DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
      Before updating the custom key store, verify that the new values allow AWS KMS to connect the 
      custom key store to its backing key store. For example, before you change the XksProxyUriPath
      value, verify that the external key store proxy is reachable at the new path.
      If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.
      Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a diﬀerent 
      AWS account.

     UpdatePrimaryRegion
     Changes the primary key of a multi-Region key.
     This operation changes the replica key in the speciﬁed Region to a primary key and changes the 
     former primary key to a replica key. For example, suppose you have a primary key in us-east-1
     and a replica key in eu-west-2. If you run UpdatePrimaryRegion with a PrimaryRegion value 
     of eu-west-2, the primary key is now the key in eu-west-2, and the key in us-east-1 becomes 
     a replica key. For details, see Change the primary key in a set of multi-Region keys in the  AWS Key 
     Management Service Developer Guide.
     This operation supports multi-Region keys, an AWS KMS feature that lets you create multiple 
     interoperable KMS keys in diﬀerent AWS Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, 
     key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one AWS 
     Region and decrypt it in a diﬀerent AWS Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-
     Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Multi-Region keys in AWS KMS in 
     the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
     The primary key of a multi-Region key is the source for properties that are always shared by 
     primary and replica keys, including the key material, key ID, key spec, key usage, key material 
     origin, and automatic key rotation. It's the only key that can be replicated. You cannot delete the 
     primary key until all replica keys are deleted.
     The key ID and primary Region that you specify uniquely identify the replica key that will become 
     the primary key. The primary Region must already have a replica key. This operation does not 
     create a KMS key in the speciﬁed Region. To ﬁnd the replica keys, use the DescribeKey operation on 
     the primary key or any replica key. To create a replica key, use the ReplicateKey operation.
     You can run this operation while using the aﬀected multi-Region keys in cryptographic operations. 
     This operation should not delay, interrupt, or cause failures in cryptographic operations.
     Even after this operation completes, the process of updating the primary Region might still be 
     in progress for a few more seconds. Operations such as DescribeKey might display both the 
     old and new primary keys as replicas. The old and new primary keys have a transient key state of
     Updating. The original key state is restored when the update is complete. While the key state is
     Updating, you can use the keys in cryptographic operations, but you cannot replicate the new 
     primary key or perform certain management operations, such as enabling or disabling these 
     keys. For details about the Updating key state, see Key states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key 
     Management Service Developer Guide.

      Verify
      Veriﬁes a digital signature that was generated by the Sign operation.
      Veriﬁcation conﬁrms that an authorized user signed the message with the speciﬁed KMS key and 
      signing algorithm, and the message hasn't changed since it was signed. If the signature is veriﬁed, 
      the value of the SignatureValid ﬁeld in the response is True. If the signature veriﬁcation fails, 
      the Verify operation fails with an KMSInvalidSignatureException exception.
      A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric KMS key. The signature 
      is veriﬁed by using the public key in the same asymmetric KMS key. For information about 
      asymmetric KMS keys, see Asymmetric KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer 
      Guide.
      To use the Verify operation, specify the same asymmetric KMS key, message, and signing 
      algorithm that were used to produce the signature. The message type does not need to be 
      the same as the one used for signing, but it must indicate whether the value of the Message
      parameter should be hashed as part of the veriﬁcation process.
      You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the KMS key outside of AWS 
      KMS. Use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key in the asymmetric KMS key 
      and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS KMS. The advantage of using 
      the Verify operation is that it is performed within AWS KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the 
      operation is performed within the FIPS boundary, it is logged in AWS CloudTrail, and you can use 
      key policy and IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the KMS key to verify signatures.
      To verify a signature outside of AWS KMS with an SM2 public key (China Regions only), you must 
      specify the distinguishing ID. By default, AWS KMS uses 1234567812345678 as the distinguishing 
      ID. For more information, see Oﬄine veriﬁcation with SM2 key pairs.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, 
      specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

           In the following list, the required parameters are described ﬁrst.
      KeyId
         Identiﬁes the asymmetric KMS key that will be used to verify the signature. This must be the 
         same KMS key that was used to generate the signature. If you specify a diﬀerent KMS key, the

      MessageType
         Tells AWS KMS whether the value of the Message parameter should be hashed as part of the 
         signing algorithm. Use RAW for unhashed messages; use DIGEST for message digests, which 
         are already hashed; use EXTERNAL_MU for 64-byte representative μ used in ML-DSA signing as 
         deﬁned in NIST FIPS 204 Section 6.2.
         When the value of MessageType is RAW, AWS KMS uses the standard signing algorithm, which 
         begins with a hash function. When the value is DIGEST, AWS KMS skips the hashing step in the 
      Request Parameters                                                       API Version 2014-11-01 396
      AWS Key Management Service                                                        API Reference
         signing algorithm. When the value is EXTERNAL_MU AWS KMS skips the concatenated hashing 
         of the public key hash and the message done in the ML-DSA signing algorithm.
              Important
              Use the DIGEST or EXTERNAL_MU value only when the value of the Message parameter 
              is a message digest. If you use the DIGEST value with an unhashed message, the 
              security of the signing operation can be compromised.
         When the value of MessageType is DIGEST, the length of the Message value must match the 
         length of hashed messages for the speciﬁed signing algorithm.
         When the value of MessageType is EXTERNAL_MU the length of the Message value must be 64 
         bytes.
         You can submit a message digest and omit the MessageType or specify RAW so the digest is 
         hashed again while signing. However, if the signed message is hashed once while signing, but 
         twice while verifying, veriﬁcation fails, even when the message hasn't changed.
         The hashing algorithm that Verify uses is based on the SigningAlgorithm value.
         • Signing algorithms that end in SHA_256 use the SHA_256 hashing algorithm.
         • Signing algorithms that end in SHA_384 use the SHA_384 hashing algorithm.
         • Signing algorithms that end in SHA_512 use the SHA_512 hashing algorithm.
         • Signing algorithms that end in SHAKE_256 use the SHAKE_256 hashing algorithm.

      VerifyMac
      Veriﬁes the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) for a speciﬁed message, HMAC KMS 
      key, and MAC algorithm. To verify the HMAC, VerifyMac computes an HMAC using the message, 
      HMAC KMS key, and MAC algorithm that you specify, and compares the computed HMAC to the 
      HMAC that you specify. If the HMACs are identical, the veriﬁcation succeeds; otherwise, it fails. 
      Veriﬁcation indicates that the message hasn't changed since the HMAC was calculated, and the 
      speciﬁed key was used to generate and verify the HMAC.
      HMAC KMS keys and the HMAC algorithms that AWS KMS uses conform to industry standards 
      deﬁned in RFC 2104.
      This operation is part of AWS KMS support for HMAC KMS keys. For details, see HMAC keys in AWS 
      KMS in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key 
      states of AWS KMS keys in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
      Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, 
      specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

         Describes the connection error. This ﬁeld appears in the response only when the
         ConnectionState is FAILED.
         Many failures can be resolved by updating the properties of the custom key store. To 
         update a custom key store, disconnect it (DisconnectCustomKeyStore), correct the errors 
         (UpdateCustomKeyStore), and try to connect again (ConnectCustomKeyStore). For additional 
         help resolving these errors, see How to Fix a Connection Failure in  AWS Key Management 
         Service Developer Guide.
         All custom key stores:
         •
           INTERNAL_ERROR — AWS KMS could not complete the request due to an internal error. Retry 
           the request. For ConnectCustomKeyStore requests, disconnect the custom key store before 
           trying to connect again.
         •
           NETWORK_ERRORS — Network errors are preventing AWS KMS from connecting the custom 
           key store to its backing key store.

         AWS CloudHSM key stores:
         •
           CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND — AWS KMS cannot ﬁnd the AWS CloudHSM cluster with the speciﬁed 
           cluster ID.
         •
           INSUFFICIENT_CLOUDHSM_HSMS — The associated AWS CloudHSM cluster does not contain 
           any active HSMs. To connect a custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, the cluster 
           must contain at least one active HSM.
         •
           INSUFFICIENT_FREE_ADDRESSES_IN_SUBNET — At least one private subnet associated 
           with the AWS CloudHSM cluster doesn't have any available IP addresses. A AWS CloudHSM 
           key store connection requires one free IP address in each of the associated private subnets, 
           although two are preferable. For details, see How to Fix a Connection Failure in the  AWS Key 
           Management Service Developer Guide.
         •
           INVALID_CREDENTIALS — The KeyStorePassword for the custom key store doesn't match 
           the current password of the kmsuser crypto user in the AWS CloudHSM cluster. Before 
           you can connect your custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, you must change the
           kmsuser account password and update the KeyStorePassword value for the custom key 
           store.
         •
           SUBNET_NOT_FOUND — A subnet in the AWS CloudHSM cluster conﬁguration was deleted. If 
           AWS KMS cannot ﬁnd all of the subnets in the cluster conﬁguration, attempts to connect the 
           custom key store to the AWS CloudHSM cluster fail. To ﬁx this error, create a cluster from a 
           recent backup and associate it with your custom key store. (This process creates a new cluster 
           conﬁguration with a VPC and private subnets.) For details, see How to Fix a Connection 
           Failure in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
         •
           USER_LOCKED_OUT — The kmsuser CU account is locked out of the associated AWS 
           CloudHSM cluster due to too many failed password attempts. Before you can connect your 
           custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, you must change the kmsuser account 
           password and update the key store password value for the custom key store.
         •
           USER_LOGGED_IN — The kmsuser CU account is logged into the associated AWS CloudHSM 
           cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from rotating the kmsuser account password and logging 
           into the cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, 
           you must log the kmsuser CU out of the cluster. If you changed the kmsuser password to 
           log into the cluster, you must also and update the key store password value for the custom 
           key store. For help, see How to Log Out and Reconnect in the  AWS Key Management Service 
           Developer Guide.

         External key stores:
         •
           INVALID_CREDENTIALS — One or both of the XksProxyAuthenticationCredential
           values is not valid on the speciﬁed external key store proxy.
         •
           XKS_PROXY_ACCESS_DENIED — AWS KMS requests are denied access to the external key 
           store proxy. If the external key store proxy has authorization rules, verify that they permit 
           AWS KMS to communicate with the proxy on your behalf.
         •
           XKS_PROXY_INVALID_CONFIGURATION — A conﬁguration error is preventing the external 
           key store from connecting to its proxy. Verify the value of the XksProxyUriPath.
         •
           XKS_PROXY_INVALID_RESPONSE — AWS KMS cannot interpret the response from the 
           external key store proxy. If you see this connection error code repeatedly, notify your external 
           key store proxy vendor.
         •
           XKS_PROXY_INVALID_TLS_CONFIGURATION — AWS KMS cannot connect to the external 
           key store proxy because the TLS conﬁguration is invalid. Verify that the XKS proxy supports 
           TLS 1.2 or 1.3. Also, verify that the TLS certiﬁcate is not expired, and that it matches the 
           hostname in the XksProxyUriEndpoint value, and that it is signed by a certiﬁcate 
           authority included in the Trusted Certiﬁcate Authorities list.
         •
           XKS_PROXY_NOT_REACHABLE — AWS KMS can't communicate with your external key store 
           proxy. Verify that the XksProxyUriEndpoint and XksProxyUriPath are correct. Use 
           the tools for your external key store proxy to verify that the proxy is active and available on 
           its network. Also, verify that your external key manager instances are operating properly. 
           Connection attempts fail with this connection error code if the proxy reports that all external 
           key manager instances are unavailable.
         •
           XKS_PROXY_TIMED_OUT — AWS KMS can connect to the external key store proxy, but the 
           proxy does not respond to AWS KMS in the time allotted. If you see this connection error code 
           repeatedly, notify your external key store proxy vendor.
         •
           XKS_VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_INVALID_CONFIGURATION — The Amazon VPC endpoint 
           service conﬁguration doesn't conform to the requirements for an AWS KMS external key 
           store.
           • The VPC endpoint service must be an endpoint service for interface endpoints in the caller's 
             AWS account.

      GrantConstraints
      Use this structure to allow cryptographic operations in the grant only when the operation request 
      includes the speciﬁed encryption context.
      AWS KMS applies the grant constraints only to cryptographic operations that support an 
      encryption context, that is, all cryptographic operations with a symmetric KMS key. Grant 
      constraints are not applied to operations that do not support an encryption context, such as 
      cryptographic operations with asymmetric KMS keys and management operations, such as
      DescribeKey or RetireGrant.
           Important
           In a cryptographic operation, the encryption context in the decryption operation must be 
           an exact, case-sensitive match for the keys and values in the encryption context of the 
           encryption operation. Only the order of the pairs can vary.
           However, in a grant constraint, the key in each key-value pair is not case sensitive, but the 
           value is case sensitive.
           To avoid confusion, do not use multiple encryption context pairs that diﬀer only by case. 
           To require a fully case-sensitive encryption context, use the kms:EncryptionContext:
           and kms:EncryptionContextKeys conditions in an IAM or key policy. For details, see
           kms:EncryptionContext:context-key in the   AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide
