     AWS Key Management Service
     AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an AWS managed service that makes it easy for you to 
     create and control the encryption keys that are used to encrypt your data. The AWS KMS keys that 
     you create in AWS KMS are protected by FIPS 140-3 Security Level 3 validated hardware security 
     modules (HSM). They never leave AWS KMS unencrypted. To use or manage your KMS keys, you 
     interact with AWS KMS.
     Why use AWS KMS?
     When you encrypt data, you need to protect your encryption key. If you encrypt your key, you need 
     to protect its encryption key. Eventually, you must protect the highest level encryption key (known 
     as a root key) in the hierarchy that protects your data. That's where AWS KMS comes in.
     AWS KMS protects your root keys. KMS keys are created, managed, used, and deleted entirely 
     within AWS KMS. They never leave the service unencrypted. To use or manage your KMS keys, you 
     call AWS KMS.
     Why use AWS KMS?                                                   1
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     Additionally, you can create and manage key policies in AWS KMS, ensuring that only trusted users 
     have access to KMS keys.
     AWS KMS in AWS Regions
     The AWS Regions in which AWS KMS is supported are listed in AWS Key Management Service 
     Endpoints and Quotas. If an AWS KMS feature is not supported in an AWS Region that AWS KMS 
     supports, the regional diﬀerence is described in the topic about the feature.
     AWS KMS pricing
     As with other AWS products, using AWS KMS does not require contracts or minimum purchases. For 
     more information about AWS KMS pricing, see AWS Key Management Service Pricing.
     AWS KMS service level agreement
     AWS Key Management Service is backed by a service level agreement that deﬁnes our service 
     availability policy.
     AWS KMS in AWS Regions                                             2
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Accessing AWS Key Management Service
      You can work with AWS KMS in the following ways:
      Topics
      • AWS Management Console
      • AWS Command Line Interface
      • AWS KMS REST API
      • AWS SDKs
      • Using this service with an AWS SDK
      • AWS Encryption SDK
      • AWS KMS eventual consistency
      • Using hybrid post-quantum TLS with AWS KMS
      • Connect to AWS KMS through a VPC endpoint
      • Dual-stack endpoint support
      AWS Management Console
      The console is a web-based user interface for managing AWS KMS and AWS resources. If you've 
      signed up for an AWS account, you can access the AWS KMS console by signing into the AWS 
      Management Console and choosing AWS KMS from the AWS Management Console home page.
      Permissions required to use the AWS KMS console
      To work with the AWS KMS console, users must have a minimum set of permissions that allow 
      them to work with the AWS KMS resources in their AWS account. In addition to these AWS KMS 
      permissions, users must also have permissions to list IAM users and IAM roles. If you create an IAM 
      policy that is more restrictive than the minimum required permissions, the AWS KMS console won't 
      function as intended for users with that IAM policy.
      For the minimum permissions required to allow a user read-only access to the AWS KMS console, 
      see Allow a user to view KMS keys in the AWS KMS console.
      AWS Management Console                                                                    3
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      To allow users to work with the AWS KMS console to create and manage KMS keys, attach the
      AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser managed policy to the user, as described in AWS 
      managed policies for AWS Key Management Service.
      You don't need to allow minimum console permissions for users that are working with the AWS 
      KMS API through the AWS SDKs, AWS Command Line Interface, or AWS Tools for PowerShell. 
      However, you do need to grant these users permission to use the API. For more information, see
      Permissions reference.
      AWS Command Line Interface
      You can use the AWS CLI tools to issue commands or build scripts at your system's command line to 
      perform AWS (including AWS KMS) tasks.
      For more information about using AWS KMS through the AWS CLI, see the AWS CLI Command 
      Reference
      AWS KMS REST API
      The architecture of AWS KMS is designed to be programming language-neutral. The REST API is an 
      HTTP interface to AWS KMS. With the REST API, you use standard HTTP requests to create, fetch, 
      and delete keys.
      For more information on using the AWS KMS REST API, see the AWS Key Management Service API 
      Reference
      AWS SDKs
      AWS provides SDKs (software development kits) that consist of libraries and sample code for 
      common programming languages and platforms (Java, JavaScript, C, Python, and so on). The AWS 
      SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and AWS. AWS KMS 
      is a REST service. You can send requests to AWS KMS using the AWS SDK libraries, which wrap the 
      underlying AWS KMS REST API and simplify your programming tasks. For information about the 
      AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools to Build on AWS.
      The Code examples for AWS KMS using AWS SDKs provides a good starting point for using AWS 
      KMS through the AWS SDKs.

      AWS Encryption SDK
      The AWS Encryption SDK is a tool for implementing client-side encryption in your application. It 
      does not provide full access to KMS, but instead it integrates with AWS KMS, or can be used as 
      a stand-alone SDK without referencing KMS keys. Libraries are available for Java, JavaScript, C, 
      Python, and other programming languages.
      For more information, see the AWS Encryption SDK Developer Guide.
      AWS KMS key policies and IAM policies
      AWS KMS eventual consistency
      The AWS KMS API follows an eventual consistency model due to the distributed nature of the 
      system. As a result, changes to AWS KMS resources might not be immediately visible to the 
      subsequent commands you run.
      When you perform AWS KMS API calls, there might be a brief delay before the change is available 
      throughout AWS KMS. It typically takes less than a few seconds for the change to propagate 
      throughout the system, but in some cases it can take several minutes. You might get unexpected 
      errors, such as a NotFoundException or an InvalidStateException, during this time. For 
      example, AWS KMS might return a NotFoundException if you call GetParametersForImport
      immediately after calling CreateKey.
      We recommend that you conﬁgure a retry strategy on your AWS KMS clients to automatically retry 
      operations after a brief waiting period. For more information, see Retry behavior in the AWS SDKs 
      and Tools Reference Guide.
      For grant related API calls, you can use a grant token to avoid any potential delay and use the 
      permissions in a grant immediately. For more information, see Eventual consistency (for grants).

      Using hybrid post-quantum TLS with AWS KMS
      AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) supports a hybrid post-quantum key exchange option 
      for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) network encryption protocol. You can use this TLS option 
      when you connect to AWS KMS API endpoints. These optional hybrid post-quantum key exchange 
      features are at least as secure as the TLS encryption we use today and are likely to provide 
      additional long-term security beneﬁts. However, they aﬀect latency and throughput compared to 
      the classic key exchange protocols in use today.
      The data that you send to AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is protected in transit by the 
      encryption provided by a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection. The classic cipher suites that 
      AWS KMS supports for TLS sessions make brute force attacks on the key exchange mechanisms 
      infeasible with current technology. However, if large-scale quantum computing becomes practical 
      in the future, the classic cipher suites used in TLS key exchange mechanisms will be susceptible 
      to these attacks. If you’re developing applications that rely on the long-term conﬁdentiality 
      of data passed over a TLS connection, you should consider a plan to migrate to post-quantum 
      cryptography before large-scale quantum computers become available for use. AWS is working to 
      prepare for this future, and we want you to be well-prepared, too.
      To protect data encrypted today against potential future attacks, AWS is participating with the 
      cryptographic community in the development of quantum-resistant or post-quantum algorithms. 
      We've implemented hybrid post-quantum key exchange cipher suites in AWS KMS that combine 
      classic and post-quantum elements to ensure that your TLS connection is at least as strong as it 
      would be with classic cipher suites.
      These hybrid cipher suites are available for use on your production workloads in most AWS 
      Regions. However, because the performance characteristics and bandwidth requirements of hybrid 
      cipher suites are diﬀerent from those of classic key exchange mechanisms, we recommend that you
      test them on your AWS KMS API calls under diﬀerent conditions.
      Feedback
      As always, we welcome your feedback and participation in our open-source repositories. We’d 
      especially like to hear how your infrastructure interacts with this new variant of TLS traﬃc.

      Supported AWS Regions
      Post-quantum TLS for AWS KMS is available in all AWS Regions that AWS KMS supports except for 
      China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia).
           Note
           AWS KMS does not support hybrid post-quantum TLS for FIPS endpoints in AWS GovCloud 
           (US).
      For a list of AWS KMS endpoints for each AWS Region, see AWS Key Management Service 
      endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. For information about FIPS 
      endpoints, see FIPS endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
      About hybrid post-quantum key exchange in TLS
      AWS KMS supports hybrid post-quantum key exchange cipher suites. You can use the AWS SDK for 
      Java 2.x and AWS Common Runtime on Linux systems to conﬁgure an HTTP client that uses these 
      cipher suites. Then, whenever you connect to an AWS KMS endpoint with your HTTP client, the 
      hybrid cipher suites are used.
      This HTTP client uses s2n-tls, which is an open source implementation of the TLS protocol. The 
      hybrid cipher suites that s2n-tls uses are implemented only for key exchange, not for direct data 
      encryption. During key exchange, the client and server calculate the key they will use to encrypt 
      and decrypt the data on the wire.
      The algorithms that s2n-tls uses are a hybrid that combines Elliptic Curve Diﬃe-Hellman (ECDH), 
      a classic key exchange algorithm used today in TLS, with Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation 
      Mechanism (ML-KEM), a public-key encryption and key-establishment algorithm that the National 
      Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)  has designated as its ﬁrst standard post-quantum 
      key-agreement algorithm. This hybrid uses each of the algorithms independently to generate a key. 
      Then it combines the two keys cryptographically. With s2n-tls, you can conﬁgure an HTTP client to 
      About post-quantum TLS                                                            8

      prefer post-quantum TLS, which places ECDH with ML-KEM ﬁrst in the preference list. Classic key 
      exchange algorithms are included in the preference list to ensure compatibility, but they are lower 
      in the preference order.
      Using hybrid post-quantum TLS with AWS KMS
      You can use hybrid post-quantum TLS for your calls to AWS KMS. When setting up your HTTP client 
      test environment, be aware of the following information:
      Encryption in Transit
      The hybrid cipher suites in s2n-tls are used only for encryption in transit. They protect your data 
      while it is traveling from your client to the AWS KMS endpoint. AWS KMS does not use these cipher 
      suites to encrypt data under AWS KMS keys.
      Instead, when AWS KMS encrypts your data under KMS keys, it uses symmetric cryptography with 
      256-bit keys and the Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM) algorithm, 
      which is already quantum resistant. Theoretical future, large-scale quantum computing attacks on 
      ciphertexts created under 256-bit AES-GCM keys reduce the eﬀective security of the key to 128 
      bits. This security level is suﬃcient to make brute force attacks on AWS KMS ciphertexts infeasible.
      Supported Systems
      Use of the hybrid cipher suites in s2n-tls is currently supported only on Linux systems. In addition, 
      these cipher suites are supported only in SDKs that support the AWS Common Runtime, such as 
      the AWS SDK for Java 2.x. For an example, see Conﬁgure hybrid post-quantum TLS.
      AWS KMS Endpoints
      When using the hybrid cipher suites, use the standard AWS KMS endpoint. AWS KMS does not 
      support hybrid post-quantum TLS for FIPS 140-3 validated endpoints.
      When you conﬁgure a HTTP client to prefer post-quantum TLS connections with s2n-tls, the post-
      quantum ciphers are ﬁrst in the cipher preference list. However, the preference list includes the 
      classic, non-hybrid ciphers lower in the preference order for compatibility. When you conﬁgure an 
      HTTP client to prefer post-quantum TLS with an AWS KMS FIPS 140-3 validated endpoint, s2n-tls 
      negotiates a classic, non-hybrid key exchange cipher.
      For a list of AWS KMS endpoints for each AWS Region, see AWS Key Management Service 
      endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. For information about FIPS 
      endpoints, see FIPS endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
      How to use it                                                                       9
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Expected Performance
      Our early benchmark testing shows that the hybrid cipher suites in s2n-tls are slower than classic 
      TLS cipher suites. The eﬀect varies based on the network proﬁle, CPU speed, the number of cores, 
      and your call rate. For more information, see AWS post-quantum cryptography migration plan.
      Conﬁgure hybrid post-quantum TLS
      In this procedure, add a Maven dependency for the AWS Common Runtime HTTP Client. Next, 
      conﬁgure an HTTP client that prefers post-quantum TLS. Then, create an AWS KMS client that uses 
      the HTTP client.
      To see a complete working examples of conﬁguring and using hybrid post-quantum TLS with AWS 
      KMS, see the aws-kms-pq-tls-example repository.
           Note
           The AWS Common Runtime HTTP Client, which has been available as a preview, became 
           generally available in February 2023. In that release, the tlsCipherPreference
           class and the tlsCipherPreference() method parameter are replaced by the
           postQuantumTlsEnabled() method parameter. If you were using this example during 
           the preview, you need to update your code.
      1.  Add the AWS Common Runtime client to your Maven dependencies. We recommend using the 
          latest available version.
          For example, this statement adds version 2.30.22 of the AWS Common Runtime client to 
          your Maven dependencies.
            <dependency> 
                <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId> 
                <artifactId>aws-crt-client</artifactId> 
                <version>2.30.22</version>
            </dependency>
      2.  To enable the hybrid post-quantum cipher suites, add the AWS SDK for Java 2.x to your project 
          and initialize it. Then enable the hybrid post-quantum cipher suites on your HTTP client as 
          shown in the following example.
      Conﬁgure hybrid post-quantum TLS                                                         10
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
          This code uses the postQuantumTlsEnabled() method parameter to conﬁgure an AWS 
          common runtime HTTP client that prefers the recommended hybrid post-quantum cipher 
          suite, ECDH with ML-KEM. Then it uses the conﬁgured HTTP client to build an instance of the 
          AWS KMS asynchronous client, KmsAsyncClient. After this code completes, all AWS KMS API
          requests on the KmsAsyncClient instance use hybrid post-quantum TLS.
            // Configure HTTP client
            SdkAsyncHttpClient awsCrtHttpClient = AwsCrtAsyncHttpClient.builder() 
                      .postQuantumTlsEnabled(true) 
                      .build();
            // Create the AWS KMS async client
            KmsAsyncClient kmsAsync = KmsAsyncClient.builder() 
                     .httpClient(awsCrtHttpClient) 
                     .build();
      3.  Test your AWS KMS calls with hybrid post-quantum TLS.
          When you call AWS KMS API operations on the conﬁgured AWS KMS client, your calls 
          are transmitted to the AWS KMS endpoint using hybrid post-quantum TLS. To test your 
          conﬁguration, call an AWS KMS API, such as ListKeys.
            ListKeysReponse keys = kmsAsync.listKeys().get();
      Test your hybrid post-quantum TLS conﬁguration
      Consider running the following tests with hybrid cipher suites on your applications that call AWS 
      KMS.
      • Run load tests and benchmarks. The hybrid cipher suites perform diﬀerently than traditional 
        key exchange algorithms. You might need to adjust your connection timeouts to allow for the 
        longer handshake times. If you’re running inside an AWS Lambda function, extend the execution 
        timeout setting.
      • Try connecting from diﬀerent locations. Depending on the network path your request takes, 
        you might discover that intermediate hosts, proxies, or ﬁrewalls with deep packet inspection 
        (DPI) block the request. This might result from using the new cipher suites in the ClientHello
        part of the TLS handshake, or from the larger key exchange messages. If you have trouble 
      Conﬁgure hybrid post-quantum TLS                                                         11

        resolving these issues, work with your security team or IT administrators to update the relevant 
        conﬁguration and unblock the new TLS cipher suites.

      Connect to AWS KMS through a VPC endpoint
      You can connect directly to AWS KMS through a private interface endpoint in your virtual private 
      cloud (VPC). When you use an interface VPC endpoint, communication between your VPC and AWS 
      KMS is conducted entirely within the AWS network.
      AWS KMS supports Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints powered by AWS 
      PrivateLink. Each VPC endpoint is represented by one or more Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) 
      with private IP addresses in your VPC subnets.
      The interface VPC endpoint connects your VPC directly to AWS KMS without an internet gateway, 
      NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. The instances in your VPC do not 
      need public IP addresses to communicate with AWS KMS.
      Regions
         AWS KMS supports VPC endpoints and VPC endpoint policies in all AWS Regions in which AWS 
         KMS is supported.

      Considerations for AWS KMS VPC endpoints
         Before you set up an interface VPC endpoint for AWS KMS, review the Interface endpoint 
         properties and limitations topic in the AWS PrivateLink Guide.
         AWS KMS support for a VPC endpoint includes the following.
         • You can use your VPC endpoint to call all AWS KMS API operations from your VPC.
         • You can create an interface VPC endpoint that connects to an AWS KMS region endpoint or 
           an AWS KMS FIPS endpoint.
         • You can use AWS CloudTrail logs to audit your use of KMS keys through the VPC endpoint. For 
           details, see Logging AWS KMS requests that use a VPC endpoint.
      Topics
      • Create a VPC endpoint for AWS KMS
      • Connect to an AWS KMS VPC endpoint
      • Use VPC endpoints to control access to AWS KMS resources
      • Logging AWS KMS requests that use a VPC endpoint
      Create a VPC endpoint for AWS KMS
      You can create a VPC endpoint for AWS KMS by using the Amazon VPC console or the Amazon VPC 
      API. Follow the procedures to Create an interface endpoint using one of the following values.
      • To create a VPC endpoint for AWS KMS, use the following service name:
          com.amazonaws.region.kms
        For example, in the US West (Oregon) Region (us-west-2), the service name would be:
          com.amazonaws.us-west-2.kms
      • To create a VPC endpoint that connects to an AWS KMS FIPS endpoint, use the following service 
        name:
          com.amazonaws.region.kms-fips
      Create a VPC endpoint for AWS KMS                                                        13
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
        For example, in the US West (Oregon) Region (us-west-2), the service name would be:
          com.amazonaws.us-west-2.kms-fips
      To make it easier to use the VPC endpoint, you can enable a private DNS name for your VPC 
      endpoint. If you select the Enable DNS Name option, the standard AWS KMS DNS hostname 
      resolves to your VPC endpoint. For example, https://kms.us-west-2.amazonaws.com would 
      resolve to a VPC endpoint connected to service name com.amazonaws.us-west-2.kms.
      This option makes it easier to use the VPC endpoint. The AWS SDKs and AWS CLI use the standard 
      AWS KMS DNS hostname by default, so you do not need to specify the VPC endpoint URL in 
      applications and commands.
      For more information, see Accessing a service through an interface endpoint in the AWS PrivateLink 
      Guide.
      Connect to an AWS KMS VPC endpoint
      You can connect to AWS KMS through the VPC endpoint by using an AWS SDK, the AWS CLI, or 
      AWS Tools for PowerShell. To specify the VPC endpoint, use its DNS name.
      For example, this list-keys command uses the endpoint-url parameter to specify the VPC 
      endpoint. To use a command like this, replace the example VPC endpoint ID with one in your 
      account.
        $ aws kms list-keys --endpoint-url https://vpce-1234abcdf5678c90a-09p7654s-us-
        east-1a.ec2.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com
      Required permissions
         For an AWS KMS request that uses a VPC endpoint to be successful, the principal requires 
         permissions from two sources:
         • A key policy, IAM policy, or grant must give principal permission to call the operation on the 
           resource (KMS key or alias).
         • A VPC endpoint policy must give the principal permission to use the endpoint to make the 
           request.
      Connect to a VPC endpoint                                                                14
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
         For example, a key policy might give a principal permission to call Decrypt on a particular KMS 
         key. However, the VPC endpoint policy might not allow that principal to call Decrypt on that 
         KMS key by using the endpoint.
         Or a VPC endpoint policy might allow a principal to use the endpoint to call DisableKey on 
         certain KMS keys. But if the principal doesn't have those permissions from a key policy, IAM 
         policy, or grant, the request fails.
         You can create a VPC endpoint policy when you create your endpoint, and you can change the 
         VPC endpoint policy at any time. Use the VPC management console, or the CreateVpcEndpoint
         or ModifyVpcEndpoint operations. You can also create and change a VPC endpoint policy by
         using an AWS CloudFormation template. For help using the VPC management console, see
         Create an interface endpoint and Modifying an interface endpoint in the AWS PrivateLink Guide.
      Private hostnames
         If you enabled private hostnames when you created your VPC endpoint, you do not need 
         to specify the VPC endpoint URL in your CLI commands or application conﬁguration. The 
         standard AWS KMS DNS hostname resolves to your VPC endpoint. The AWS CLI and SDKs use 
         this hostname by default, so you can begin using the VPC endpoint to connect to an AWS KMS 
         regional endpoint without changing anything in your scripts and applications.
         To use private hostnames, the enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport attributes of 
         your VPC must be set to true. To set these attributes, use the ModifyVpcAttribute operation. 
         For details, see View and update DNS attributes for your VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
      Use VPC endpoints to control access to AWS KMS resources
      You can control access to AWS KMS resources and operations when the request comes from VPC or 
      uses a VPC endpoint. To do so, use one of the following global condition keys in a key policy or IAM 
      policy.
      •
        Use the aws:sourceVpce condition key to grant or restrict access based on the VPC endpoint.
      •
        Use the aws:sourceVpc condition key to grant or restrict access based on the VPC that hosts 
        the private endpoint.
      Use VPC endpoints to control access to AWS KMS resources                                15
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
           Note
           Use caution when creating key policies and IAM policies based on your VPC endpoint. If 
           a policy statement requires that requests come from a particular VPC or VPC endpoint, 
           requests from integrated AWS services that use an AWS KMS resource on your behalf might 
           fail. For help, see Using VPC endpoint conditions in policies with AWS KMS permissions.
           Also, the aws:sourceIP condition key is not eﬀective when the request comes from an
           Amazon VPC endpoint. To restrict requests to a VPC endpoint, use the aws:sourceVpce
           or aws:sourceVpc condition keys. For more information, see Identity and access 
           management for VPC endpoints and VPC endpoint services in the AWS PrivateLink Guide.
      You can use these global condition keys to control access to AWS KMS keys (KMS keys), aliases, and 
      to operations like CreateKey that don't depend on any particular resource.
      For example, the following sample key policy allows a user to perform some cryptographic 
      operations with a KMS key only when the request uses the speciﬁed VPC endpoint. When a 
      user makes a request to AWS KMS, the VPC endpoint ID in the request is compared to the
      aws:sourceVpce condition key value in the policy. If they do not match, the request is denied.
      To use a policy like this one, replace the placeholder AWS account ID and VPC endpoint IDs with 
      valid values for your account.

                } 
            ]
        }
      You can also use the aws:sourceVpc condition key to restrict access to your KMS keys based on 
      the VPC in which VPC endpoint resides.
      The following sample key policy allows commands that manage the KMS key only when they come 
      from vpc-12345678. In addition, it allows commands that use the KMS key for cryptographic 
      operations only when they come from vpc-2b2b2b2b. You might use a policy like this one if an 
      application is running in one VPC, but you use a second, isolated VPC for management functions.
      To use a policy like this one, replace the placeholder AWS account ID and VPC endpoint IDs with 
      valid values for your account.

      Logging AWS KMS requests that use a VPC endpoint
      AWS CloudTrail logs all operations that use the VPC endpoint. When a request to AWS KMS uses 
      a VPC endpoint, the VPC endpoint ID appears in the AWS CloudTrail log entry that records the 
      request. You can use the endpoint ID to audit the use of your AWS KMS VPC endpoint.
      However, your CloudTrail logs don't include operations requested by principals in other accounts or 
      requests for AWS KMS operations on KMS keys and aliases in other accounts. Also, to protect your 
      VPC, requests that are denied by a VPC endpoint policy, but otherwise would have been allowed, 
      are not recorded in AWS CloudTrail.
      For example, this sample log entry records a GenerateDataKey request that used the VPC endpoint. 
      The vpcEndpointId ﬁeld appears at the end of the log entry.

      Dual-stack endpoint support
      AWS KMS provides a dual-stack public endpoint that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 clients. A dual-
      stack endpoint enables clients to communicate with AWS KMS using either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. 
      For more information on the AWS KMS endpoints, see AWS Key Management Service endpoints 
      and quotas.

      The AWS KMS dual-stack public endpoint at https://kms.your-region.api.aws supports 
      both IPv4 and IPv6 clients. AWS KMS is also privately accessible over IPv4 and IPv6 from your 
      virtual private cloud (VPC) using AWS PrivateLink. For more information about creating private 
      interface VPC endpoints for AWS KMS, see Connect to AWS KMS through a VPC endpoint.
      For more information about IPv6 addressing for your VPCs, see How Amazon VPC works in the
      Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide. For more information about how to conﬁgure your VPC 
      for dual-stack mode, see IP addressing for your VPCs and subnets in the Amazon Virtual Private 
      Cloud User Guide.
      Features not available over IPv6
      AWS KMS cannot communicate over IPv6 with AWS CloudHSM key stores or External key stores. 
      This limitation does not prevent you from calling AWS KMS APIs over IPv6.

     AWS KMS concepts
     Learn the basic terms and concepts used in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and how 
     they work together to help protect your data.
     Introduction to AWS KMS
     AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) provides a web interface to generate and manage 
     cryptographic keys and operates as a cryptographic service provider for protecting data. AWS KMS 
     oﬀers traditional key management services integrated with AWS services to provide a consistent 
     view of customers’ keys across AWS, with centralized management and auditing.
     AWS KMS includes a web interface through the AWS Management Console, command line 
     interface, and RESTful API operations to request cryptographic operations of a distributed ﬂeet 
     of FIPS 140-3 validated hardware security modules (HSMs). The AWS KMS HSM is a multichip 
     standalone hardware cryptographic appliance designed to provide dedicated cryptographic 
     functions to meet the security and scalability requirements of AWS KMS. You can establish your 
     own HSM-based cryptographic hierarchy under keys that you manage as AWS KMS keys. These 
     keys are made available only on the HSMs and only in memory for the necessary time needed to 
     process your cryptographic request. You can create multiple KMS keys, each represented by its key 
     ID. Only under AWS IAM roles and accounts administered by each customer can customer managed 
     KMS keys be created, deleted, or used to encrypt, decrypt, sign, or verify data. You can deﬁne 
     access controls on who can manage and/or use KMS keys by creating a policy that is attached 
     to the key. Such policies allow you to deﬁne application-speciﬁc uses for your keys for each API 
     operation.
     In addition, most AWS services support encryption of data at rest using KMS keys. This capability 
     allows customers to control how and when AWS services can access encrypted data by controlling 
     how and when KMS keys can be accessed.
     Introduction                                                       21
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     AWS KMS is a tiered service consisting of web-facing AWS KMS hosts and a tier of HSMs. The 
     grouping of these tiered hosts forms the AWS KMS stack. All requests to AWS KMS must be 
     made over the Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS) and terminate on an AWS KMS host. AWS 
     KMS hosts only allow TLS with a ciphersuite that provides perfect forward secrecy. AWS KMS 
     authenticates and authorizes your requests using the same credential and policy mechanisms of 
     AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) that are available for all other AWS API operations.
     AWS KMS design goals
     AWS KMS is designed to meet the following requirements.
     Durability
       The durability of cryptographic keys is designed to equal that of the highest durability 
       services in AWS. A single cryptographic key can encrypt large volumes of your data that has 
       accumulated over a long time.
     Design goals                                                       22
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
      Trustworthy
         Use of keys is protected by access control policies that you deﬁne and manage. There is no 
         mechanism to export plaintext KMS keys. The conﬁdentiality of your cryptographic keys is 
         crucial. Multiple Amazon employees with role-speciﬁc access to quorum-based access controls 
         are required to perform administrative actions on the HSMs.
      Low-latency and high throughput
         AWS KMS provides cryptographic operations at latency and throughput levels suitable for use 
         by other services in AWS.
      Independent Regions
         AWS provides independent Regions for customers who need to restrict data access in diﬀerent 
         Regions. Key usage can be isolated within an AWS Region.
      Secure source of random numbers
         Because strong cryptography depends on truly unpredictable random number generation, AWS 
         KMS provides a high-quality and validated source of random numbers.
      Audit
         AWS KMS records the use and management of cryptographic keys in AWS CloudTrail logs. You 
         can use AWS CloudTrail logs to inspect use of your cryptographic keys, including the use of keys 
         by AWS services on your behalf.
      To achieve these goals, the AWS KMS system includes a set of AWS KMS operators and service 
      host operators (collectively, “operators”) that administer “domains.” A domain is a Regionally 
      deﬁned set of AWS KMS servers, HSMs, and operators. Each AWS KMS operator has a hardware 
      token that contains a private and public key pair that is used to authenticate its actions. The HSMs 
      have an additional private and public key pair to establish encryption keys that protect HSM state 
      synchronization.
      AWS KMS keys
      The KMS keys that you create and manage for use in your own cryptographic applications are of a 
      type known as customer managed keys. Customer managed keys can also be used in conjunction 
      with AWS services that use KMS keys to encrypt the data the service stores on your behalf. 
      AWS KMS keys                                                                           23
       AWS Key Management Service                                                                   Developer Guide
       Customer managed keys are recommended for customers who want full control over the lifecycle 
       and usage of their keys. There is a monthly cost to have a customer managed key in your account. 
       In addition, requests use and/or manage the key incur a usage cost. See AWS Key Management 
       Service Pricing for more details.
       There are cases where a customer might want an AWS service to encrypt their data, but they don’t 
       want the overhead of managing keys and don’t want to pay for a key. An AWS managed key is a 
       KMS key that exists in your account, but can only be used under certain circumstances. Speciﬁcally, 
       it can only be used in the context of the AWS service you’re operating in and it can only be used by 
       principals within the account that the key exists. You cannot manage anything about the lifecycle 
       or permissions of these keys. As you use encryption features in AWS services, you may see AWS 
       managed keys; they use an alias of the form “aws<service code>”. For example, an aws/ebs key 
       can only be used to encrypt EBS volumes and only for volumes used by IAM principals in the same 
       account as the key. Think of an AWS managed key that is scoped down for use only by users in 
       your account for resources in your account. You cannot share resources encrypted under an AWS 
       managed key with other accounts. While an AWS managed key is free to exist in your account, you 
       are charged for any use of this key type by the AWS service that is assigned to the key.
       AWS managed keys are a legacy key type that is no longer being created for new AWS services as 
       of 2021. Instead, new (and legacy) AWS services are using what’s known as an AWS owned key to 
       encrypt customer data by default. An AWS owned key is a KMS key that is in an account managed 
       by the AWS service, so the service operators have the ability to manage its lifecycle and usage 
       permissions. By using AWS owned keys, AWS services can transparently encrypt your data and 
       allow for easy cross-account or cross-region sharing of data without you needing to worry about 
       key permissions. Use AWS owned keys for encryption-by-default workloads that provide easier, 
       more automated data protection. Because these keys are owned and managed by AWS, you are 
       not charged for their existence or their usage, you cannot change their policies, you cannot audit 
       activities on these keys, and you cannot delete them. Use customer managed keys when control is 
       important, but use AWS owned keys when convenience is most important.

       encrypt your service resources often create keys for you. KMS keys that AWS services create in your 
       AWS account are AWS managed keys. KMS keys that AWS services create in a service account are
       AWS owned keys.

      AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS diﬀer in their support for KMS keys. Some AWS services 
      encrypt your data by default with an AWS owned key or an AWS managed key. Some AWS services 
      support customer managed keys. Other AWS services support all types of KMS keys to allow you 
      the ease of an AWS owned key, the visibility of an AWS managed key, or the control of a customer 
      managed key. For detailed information about the encryption options that an AWS service oﬀers, 
      see the Encryption at Rest topic in the user guide or the developer guide for the service.
      Customer managed keys
      The KMS keys that you create are customer managed keys. Customer managed keys are KMS keys 
      in your AWS account that you create, own, and manage. You have full control over these KMS keys, 
      including establishing and maintaining their key policies, IAM policies, and grants, enabling and 
      disabling them, rotating their cryptographic material, adding tags, creating aliases that refer to the 
      KMS keys, and scheduling the KMS keys for deletion.
      Customer managed keys appear on the Customer managed keys page of the AWS Management 
      Console for AWS KMS. To deﬁnitively identify a customer managed key, use the DescribeKey
      operation. For customer managed keys, the value of the KeyManager ﬁeld of the DescribeKey
      response is CUSTOMER.
      You can use your customer managed key in cryptographic operations and audit usage in AWS 
      CloudTrail logs. In addition, many AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS let you specify a 
      customer managed key to protect the data stored and managed for you.
      Customer managed keys                                                                  26
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Customer managed keys incur a monthly fee and a fee for use in excess of the free tier. They are 
      counted against the AWS KMS quotas for your account. For details, see AWS Key Management 
      Service Pricing and Quotas.
      AWS managed keys
      AWS managed keys are KMS keys in your account that are created, managed, and used on your 
      behalf by an AWS service integrated with AWS KMS.
      Some AWS services let you choose an AWS managed key or a customer managed key to protect 
      your resources in that service. In general, unless you are required to control the encryption key 
      that protects your resources, an AWS managed key is a good choice. You don't have to create or 
      maintain the key or its key policy, and there's never a monthly fee for an AWS managed key.
      You have permission to view the AWS managed keys in your account, view their key policies, 
      and audit their use in AWS CloudTrail logs. However, you cannot change any properties of AWS 
      managed keys, rotate them, change their key policies, or schedule them for deletion. And, you 
      cannot use AWS managed keys in cryptographic operations directly; the service that creates them 
      uses them on your behalf.
      Resource control policies in your organization do not apply to AWS managed keys.
      AWS managed keys appear on the AWS managed keys page of the AWS Management Console 
      for AWS KMS. You can also identify AWS managed keys by their aliases, which have the format
      aws/service-name, such as aws/redshift. To deﬁnitively identify an AWS managed keys, 
      use the DescribeKey operation. For AWS managed keys, the value of the KeyManager ﬁeld of the
      DescribeKey response is AWS.
      All AWS managed keys are automatically rotated every year. You cannot change this rotation 
      schedule.
           Note
           In May 2022, AWS KMS changed the rotation schedule for AWS managed keys from every 
           three years (approximately 1,095 days) to every year (approximately 365 days).
      There is no monthly fee for AWS managed keys. They can be subject to fees for use in excess of the 
      free tier, but some AWS services cover these costs for you. For details, see the Encryption at Rest

     Service Pricing.
     AWS managed keys do not count against resource quotas on the number of KMS keys in each 
     Region of your account. But when used on behalf of a principal in your account, the KMS keys count 
     against request quotas. For details, see Quotas.
     AWS owned keys
     AWS owned keys are a collection of KMS keys that an AWS service owns and manages for use in 
     multiple AWS accounts. Although AWS owned keys are not in your AWS account, an AWS service 
     can use an AWS owned key to protect the resources in your account.
     Some AWS services let you choose an AWS owned key or a customer managed key. In general, 
     unless you are required to audit or control the encryption key that protects your resources, an AWS 
     owned key is a good choice. AWS owned keys are completely free of charge (no monthly fees or 
     usage fees), they do not count against the AWS KMS quotas for your account, and they're easy to 
     use. You don't need to create or maintain the key or its key policy.
     The rotation of AWS owned keys varies across services. For information about the rotation of a 
     particular AWS owned key, see the Encryption at Rest topic in the user guide or developer guide for 
     the service.
     AWS KMS key hierarchy
     Your key hierarchy starts with a top-level logical key, an AWS KMS key. A KMS key represents a 
     container for top-level key material and is uniquely deﬁned within the AWS service namespace with 
     an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). The ARN includes a uniquely generated key identiﬁer, a key ID. A 
     KMS key is created based on a user-initiated request through AWS KMS. Upon reception, AWS KMS 
     requests the creation of an initial HSM backing key (HBK) to be placed into the KMS key container. 
     The HBK is generated on an HSM in the domain and is designed never to be exported from the 
     HSM in plaintext. Instead, the HBK is exported encrypted under HSM-managed domain keys. These 
     exported HBKs are referred to as exported key tokens (EKTs).
     The EKT is exported to a highly durable, low-latency storage. For example, suppose you receive an 
     ARN to the logical KMS key. This represents the top of a key hierarchy, or cryptographic context, for 
     you. You can create multiple KMS keys within your account and set policies on your KMS keys like 
     any other AWS named resource.
     AWS owned keys                                                     28
       AWS Key Management Service                                                           Developer Guide
       Within the hierarchy of a speciﬁc KMS key, the HBK can be thought of as a version of the KMS key. 
       When you want to rotate the KMS key through AWS KMS, a new HBK is created and associated with 
       the KMS key as the active HBK for the KMS key. The older HBKs are preserved and can be used to 
       decrypt and verify previously protected data. But only the active cryptographic key can be used to 
       protect new information.
       You can make requests through AWS KMS to use your KMS keys to directly protect information 
       or request additional HSM-generated keys that are protected under your KMS key. These keys are 
       called customer data keys, or CDKs. CDKs can be returned encrypted as ciphertext (CT), in plaintext, 
       or both. All objects encrypted under a KMS key (either customer-supplied data or HSM-generated 
       keys) can be decrypted only on an HSM via a call through AWS KMS.
       The returned ciphertext, or the decrypted payload, is never stored within AWS KMS. The 
       information is returned to you over your TLS connection to AWS KMS. This also applies to calls 
       made by AWS services on your behalf.
       The key hierarchy and the speciﬁc key properties appear in the following table.

         AWS KMS might from time to time relax domain key rotation to at most weekly to account for 
       domain administration and conﬁguration tasks.

         Default AWS managed keys created and managed by AWS KMS on your behalf are automatically 
       rotated annually.
       Key identiﬁers (KeyId)
       Key identiﬁers act like names for your KMS keys. They help you to recognize your KMS keys in the 
       console. You use them to indicate which KMS keys you want to use in AWS KMS API operations, 
       key policies, IAM policies, and grants. The key identiﬁer values are completely unrelated to the key 
       material associated with the KMS key.
       AWS KMS deﬁnes several key identiﬁers. When you create a KMS key, AWS KMS generates a 
       key ARN and key ID, which are properties of the KMS key. When you create an alias, AWS KMS 
       Key identiﬁers (KeyId)                                                                       30
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      generates an alias ARN based on the alias name that you deﬁne. You can view the key and alias 
      identiﬁers in the AWS Management Console and in the AWS KMS API.
      In the AWS KMS console, you can view and ﬁlter KMS keys by their key ARN, key ID, or alias name, 
      and sort by key ID and alias name. For help ﬁnding the key identiﬁers in the console, see the 
      section called “Find the key ID and key ARN”.
      In the AWS KMS API, the parameters you use to identify a KMS key are named KeyId or a variation, 
      such as TargetKeyId or DestinationKeyId. However, the values of those parameters are not 
      limited to key IDs. Some can take any valid key identiﬁer. For information about the values for each 
      parameter, see the parameter description in the AWS Key Management Service API Reference.
           Note
           When using the AWS KMS API, be careful about the key identiﬁer that you use. Diﬀerent 
           APIs require diﬀerent key identiﬁers. In general, use the most complete and practical key 
           identiﬁer for your task.
      AWS KMS supports the following key identiﬁers.
      Key ARN
         The key ARN is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key. It is a unique, fully qualiﬁed 
         identiﬁer for the KMS key. A key ARN includes the AWS account, Region, and the key ID. For help 
         ﬁnding the key ARN of a KMS key, see the section called “Find the key ID and key ARN”.
         The format of a key ARN is as follows:
           arn:<partition>:kms:<region>:<account-id>:key/<key-id>
         The following is an example key ARN for a single-Region KMS key.
           arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         The key-id element of the key ARNs of multi-Region keys begin with the mrk- preﬁx. The 
         following is an example key ARN for a multi-Region key.
           arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab
      Key identiﬁers (KeyId)                                                                   31
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Key ID
         The key ID uniquely identiﬁes a KMS key within an account and Region. For help ﬁnding the key 
         ID of a KMS key, see the section called “Find the key ID and key ARN”.
         The following is an example key ID for a single-Region KMS key.
           1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
         The key IDs of multi-Region keys begin with the mrk- preﬁx. The following is an example key ID 
         for a multi-Region key.
           mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab
      Alias ARN
         The alias ARN is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS KMS alias. It is a unique, fully 
         qualiﬁed identiﬁer for the alias, and for the KMS key it represents. An alias ARN includes the 
         AWS account, Region, and the alias name.
         At any given time, an alias ARN identiﬁes one particular KMS key. However, because you can 
         change the KMS key associated with the alias, the alias ARN can identify diﬀerent KMS keys at 
         diﬀerent times. For help ﬁnding the alias ARN of a KMS key, see Find the alias name and alias 
         ARN for a KMS key.
         The format of an alias ARN is as follows:
           arn:<partition>:kms:<region>:<account-id>:alias/<alias-name>
         The following is the alias ARN for a ﬁctitious ExampleAlias.
           arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias
      Alias name
         The alias name is a string of up to 256 characters. It uniquely identiﬁes an associated KMS key 
         within an account and Region. In the AWS KMS API, alias names always begin with alias/. For 
         help ﬁnding the alias name of a KMS key, see Find the alias name and alias ARN for a KMS key.
      Key identiﬁers (KeyId)                                                                   32
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
         The format of an alias name is as follows:
           alias/<alias-name>
         For example:
           alias/ExampleAlias
         The aws/ preﬁx for an alias name is reserved for AWS managed keys. You cannot create an 
         alias with this preﬁx. For example, the alias name of the AWS managed key for Amazon Simple 
         Storage Service (Amazon S3) is the following.
           alias/aws/s3
      Asymmetric keys in AWS KMS
      An asymmetric KMS key represents a mathematically related public key and private key pair. You 
      can give the public key to anyone, even if they're not trusted, but the private key must be kept 
      secret.
      In an asymmetric KMS key, the private key is created in AWS KMS and never leaves AWS KMS 
      unencrypted. To use the private key, you must call AWS KMS. You can use the public key within 
      AWS KMS by calling the AWS KMS API operations. Or, you can download the public key and use it 
      outside of AWS KMS.
      If your use case requires encryption outside of AWS by users who cannot call AWS KMS, asymmetric 
      KMS keys are a good choice. However, if you are creating a KMS key to encrypt the data that you 
      store or manage in an AWS service, use a symmetric encryption KMS key. AWS services that are 
      integrated with AWS KMS use only symmetric encryption KMS keys to encrypt your data. These 
      services do not support encryption with asymmetric KMS keys.
      AWS KMS supports three types of asymmetric KMS keys.
      RSA KMS keys
         A KMS key with an RSA key pair for encryption and decryption or signing and veriﬁcation (but 
         not both). AWS KMS supports several key lengths for diﬀerent security requirements.
      Asymmetric keys                                                                          33

         For technical details about the encryption and signing algorithms that AWS KMS supports for 
         RSA KMS keys, see RSA key specs.
      Elliptic Curve (ECC) KMS keys
         A KMS key with an elliptic curve key pair for signing and veriﬁcation or deriving shared secrets 
         (but not both). AWS KMS supports several commonly-used curves.
         For technical details about the signing algorithms that AWS KMS supports for ECC KMS keys, 
         see Elliptic curve key specs.
      ML-DSA KMS keys
         A KMS key with an ML-DSA key pair for signing and veriﬁcation. ML-DSA is a post-quantum 
         cryptography standard developed by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology 
         (NIST) to protect against the security threats posed by quantum computing. ML-DSA is the 
         recommended digital signature algorithm for organizations transitioning from RSA or Elliptic 
         Curve digital signature algorithms to post-quantum safe cryptography.
         AWS KMS supports several key lengths for diﬀerent security requirements. For technical details

      HMAC keys in AWS KMS
      Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) KMS keys are symmetric keys that you use to 
      generate and verify HMACs within AWS KMS. The unique key material associated with each HMAC 
      KMS key provides the secret key that HMAC algorithms require. You can use an HMAC KMS key 
      with the GenerateMac and VerifyMac operations to verify the integrity and authenticity of data 
      within AWS KMS.
      HMAC algorithms combine a cryptographic hash function and a shared secret key. They take a 
      message and a secret key, such as the key material in an HMAC KMS key, and return a unique, ﬁxed-
      size code or tag. If even one character of the message changes, or if the secret key is not identical, 
      the resulting tag is entirely diﬀerent. By requiring a secret key, HMAC also provides authenticity; 
      it is impossible to generate an identical HMAC tag without the secret key. HMACs are sometimes 
      called symmetric signatures, because they work like digital signatures, but use a single key for both 
      signing and veriﬁcation.
      HMAC KMS keys and the HMAC algorithms that AWS KMS uses conform to industry standards 
      deﬁned in RFC 2104. The AWS KMS GenerateMac operation generates standard HMAC tags. HMAC 
      KMS keys are generated in AWS KMS hardware security modules that are certiﬁed under the FIPS 
      140-3 Cryptographic Module Validation Program (except in China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia) 
      Regions) and never leave AWS KMS unencrypted. To use an HMAC KMS key, you must call AWS 
      KMS.
      You can use HMAC KMS keys to determine the authenticity of a message, such as a JSON Web 
      Token (JWT), tokenized credit card information, or a submitted password. They can also be used as 
      secure Key Derivation Functions (KDFs), especially in applications that require deterministic keys.
      HMAC KMS keys provide an advantage over HMACs from application software because the key 
      material is generated and used entirely within AWS KMS, subject to the access controls that you set 
      on the key.
      HMAC keys                                                                                35
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
           Tip
           Best practices recommend that you limit the time during which any signing mechanism, 
           including an HMAC, is eﬀective. This deters an attack where the actor uses a signed 
           message to establish validity repeatedly or long after the message is superseded. HMAC 
           tags do not include a timestamp, but you can include a timestamp in the token or message 
           to help you detect when its time to refresh the HMAC.
      Supported cryptographic operations
         HMAC KMS keys support only the GenerateMac and VerifyMac cryptographic operations. You 
         cannot use HMAC KMS keys to encrypt data or sign messages, or use any other type of KMS key 
         in HMAC operations. When you use the GenerateMac operation, you supply a message of up 
         to 4,096 bytes, an HMAC KMS key, and the MAC algorithm that is compatible with the HMAC 
         key spec, and GenerateMac computes the HMAC tag. To verify an HMAC tag, you must supply 
         the HMAC tag, and the same message, HMAC KMS key, and MAC algorithm that GenerateMac
         used to compute the original HMAC tag. The VerifyMac operation computes the HMAC tag 
         and veriﬁes that it is identical to the supplied HMAC tag. If the input and computed HMAC tags 
         are not identical, veriﬁcation fails.
         HMAC KMS keys do not support automatic key rotation and you cannot create an HMAC KMS 
         key in a custom key store.
         If you are creating a KMS key to encrypt data in an AWS service, use a symmetric encryption 
         key. You cannot use an HMAC KMS key.

      ML-DSA keys in AWS KMS
      AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) supports Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm 
      (ML-DSA) for post-quantum cryptographic signatures. This implementation follows the Federal 
      Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 204 standard to help protect against future quantum 
      computing threats. AWS KMS creates and protects all ML-DSA keys and signature operations 
      in FIPS 140-3 Security Level 3 validated hardware security modules. To help balance security 
      with performance, ML-DSA in AWS KMS oﬀers three distinct security levels through diﬀerent key 
      speciﬁcations, ML_DSA_44, ML_DSA_65, and ML_DSA_87.
      AWS KMS supports asymmetric key signatures for messages up to 4 KB using the RAW message 
      type. For larger messages, you must externally compute the 64-byte message representation μ 
      used in ML-DSA signing as deﬁned in NIST FIPS 204 section 6.2. Use the EXTERNAL_MU message 
      type in the AWS KMS Sign operation to specify this pre-processed 64-byte message. The signatures 
      produced by the externally computed μ are the same as the RAW ones when using the same 
      message and private key. Note that this signing is diﬀerent from the "pre-hash" ML-DSA or 
      HashML-DSA from section 5.4 of NIST FIPS 204.
      For more information about using ML-DSA and the EXTERNAL_MU message type, see ML-DSA key 
      specs.
      For an example of using ML-DSA and the EXTERNAL_MU message type, see Oﬄine veriﬁcation 
      with ML-DSA key pairs.
      Multi-Region keys in AWS KMS
      AWS KMS supports multi-Region keys, which are AWS KMS keys in diﬀerent AWS Regions that 
      can be used interchangeably – as though you had the same key in multiple Regions. Each set of
      related multi-Region keys has the same key material and key ID, so you can encrypt data in one 
      AWS Region and decrypt it in a diﬀerent AWS Region without re-encrypting or making a cross-
      Region call to AWS KMS.
      ML-DSA keys                                                                            37
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
      Like all KMS keys, multi-Region keys never leave AWS KMS unencrypted. You can create symmetric 
      or asymmetric multi-Region keys for encryption or signing, create HMAC multi-Region keys for 
      generating and verifying HMAC tags, and create multi-Region keys with imported key material or 
      key material that AWS KMS generates. You must manage each multi-Region key independently, 
      including creating aliases and tags, setting their key policies and grants, and enabling and disabling 
      them selectively. You can use multi-Region keys in all cryptographic operations that you can do 
      with single-Region keys.
      Multi-Region keys are a ﬂexible and powerful solution for many common data security scenarios.
      Disaster recovery
         In a backup and recovery architecture, multi-Region keys let you process encrypted data 
         without interruption even in the event of an AWS Region outage. Data maintained in backup 
         Regions can be decrypted in the backup Region, and data newly encrypted in the backup 
         Region can be decrypted in the primary Region when that Region is restored.
      Global data management
         Businesses that operate globally need globally distributed data that is available consistently 
         across AWS Regions. You can create multi-Region keys in all Regions where your data resides, 
         then use the keys as though they were a single-Region key without the latency of a cross-
         Region call or the cost of re-encrypting data under a diﬀerent key in each Region.
      Distributed signing applications
         Applications that require cross-Region signature capabilities can use multi-Region asymmetric 
         signing keys to generate identical digital signatures consistently and repeatedly in diﬀerent 
         AWS Regions.
         If you use certiﬁcate chaining with a single global trust store (for a single root certiﬁcate 
         authority (CA), and Regional intermediate CAs signed by the root CA, you don't need multi-
         Region keys. However, if your system doesn't support intermediate CAs, such as application 
         signing, you can use multi-Region keys to bring consistency to Regional certiﬁcations.
      Active-active applications that span multiple Regions
         Some workloads and applications can span multiple Regions in active-active architectures. For 
         these applications, multi-Region keys can reduce complexity by providing the same key material 
         for concurrent encrypt and decrypt operations on data that might be moving across Region 
         boundaries.
      Multi-Region keys                                                                      38
      AWS Key Management Service                                                  Developer Guide
      You can use multi-Region keys with client-side encryption libraries, such as the AWS Encryption 
      SDK, the AWS Database Encryption SDK, and Amazon S3 client-side encryption.
      AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS for encryption at rest or digital signatures currently 
      treat multi-Region keys as though they were single-Region keys. They might re-wrap or re-encrypt 
      data moved between Regions. For example, Amazon S3 cross-region replication decrypts and re-
      encrypts data under a KMS key in the destination Region, even when replicating objects protected 
      by a multi-Region key.
      Multi-Region keys are not global. You create a multi-Region primary key and then replicate it into 
      Regions that you select within an AWS partition. Then you manage the multi-Region key in each 
      Region independently. Neither AWS nor AWS KMS ever automatically creates or replicates multi-
      Region keys into any Region on your behalf. AWS managed keys, the KMS keys that AWS services 
      create in your account for you, are always single-Region keys.
      In China Regions, you can use the multi-Region key feature to replicate KMS keys within the China 
      Regions partition (aws-cn). For example, you can replicate a key from the China (Beijing) Region to 
      the China (Ningxia) Region, or the reverse. By replicating a key from one China region to another, 
      you agree to use the AWS Key Management Service of the destination region and comply with 
      all applicable terms of agreement for the destination region. You cannot replicate a key from the 
      Beijing and Ningxia Regions into an AWS Region outside of the China Regions partition. Similarly, 
      you cannot replicate a key from a region outside of the China Regions partition into the Beijing and 
      Ningxia Regions.
      You cannot convert an existing single-Region key to a multi-Region key. This design ensures that 
      all data protected with existing single-Region keys maintain the same data residency and data 
      sovereignty properties.
      For most data security needs, the Regional isolation and fault tolerance of Regional resources make 
      standard AWS KMS single-Region keys a best-ﬁt solution. However, when you need to encrypt 
      or sign data in client-side applications across multiple Regions, multi-Region keys might be the 
      solution.
      Regions
      Multi-Region keys are supported in all AWS Regions that AWS KMS supports.
      Pricing and quotas
      Multi-Region keys                                                                   39

      Every key in a set of related multi-Region keys counts as one KMS key for pricing and quotas. AWS 
      KMS quotas are calculated separately for each Region of an account. Use and management of the 
      multi-Region keys in each Region count toward the quotas for that Region.
      Supported KMS key types
      You can create the following types of multi-Region KMS keys:
      • Symmetric encryption KMS keys
      • Asymmetric KMS keys
      • HMAC KMS keys
      • KMS keys with imported key material
      You cannot create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.

      Terminology and concepts
      The following terms and concepts are used with multi-Region keys.
      Multi-Region key
      A multi-Region key is one of a set of KMS keys with the same key ID and key material (and other
      shared properties) in diﬀerent AWS Regions. Each multi-Region key is a fully functioning KMS key 
      that can be used entirely independently of its related multi-Region keys. Because all related multi-
      Region keys have the same key ID and key material, they are interoperable, that is, any related 
      multi-Region key in any AWS Region can decrypt ciphertext encrypted by any other related multi-
      Region key.
      Multi-Region keys                                                                        40
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
      You set the multi-Region property of a KMS key when you create it. You cannot change the multi-
      Region property on an existing key. You cannot convert a single-Region key to multi-Region key or 
      a convert a multi-Region key to a single-Region key. To move existing workloads into multi-Region 
      scenarios, you must re-encrypt your data or create new signatures with new multi-Region keys.
      A multi-Region key can be symmetric or asymmetric and it can use AWS KMS key material or
      imported key material. You cannot create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.
      In a set of related multi-Region keys, there is exactly one primary key at any time. You can create
      replica keys of that primary key in other AWS Regions. You can also update the primary region, 
      which changes the primary key to a replica key and changes a speciﬁed replica key to the primary 
      key. However, you can maintain only one primary key or replica key in each AWS Region. All of the 
      Regions must be in the same AWS partition.
      You can have multiple sets of related multi-Region keys in the same or diﬀerent AWS Regions. 
      Although related multi-Region keys are interoperable, unrelated multi-Region keys are not 
      interoperable.
      Primary key
      A multi-Region primary key is a KMS key that can be replicated into other AWS Regions in the same 
      partition. Each set of multi-Region keys has just one primary key.
      A primary key diﬀers from a replica key in the following ways:
      • Only a primary key can be replicated.
      • The primary key is the source for shared properties of its replica keys, including the key material 
        and key ID.
      • You can enable and disable automatic key rotation only on a primary key.
      • You can schedule the deletion of a primary key at any time. But AWS KMS will not delete a 
        primary key until all of its replica keys are deleted.
      However, primary and replica keys don't diﬀer in any cryptographic properties. You can use a 
      primary key and its replica keys interchangeably.
      You are not required to replicate a primary key. You can use it just as you would any KMS key and 
      replicate it if and when it is useful. However, because multi-Region keys have diﬀerent security 
      properties than single-Region keys, we recommend that you create a multi-Region key only when 
      you plan to replicate it.
      Multi-Region keys                                                                      41
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Replica key
      A multi-Region replica key is a KMS key that has the same key ID and key material as its primary key
      and related replica keys, but exists in a diﬀerent AWS Region.
      A replica key is a fully functional KMS key with it own key policy, grants, alias, tags, and other 
      properties. It is not a copy of or pointer to the primary key or any other key. You can use a replica 
      key even if its primary key and all related replica keys are disabled. You can also convert a replica 
      key to a primary key and a primary key to a replica key. Once it is created, a replica key relies on its 
      primary key only for key rotation and updating the primary Region.
      Primary and replica keys don't diﬀer in any cryptographic properties. You can use a primary key 
      and its replica keys interchangeably. Data encrypted by a primary or replica key can be decrypted 
      by the same key, or by any related primary or replica key.
      Replicate
      You can replicate a multi-Region primary key into a diﬀerent AWS Region in the same partition. 
      When you do, AWS KMS creates a multi-Region replica key in the speciﬁed Region with the same
      key ID and other shared properties as its primary key. Then it securely transports the key material 
      across the Region boundary and associates it with the new replica key, all within AWS KMS.
      Shared properties
      Shared properties are properties of a multi-Region primary key that are shared with its replica keys. 
      AWS KMS creates the replica keys with the same shared property values as those of the primary 
      key. Then, it periodically synchronizes the shared property values of the primary key to its replica 
      keys. You cannot set these properties on a replica key.
      The following are the shared properties of multi-Region keys.
      •
        Key ID — (The Region element of the key ARN diﬀers.)
      • Key material
      • Key material origin
      • Key spec and encryption algorithms
      • Key usage
      • Automatic key rotation — You can enable and disable automatic key rotation only on the 
        primary key. New replica keys are created with all versions of the shared key material. For details, 
        see Rotating multi-Region keys.
      Multi-Region keys                                                                        42
      AWS Key Management Service                                              Developer Guide
      • On-demand rotation — You can perform on-demand rotation only on the primary key. New 
        replica keys are created with all versions of the shared key material. For details, see Rotating 
        multi-Region keys.
      You can also think of the primary and replica designations of related multi-Region keys as shared 
      properties. When you create new replica keys or update the primary key, AWS KMS synchronizes 
      the change to all related multi-Region keys. When these changes are complete, all related multi-
      Region keys list their primary key and replica keys accurately.
      All other properties of multi-Region keys are independent properties, including the description, key 
      policy, grants, enabled and disabled key states, aliases, and tags. You can set the same values for 
      these properties on all related multi-Region keys, but if you change the value of an independent 
      property, AWS KMS does not synchronize it.
      You can track the synchronization of the shared properties of your multi-Region keys. In your AWS 
      CloudTrail log, look for the SynchronizeMultiRegionKey event.
      Security considerations for multi-Region keys
      Use an AWS KMS multi-Region key only when you need one. Multi-Region keys provide a ﬂexible 
      and scalable solution for workloads that move encrypted data between AWS Regions or need 
      cross-Region access. Consider a multi-Region key if you must share, move, or back up protected 
      data across Regions or need to create identical digital signatures of applications operating in 
      diﬀerent Regions.
      However, the process of creating a multi-Region key moves your key material across AWS 
      Region boundaries within AWS KMS. The ciphertext generated by a multi-Region key can 
      potentially be decrypted by multiple related keys in multiple geographic locations. There are also 
      signiﬁcant beneﬁts to Regionally-isolated services and resources. Each AWS Region is isolated and 
      independent of the other Regions. Regions provide fault tolerance, stability, and resilience, and 
      can also reduce latency. They enable you to create redundant resources that remain available and 
      unaﬀected by an outage in another Region. In AWS KMS, they also ensure that every ciphertext can 
      be decrypted by only one key.
      Multi-Region keys also raise new security considerations:
      • Controlling access and enforcing data security policy is more complex with multi-Region keys. 
        You need to ensure that policy is audited consistently on key across multiple, isolated regions. 
        And you need to use policy to enforce boundaries, instead of relying on separate keys.
      Multi-Region keys                                                               43
     AWS Key Management Service                                        Developer Guide
       For example, you need to set policy conditions on data to prevent payroll teams in one Region 
       from being able to read payroll data for a diﬀerent Region. Also, you must use access control 
       to prevent a scenario where a multi-Region key in one Region protects one tenant's data and a 
       related multi-Region key in another Region protects a diﬀerent tenant's data.
     • Auditing keys across Regions is also more complex. With multi-Region keys, you need to examine 
       and reconcile audit activities across multiple Regions to gain a complete understanding of key 
       activities on protected data.
     • Compliance with data residency mandates can be more complex. With isolated Regions, you 
       can ensure data residency and data sovereignty compliance. KMS keys in a given Region can 
       decrypt sensitive data only in that Region. Data encrypted in one Region can remain completely 
       protected and inaccessible in any other Region.
       To verify data residency and data sovereignty with multi-Region keys, you need to implement 
       access policies and compile AWS CloudTrail events across multiple Regions.
     To make it easier for you to manage access control on multi-Region keys, the permission to 
     replicate a multi-Region key (kms:ReplicateKey) is separate from the standard permission to create 
     keys (kms:CreateKey). Also, AWS KMS supports several policy conditions for multi-Region keys, 
     including kms:MultiRegion, which allows or denies permission to create, use, or manage multi-
     Region keys and kms:ReplicaRegion, which restricts the Regions into which a multi-Region key 
     can be replicated. For details, see Control access to multi-Region keys.
     How multi-Region keys work
     You begin by creating a symmetric or asymmetric multi-Region primary key in an AWS Region 
     that AWS KMS supports, such as US East (N. Virginia). You decide whether a key is single-Region 
     or multi-Region only when you create it; you can't change this property later. As with any KMS 
     key, you set a key policy for the multi-Region key, and you can create grants, and add aliases and 
     tags for categorization and authorization. (These are independent properties that aren't shared 
     or synchronized with other keys.) You can use your multi-Region primary key in cryptographic 
     operations for encryption or signing.
     You can create a multi-Region primary key in the AWS KMS console or by using the CreateKey API 
     with the MultiRegion parameter set to true. Notice that multi-Region keys have a distinctive key 
     ID that begins with mrk-. You can use the mrk- preﬁx to identify MRKs programmatically.
     Multi-Region keys                                                        44
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     If you choose, you can replicate the multi-Region primary key into one or more diﬀerent AWS 
     Regions in the same AWS partition, such as Europe (Ireland). When you do, AWS KMS creates a
     replica key in the speciﬁed Region with the same key ID and other shared properties as the primary 
     key. Then it securely transports the key material across the Region boundary and associates it with 
     the new KMS key in the destination Region, all within AWS KMS. The result is two related multi-
     Region keys — a primary key and a replica key — that can be used interchangeably.
     You can create a multi-Region replica key in the AWS KMS console or by using the ReplicateKey API.
     The resulting multi-Region replica key is a fully-functional KMS key with the same shared 
     properties as the primary key. In all other respects, it is an independent KMS key with its own 
     description, key policy, grants, aliases, and tags. Enabling or disabling a multi-Region key has no 
     eﬀect on related multi-Region keys. You can use the primary and replica keys independently in 
     cryptographic operations or coordinate their use. For example, you can encrypt data with the 
     primary key in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, move the data to the Europe (Ireland) Region and 
     use the replica key to decrypt the data.
     Related multi-Region keys have the same key ID. Their key ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) diﬀer 
     only in the Region ﬁeld. For example, the multi-Region primary key and replica keys might have the 
     following example key ARNs. The key ID – the last element in the key ARN – is identical. Both keys 
     have the distinctive key ID of multi-Region keys, which begins with mrk-.
     Multi-Region keys                                                  45
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
        Primary key: arn:aws:kms:us-
        east-1:111122223333:key/mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef12345678990ab
        Replica key: arn:aws:kms:eu-
        west-1:111122223333:key/mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef12345678990ab
      Having the same key ID is required for interoperability. When encrypting, AWS KMS binds the 
      key ID of the KMS key to the ciphertext so the ciphertext can be decrypted only with that KMS 
      key or a KMS key with the same key ID. This feature also makes related multi-Region keys easy to 
      recognize, and it makes it easier to use them interchangeably. For example, when using them in an 
      application, you can refer to related multi-Region keys by their shared key ID. Then, if necessary, 
      specify the Region or ARN to distinguish them.
      As your data needs change, you can replicate the primary key to other AWS Regions in the same 
      partition, such as US West (Oregon) and Asia Paciﬁc (Sydney). The result is four related multi-
      Region keys with the same key material and key IDs, as shown in the following diagram. You 
      manage the keys independently. You can use them independently or in a coordinated fashion. For 
      example, you can encrypt data with the replica key in Asia Paciﬁc (Sydney), move the data to US 
      West (Oregon), and decrypt it with the replica key in US West (Oregon).
      Multi-Region keys                                                                        46

     Other considerations for multi-Region keys include the following.
     Synchronizing shared properties — If a shared property of the multi-Region keys changes, AWS KMS 
     automatically synchronizes the change from the primary key to all of its replica keys. You cannot 
     request or force a synchronization of shared properties. AWS KMS detects and synchronizes all 
     changes for you. However, you can audit synchronization by using the SynchronizeMultiRegionKey
     event in CloudTrail logs.
     For example, if you enable automatic key rotation on a symmetric multi-Region primary key, AWS 
     KMS copies that setting to all of its replica keys. When the key material is rotated, the rotation 
     is synchronized among all of the related multi-Region keys, so they continue to have the same 
     current key material, and access to all older versions of the key material. If you create a new replica 
     key, it has the same current key material of all related multi-Region keys and access to all previous 
     versions of the key material. For details, see Rotating multi-Region keys.
     Changing the primary key — Every set of multi-Region keys must have exactly one primary key. The
     primary key is the only key that can be replicated. It's also the source of the shared properties of 
     Multi-Region keys                                                  47
      AWS Key Management Service                                             Developer Guide
      its replica keys. But you can change the primary key to a replica and promote one of the replica 
      keys to primary. You might do this so you can delete a multi-Region primary key from a particular 
      Region, or locate the primary key in a Region closer to project administrators. For details, see
      Change the primary key in a set of multi-Region keys.
      Deleting multi-Region keys — Like all KMS keys, you must schedule the deletion of multi-Region 
      keys before AWS KMS deletes them. While the key is pending deletion, you cannot use it in any 
      cryptographic operations. However, AWS KMS will not delete a multi-Region primary key until all 
      of its replica keys are deleted. For details, see Deleting multi-Region keys.
      Importing key material for AWS KMS keys
      You can create an AWS KMS keys (KMS key) with key material that you supply.
      A KMS key is a logical representation of a data key. The metadata for a KMS key includes the ID of 
      the key material used to perform cryptographic operations. When you create a KMS key, by default, 
      AWS KMS generates the key material for that KMS key. But you can create a KMS key without key 
      material and then import your own key material into that KMS key, a feature often known as "bring 
      your own key" (BYOK).
          Note
          AWS KMS does not support decrypting any AWS KMS ciphertext encrypted by a symmetric 
          encryption KMS key outside of AWS KMS, even if the ciphertext was encrypted under a KMS 
          key with imported key material. AWS KMS does not publish the ciphertext format this task 
          requires, and the format might change without notice.
      When you use imported key material, you remain responsible for the key material while allowing 
      AWS KMS to use a copy of it. You might choose to do this for one or more of the following reasons:
      Imported key material                                                          48

      • To prove the key material was generated using a source of entropy that meets your 
        requirements.
      • To use key material from your own infrastructure with AWS services, and to use AWS KMS to 
        manage the lifecycle of that key material within AWS.
      • To use existing, well-established keys in AWS KMS, such as keys for code signing, PKI certiﬁcate 
        signing, and certiﬁcate pinned applications
      • To set an expiration time for the key material in AWS and to manually delete it, but to also make 
        it available again in the future. In contrast, scheduling key deletion requires a waiting period of 7 
        to 30 days, after which you cannot recover the deleted KMS key.
      • To own the original copy of the key material, and to keep it outside of AWS for additional 
        durability and disaster recovery during the complete lifecycle of the key material.
      • For asymmetric keys and HMAC keys, importing creates compatible and interoperable keys that 
        operate within and outside of AWS.
      Supported KMS key types
      AWS KMS supports imported key material for the following types of KMS keys. You cannot import 
      key material into KMS keys in custom key stores.
      • Symmetric encryption KMS keys
      • Asymmetric KMS keys (except ML-DSA keys)
      • HMAC KMS keys
      • Multi-Region keys of all supported types.
      Regions
      Imported key material is supported in all AWS Regions that AWS KMS supports.
      In China Regions, the key material requirements for symmetric encryption KMS keys diﬀer from 
      other Regions. For details, see Step 3: Encrypt the key material.

      Special considerations for imported key material
      Before you decide to import key material into AWS KMS, you should understand the following 
      characteristics of imported key material.
      You generate the key material
         You are responsible for generating the key material using a source of randomness that meets 
         your security requirements.
      You're responsible for availability and durability
         AWS KMS is designed to keep imported key material highly available. But AWS KMS does not 
         maintain the durability of imported key material at the same level as key material that AWS 
         KMS generates. For details, see Protecting imported key material.
      You can delete the key material
         You can delete imported key material from a KMS key, immediately rendering the KMS key 
         unusable. Also, when you import key material into a KMS key, you can determine whether the 
         key expires and set its expiration time. When the expiration time arrives, AWS KMS deletes the 
         key material. Without key material, the KMS key cannot be used in any cryptographic operation. 
         To restore the key, you must reimport the same key material into the key.
      You cannot change the key material for asymmetric, HMAC, and multi-Region keys
         When you import key material into a KMS key, the KMS key is permanently associated with 
         that key material. You can reimport the same key material, but you cannot import diﬀerent 
         key material into that KMS key. Also, you cannot enable automatic key rotation for a KMS key 
         with imported key material. However, you can manually rotate a KMS key with imported key 
         material.
      Imported key material                                                           50
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      You can perform on-demand rotation on single-Region, symmetric encryption keys
         Single-Region symmetric encryption keys with imported key material support on-demand 
         rotation. You can import multiple key materials  into these keys and use on-demand rotation
         to update the current key material. The current key material is used for both encryption and 
         decryption but other (non-current) key materials can only be used for decryption.
      You cannot change the key material origin
         KMS keys designed for imported key material have an origin value of EXTERNAL that cannot be 
         changed. You cannot convert a KMS key for imported key material to use key material from any 
         other source, including AWS KMS. Similarly, you cannot convert a KMS key with AWS KMS key 
         material into one designed for imported key material.
      You cannot export key material
         You cannot export any key material that you imported. AWS KMS cannot return the imported 
         key material to you in any form. You must maintain a copy of your imported key material 
         outside of AWS, preferably in a key manager, such as a hardware security module (HSM), so you 
         can reimport the key material if you delete it or it expires.
      You can create multi-Region keys with imported key material
         Multi-Region with imported key material have the features of KMS keys with imported key 
         material, and can interoperate between AWS Regions. To create a multi-Region key with 
         imported key material, you must import the same key material into the primary KMS key and 
         into each replica key. Multi-Region symmetric encryption keys do not support on-demand 
         rotation.
      Asymmetric keys and HMAC keys are portable and interoperable
         You can use your asymmetric key material and HMAC key material outside of AWS to 
         interoperate with AWS KMS keys with the same imported key material.
         Unlike the AWS KMS symmetric ciphertext, which is inextricably bound to the KMS key used in 
         the algorithm, AWS KMS uses standard HMAC and asymmetric formats for encryption, signing, 
         and MAC generation. As a result, the keys are portable and support traditional escrow key 
         scenarios.
         When your KMS key has imported key material, you can use the imported key material outside 
         of AWS to perform the following operations.
      Imported key material                                                                    51
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
       • HMAC keys — You can verify a HMAC tag that was generated by the HMAC KMS key with 
         imported key material. You can also use the HMAC KMS key with the imported key material to 
         verify an HMAC tag that was generated by the key material outside of AWS.
       • Asymmetric encryption keys — You can use your private asymmetric encryption key outside 
         of AWS to decrypt a ciphertext encrypted by the KMS key with the corresponding public key. 
         You can also use your asymmetric KMS key to decrypt an asymmetric ciphertext that was 
         generated outside of AWS.
       • Asymmetric signing keys — You can use your asymmetric signing KMS key with imported key 
         material to verify digital signatures generated by your private signing key outside of AWS. 
         You can also use your asymmetric public signing key outside of AWS to verify signatures 
         generated by your asymmetric KMS key.
       • Asymmetric key agreement keys — You can use your asymmetric key agreement KMS key 
         with imported key material to derive shared secrets with a peer outside of AWS.
       If you import the same key material into diﬀerent KMS keys in the same AWS Region, those 
       keys are also interoperable. To create interoperable KMS keys in diﬀerent AWS Regions, create a 
       multi-Region key with imported key material.
     Symmetric encryption keys are not portable or interoperable
       The symmetric ciphertexts that AWS KMS produces are not portable or interoperable. AWS 
       KMS does not publish the symmetric ciphertext format that portability requires, and the format 
       might change without notice.
       • AWS KMS cannot decrypt symmetric ciphertexts that you encrypt outside of AWS, even if you 
         use key material that you have imported.
       • AWS KMS does not support decrypting any AWS KMS symmetric ciphertext outside of AWS 
         KMS, even if the ciphertext was encrypted under a KMS key with imported key material.
       • KMS keys with the same imported key material are not interoperable. The symmetric 
         ciphertext that AWS KMS generates ciphertext that is speciﬁc to each KMS key. This 
         ciphertext format guarantees that only the KMS key that encrypted data can decrypt it.
       Also, you cannot use any AWS tools, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side 
       encryption, to decrypt AWS KMS symmetric ciphertexts.
       As a result, you cannot use keys with imported key material to support key escrow 
       arrangements where an authorized third party with conditional access to key material 
       can decrypt certain ciphertexts outside of AWS KMS. To support key escrow, use the AWS 
       Encryption SDK to encrypt your message under a key that is independent of AWS KMS.
     Imported key material                                              52
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Protecting imported key material
      The key material that you import is protected in transit and at rest. Before importing the key 
      material, you encrypt (or "wrap") the key material with the public key of an RSA key pair generated 
      in AWS KMS hardware security modules (HSMs) validated under the FIPS 140-3 Cryptographic 
      Module Validation Program. You can encrypt the key material directly with the wrapping public 
      key, or encrypt the key material with an AES symmetric key, and then encrypt the AES symmetric 
      key with the RSA public key.
      Upon receipt, AWS KMS decrypts the key material with the corresponding private key in a AWS 
      KMS HSM and re-encrypts it under an AES symmetric key that exists only in the volatile memory of 
      the HSM. Your key material never leaves the HSM in plain text. It is decrypted only while it is in use 
      and only within AWS KMS HSMs.
      Use of your KMS key with imported key material is determined solely by the access control policies
      that you set on the KMS key. In addition, you can use aliases and tags to identify and control access
      to the KMS key. You can enable and disable the key, view, and monitor it using services like AWS 
      CloudTrail.
      However, you maintain the only failsafe copy of your key material. In return for this extra measure 
      of control, you are responsible for durability and overall availability of the imported key material. 
      AWS KMS is designed to keep imported key material highly available. But AWS KMS does not 
      maintain the durability of imported key material at the same level as key material that AWS KMS 
      generates.
      This diﬀerence in durability is meaningful in the following cases:
      • When you set an expiration time for your imported key material, AWS KMS deletes the key 
        material after it expires. AWS KMS does not delete the KMS key or its metadata. You can create 
        a Amazon CloudWatch alarm that notiﬁes you when imported key material is approaching its 
        expiration date.
        You cannot delete key material that AWS KMS generates for a KMS key and you cannot set AWS 
        KMS key material to expire.
      • When you manually delete imported key material, AWS KMS deletes the key material but does 
        not delete the KMS key or its metadata. In contrast, scheduling key deletion requires a waiting 
        period of 7 to 30 days, after which AWS KMS permanently deletes the KMS key, its metadata, 
        and its key material.
      Imported key material                                                                   53
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      • In the unlikely event of certain region-wide failures that aﬀect AWS KMS (such as a total loss of 
        power), AWS KMS cannot automatically restore your imported key material. However, AWS KMS 
        can restore the KMS key and its metadata.
      You must retain a copy of the imported key material outside of AWS in a system that you 
      control. We recommend that you store an exportable copy of the imported key material in a key 
      management system, such as an HSM. As a best practice, you should store a reference to the KMS 
      key ARN and the key material ID generated by AWS KMS alongside the exportable copy of the 
      key material. If your imported key material is deleted or expires, its associated KMS key becomes 
      unusable until you reimport the same key material. If your imported key material is permanently 
      lost, any ciphertext encrypted under the KMS key is unrecoverable.
           Important
           Single-Region, symmetric encryption keys can have multiple key materials associated with 
           them. The entire KMS key becomes unusable as soon as you delete any one of those key 
           materials or if any one of those key materials expires (unless the deleted or expiring key 
           material is PENDING_ROTATION). You must reimport any expired or deleted key materials 
           associated with such a key before the key becomes usable for cryptographic operations.
      KMS keys in a CloudHSM key store
      You can create, view, manage, use, and schedule deletion of the AWS KMS keys in an AWS 
      CloudHSM key store. The procedures that you use are very similar to those you use for other KMS 
      keys. The only diﬀerence is that you specify an AWS CloudHSM key store when you create the KMS 
      key. Then, AWS KMS creates non-extractable key material for the KMS key in the AWS CloudHSM 
      cluster that is associated with the AWS CloudHSM key store. When you use a KMS key in an AWS 
      CloudHSM key store, the cryptographic operations are performed in the HSMs in the cluster.

         • Assign tags and create aliases, and use attribute-based access control (ABAC) to authorize 
           access to the KMS keys.
         • Use the KMS keys to perform the following cryptographic operations:
           • Encrypt
           • Decrypt
           • GenerateDataKey
           • GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
           • ReEncrypt
           The operations that generate asymmetric data key pairs, GenerateDataKeyPair and
           GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext, are not supported in custom key stores.
         • Use the KMS keys with AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS and support customer 
           managed keys.
         • Track use of your KMS keys in AWS CloudTrail logs and Amazon CloudWatch monitoring tools.
      Unsupported features
         • AWS CloudHSM key stores support only symmetric encryption KMS keys. You cannot create 
           HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric KMS keys, or asymmetric data key pairs in an AWS CloudHSM 
           key store.
         • You cannot import key material into a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store. AWS KMS 
           generates the key material for the KMS key in the AWS CloudHSM cluster.
         • You cannot enable or disable automatic rotation of the key material for a KMS key in an AWS 
           CloudHSM key store.
      Using KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store
         When you use your KMS key in a request, identify the KMS key by its ID or alias; you do not need 
         to specify the AWS CloudHSM key store or AWS CloudHSM cluster. The response includes the 
         same ﬁelds that are returned for any symmetric encryption KMS key.
         However, when you use a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store, the cryptographic operation 
         is performed entirely within the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the AWS 
         CloudHSM key store. The operation uses the key material in the cluster that is associated with 
         the KMS key that you chose.
         To make this possible, the following conditions are required.

           The key state of the KMS key must be Enabled. To ﬁnd the key state, use the Status ﬁeld in 
           the AWS KMS console or the KeyState ﬁeld in the DescribeKey response.
         • The AWS CloudHSM key store must be connected to its AWS CloudHSM cluster. Its Status in 
           the AWS KMS console or ConnectionState in the DescribeCustomKeyStores response must 
           be CONNECTED.
         • The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must contain at least 
           one active HSM. To ﬁnd the number of active HSMs in the cluster, use the AWS KMS console, 
           the AWS CloudHSM console, or the DescribeClusters operation.
         • The AWS CloudHSM cluster must contain the key material for the KMS key. If the key material 
           was deleted from the cluster, or an HSM was created from a backup that did not include the 
           key material, the cryptographic operation will fail.
         If these conditions are not met, the cryptographic operation fails, and AWS KMS returns a
         KMSInvalidStateException exception. Typically, you just need to reconnect the AWS 
         CloudHSM key store. For additional help, see How to ﬁx a failing KMS key.
         When using the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store, be aware that the KMS keys in 
         each AWS CloudHSM key store share a custom key store request quota for cryptographic 
         operations. If you exceed the quota, AWS KMS returns a ThrottlingException. If the 
         AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the AWS CloudHSM key store is processing 
         numerous commands, including those unrelated to the AWS CloudHSM key store, you might get 
         a ThrottlingException at an even lower rate. If you get a ThrottlingException for any 
         request, lower your request rate and try the commands again. For details about the custom key 
         store request quota, see Custom key store request quotas.

      KMS keys in external key stores
      To create, view, manage, use, and schedule deletion of the KMS keys in an external key store, 
      you use procedures that are very similar to those you use for other KMS keys. However, when 
      you create a KMS key in an external key store, you specify an external key store and an external 
      key. When you use a KMS key in an external key store, encryption and decryption operations are 
      performed by your external key manager using the speciﬁed external key.
      AWS KMS cannot create, view, update, or delete any cryptographic keys in your external key 
      manager. AWS KMS never directly accesses your external key manager or any external key. All 
      requests for cryptographic operations are mediated by your external key store proxy. To use a KMS 
      key in an external key store, the external key store that hosts the KMS key must be connected to its 
      external key store proxy.
      Supported features
         In addition to the procedures discussed in this section, you can do the following with KMS keys 
         in an external key store:
         • Use key policies, IAM policies, and grants to control access to the KMS keys.
         • Enable and disable the KMS keys. These actions do not aﬀect the external key in your external 
           key manager.
         • Assign tags and create aliases, and use attribute-based access control (ABAC) to authorize 
           access to the KMS keys.
         • Use the KMS keys to perform the following cryptographic operations:
           • Encrypt
           • Decrypt
           • GenerateDataKey
           • GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
           • ReEncrypt
           The operations that generate asymmetric data key pairs, GenerateDataKeyPair and
           GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext, are not supported in custom key stores.

         • External key stores support only symmetric encryption KMS keys. You cannot create HMAC 
           KMS keys or asymmetric KMS keys in an external key store.
         • GenerateDataKeyPair and GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext are not supported on KMS 
           keys in an external key store.
         • You cannot use an AWS::KMS::Key AWS CloudFormation template to create an external key 
           store or a KMS key in an external key store.
         • Multi-Region keys are not supported in an external key store.
         • KMS keys with imported key material are not supported in an external key store.
         • Automatic key rotation is not supported for KMS keys in an external key store.
      Using KMS keys in an external key store
         When you use your KMS key in a request, identify the KMS key by its key ID, key ARN, alias, or 
         alias ARN. You do not need to specify the external key store. The response includes the same 
         ﬁelds that are returned for any symmetric encryption KMS key. However, when you use a KMS 
         key in an external key store, encryption and decryption operations are performed by your 
         external key manager using the external key that is associated with the KMS key.
         To ensure that ciphertext encrypted by a KMS key in an external key store is at least as secure as 
         any ciphertext encrypted by a standard KMS key, AWS KMS uses double encryption. Data is ﬁrst 
         encrypted in AWS KMS using AWS KMS key material. Then it is encrypted by your external key 
         manager using the external key for the KMS key. To decrypt double-encrypted ciphertext, the 
         ciphertext is ﬁrst decrypted by your external key manager using the external key for the KMS 
         key. Then it is decrypted in AWS KMS using the AWS KMS key material for the KMS key.
         To make this possible, the following conditions are required.
         •
           The key state of the KMS key must be Enabled. To ﬁnd the key state, see the Status ﬁeld 
           for customer managed keys the AWS KMS console or the KeyState ﬁeld in the DescribeKey
           response.
         • The external key store that hosts the KMS key must be connected to its external key store 
           proxy, that is, the connection state of the external key store must be CONNECTED.
           You can view the connection state on the External key stores page in the AWS KMS console 
           or in the DescribeCustomKeyStores response. The connection state of the external key store 
           is also displayed on the detail page for the KMS key in the AWS KMS console. On the detail

           Custom key store section.
           If the connection state is DISCONNECTED, you must ﬁrst connect it. If the connection state is
           FAILED, you must resolve the problem, disconnect the external key store, and then connect 
           it. For instructions, see Connect and disconnect external key stores.
         • The external key store proxy must be able to ﬁnd the external key.
         • The external key must be enabled and it must perform encryption and decryption.
           The status of the external key is independent of and not aﬀected by changes in the key state
           of the KMS key, including enabling and disabling the KMS key. Similarly, disabling or deleting 
           the external key doesn't change the key state of the KMS key, but cryptographic operations 
           using the associated KMS key will fail.
         If these conditions are not met, the cryptographic operation fails, and AWS KMS returns a
         KMSInvalidStateException exception. You might need to reconnect the external key store
         or use your external key manager tools to reconﬁgure or repair your external key. For additional 
         help, see the section called “Troubleshooting external key stores”.
         When using the KMS keys in an external key store, be aware that the KMS keys in each external 
         key store share a custom key store request quota for cryptographic operations. If you exceed 
         the quota, AWS KMS returns a ThrottlingException. For details about the custom key store

      one approved algorithm, or mode, to another. The initial default set of cryptographic algorithms

      has been selected from Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS-approved) algorithms for 
      their security properties and performance.
      Entropy and random number generation
      AWS KMS key generation is performed in the AWS KMS HSMs. The HSMs implement a hybrid 
      random number generator that uses the NIST SP800-90A Deterministic Random Bit Generator 
      (DRBG) CTR_DRBG using AES-256. It is seeded with a nondeterministic random bit generator with 
      384-bits of entropy and updated with additional entropy to provide prediction resistance on every 
      call for cryptographic material.
      Symmetric key operations (encryption only)
      All symmetric key encrypt commands used within HSMs use the Advanced Encryption Standards 
      (AES), in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) using 256-bit keys. The analogous calls to decrypt use the 
      inverse function.
      AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption scheme. In addition to encrypting plaintext to produce 
      ciphertext, it computes an authentication tag over the ciphertext and any additional data for which 
      authentication is required (additionally authenticated data, or AAD). The authentication tag helps 
      ensure that the data is from the purported source and that the ciphertext and AAD have not been 
      modiﬁed.
      Frequently, AWS omits the inclusion of the AAD in our descriptions, especially when referring to 
      the encryption of data keys. It is implied by surrounding text in these cases that the structure to 
      be encrypted is partitioned between the plaintext to be encrypted and the cleartext AAD to be 
      protected.
      AWS KMS provides an option for you to import key material into an AWS KMS key instead of 
      relying on AWS KMS to generate the key material. This imported key material can be encrypted 
      using RSAES-OAEP to protect the key during transport to the AWS KMS HSM. The RSA key pairs are 
      generated on AWS KMS HSMs. The imported key material is decrypted on an AWS KMS HSM and 
      re-encrypted under AES-GCM before being stored by the service.
      Asymmetric key operations (encryption, digital signing and signature 
      veriﬁcation)
      AWS KMS supports the use of asymmetric key operations for both encryption, digital signature, 
      and key agreement operations. Asymmetric key operations rely on a mathematically related public 
      Entropy and random number generation                                              60
      AWS Key Management Service                                                Developer Guide
      key and private key pair that you can use for encryption and decryption, signing and signature 
      veriﬁcation, or deriving shared secrets. The private key never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. You 
      can use the public key within AWS KMS by calling the AWS KMS API operations, or download the 
      public key and use it outside of AWS KMS.
      AWS KMS supports the following asymmetric ciphers.
      • RSA-OAEP (for encryption) & RSA-PSS and RSA-PKCS-#1-v1_5 (for signing and veriﬁcation) – 
        Supports RSA key lengths (in bits): 2048, 3072, and 4096 for diﬀerent security requirements.
      • Elliptic Curve (ECC) – Used for signing and veriﬁcation or deriving shared secrets, but not both. 
        Supports ECC curves: NIST P256, P384, P521, SECP 256k1.
      • ML-DSA – Used for signing and veriﬁcation. Supported ML-DSA key specs are: ML_DSA_44, 
        ML_DSA_65, and ML_DSA_87.
      • SM2 (China Regions only) – Used for encryption and decryption, signing and veriﬁcation, or 
        deriving shared secrets, but you must choose one key usage. Supports SM2PKE for encryption 
        and SM2DSA for signing.
      Key derivation functions
      A key derivation function is used to derive additional keys from an initial secret or key. AWS KMS 
      uses an key derivation function (KDF) to derive per-call keys for every encryption under an AWS 
      KMS key. All KDF operations use the KDF in counter mode using HMAC [FIPS197] with SHA256
      [FIPS180]. The 256-bit derived key is used with AES-GCM to encrypt or decrypt customer data and 
      keys.
      AWS KMS internal use of digital signatures
      Digital signatures are also used to authenticate commands and communications between AWS KMS 
      entities. All service entities have an elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) key pair. They 
      perform ECDSA as deﬁned in Use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Algorithms in Cryptographic 
      Message Syntax (CMS) and X9.62-2005: Public Key Cryptography for the Financial Services Industry: 
      The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). The entities use the secure hash algorithm 
      deﬁned in Federal Information Processing Standards Publications, FIPS PUB 180-4, known as 
      SHA384. The keys are generated on the curve secp384r1 (NIST-P384).

      Envelope encryption
      When you encrypt your data, your data is protected, but you have to protect your encryption key. 
      One strategy is to encrypt it. Envelope encryption is the practice of encrypting plaintext data with a 
      data key, and then encrypting the data key under another key.
      You can even encrypt the data encryption key under another encryption key, and encrypt that 
      encryption key under another encryption key. But, eventually, one key must remain in plaintext so 
      you can decrypt the keys and your data. This top-level plaintext key encryption key is known as the
      root key.
      AWS KMS helps you to protect your encryption keys by storing and managing them securely. Root 
      key stored in AWS KMS, known as AWS KMS keys, never leave the AWS KMS FIPS 140-3 Security 
      Level 3 validated hardware security modules unencrypted. To use a KMS key, you must call AWS 
      KMS.
      A basic construction used within many cryptographic systems is envelope encryption. Envelope 
      encryption uses two or more cryptographic keys to secure a message. Typically, one key is 
      derived from a longer-term static key k, and another key is a per-message key, msgKey, which is 
      generated to encrypt the message. The envelope is formed by encrypting the message: ciphertext 
      = Encrypt(msgKey, message) . Then the message key is encrypted with the long-term static key:
      encKey = Encrypt(k, msgKey) . Finally, the two values  (encKey, ciphertext)  are packaged into a single 
      structure, or envelope encrypted message.
      The recipient, with access to k, can open the enveloped message by ﬁrst decrypting the encrypted 
      key and then decrypting the message.
      AWS KMS provides the ability to manage these longer-term static keys and automate the process 
      of envelope encryption of your data.
      Envelope encryption                                                           62
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     In addition to the encryption capabilities provided within the AWS KMS service, the AWS 
     Encryption SDK provides client-side envelope encryption libraries. You can use these libraries to 
     protect your data and the encryption keys that are used to encrypt that data.
     Envelope encryption oﬀers several beneﬁts:
     • Protecting data keys
       When you encrypt a data key, you don't have to worry about storing the encrypted data key, 
       because the data key is inherently protected by encryption. You can safely store the encrypted 
       data key alongside the encrypted data.
     • Encrypting the same data under multiple keys
       Encryption operations can be time consuming, particularly when the data being encrypted are 
       large objects. Instead of re-encrypting raw data multiple times with diﬀerent keys, you can re-
       encrypt only the data keys that protect the raw data.
     • Combining the strengths of multiple algorithms
       In general, symmetric key algorithms are faster and produce smaller ciphertexts than public 
       key algorithms. But public key algorithms provide inherent separation of roles and easier key 
       management. Envelope encryption lets you combine the strengths of each strategy.
     Cryptographic operations
     In AWS KMS, cryptographic operations are API operations that use KMS keys to protect data. 
     Because KMS keys remain within AWS KMS, you must call AWS KMS to use a KMS key in a 
     cryptographic operation.

      To perform cryptographic operations with KMS keys, use the AWS SDKs, AWS Command Line 
      Interface (AWS CLI), or the AWS Tools for PowerShell. You cannot perform cryptographic 
      operations in the AWS KMS console. For examples of calling the cryptographic operations in several 
      programming languages, see Code examples for AWS KMS using AWS SDKs.

     KMS key access and permissions
     To use AWS KMS, you must have credentials that AWS can use to authenticate your requests. The 
     credentials must include permissions to access AWS resources: AWS KMS keys and aliases. No AWS 
     principal has any permissions to a KMS key unless that permission is provided explicitly and never 
     denied. There are no implicit or automatic permission to use or manage a KMS key.
     To control access to your KMS keys, you can use the following policy mechanisms.
     • Key policy – Every KMS key has a key policy. It is the primary mechanism for controlling access 
       to a KMS key. You can use the key policy alone to control access, which means the full scope of 
       access to the KMS key is deﬁned in a single document (the key policy). For more information 
       about using key policies, see Key policies.
     • IAM policies – You can use IAM policies in combination with the key policy and grants to control 
       access to a KMS key. Controlling access this way enables you to manage all of the permissions for 
       your IAM identities in IAM. To use an IAM policy to allow access to a KMS key, the key policy must 
       explicitly allow it. For more information about using IAM policies, see IAM policies.
     • Grants – You can use grants in combination with the key policy and IAM policies to allow access 
       to a KMS key. Controlling access this way enables you to allow access to the KMS key in the key 
       policy, and to allow identities to delegate their access to others. For more information about 
       using grants, see Grants in AWS KMS.
     KMS key policies
     The primary way to manage access to your AWS KMS resources is with policies. Policies are 
     documents that describe which principals can access which resources. Policies attached to an IAM 
     identity are called identity-based policies (or IAM policies), and policies attached to other kinds 
     of resources are called resource policies. AWS KMS resource policies for KMS keys are called key 
     policies.
     All KMS keys have a key policy. If you don't provide one, AWS KMS creates one for you. The default 
     key policy that AWS KMS uses diﬀers depending on whether you create the key in the AWS KMS 
     console or you use the AWS KMS API. We recommend that you edit the default key policy to align 
     with your organization’s requirements for least-privilege permissions.
     You can use the key policy alone to control access if the key and the IAM principal are in the same 
     AWS account, which means the full scope of access to the KMS key is deﬁned in a single document 
     KMS key policies                                                   66
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     (the key policy). However, when a caller in one account must access a key in a diﬀerent account, you 
     cannot use key policy alone to grant access. In the cross-account scenario, an IAM policy must be 
     attached to the caller's user or role that explicitly allows the caller to make the API call.
     You can also use IAM policies in combination with key policies and grants to control access to a 
     KMS key. To use an IAM policy to control access to a KMS key, the key policy must give the account 
     permission to use IAM policies. You can either specify a key policy statement that enables IAM 
     policies, or you can explicitly specify allowed principals in the key policy.
     When writing policies, ensure that you have strong controls restricting who can perform the 
     following actions:
     • Update, create, and delete IAM and KMS key policies
     • Attach and detach IAM policies from users, roles, and groups
     • Attach and detach KMS key polices from your KMS keys
     KMS key grants
     In addition to IAM and key policies, AWS KMS supports grants. Grants provide a ﬂexible and 
     powerful way to delegate permissions. You can use grants to issue time-bound KMS key access to 
     IAM principals in your AWS account, or in other AWS accounts. We recommend issuing time-bound 
     access if you don't know the names of the principals at the time that the policies are created, 
     or if the principals that require access frequently change. The grantee principal can be in the 
     same account as the KMS key or a diﬀerent account. If the principal and KMS key are in diﬀerent 
     accounts, then you must specify an IAM policy in addition to the grant. Grants require additional 
     management because you must call an API to create the grant and to retire or revoke the grant 
     when it is no longer needed.
     Key policies in AWS KMS
     A key policy is a resource policy for an AWS KMS key. Key policies are the primary way to control 
     access to KMS keys. Every KMS key must have exactly one key policy. The statements in the key 
     policy determine who has permission to use the KMS key and how they can use it. You can also use
     IAM policies and grants to control access to the KMS key, but every KMS key must have a key policy.
     No AWS principal, including the account root user or key creator, has any permissions to a KMS key 
     unless they are explicitly allowed, and never denied, in a key policy, IAM policy, or grant.
     KMS key grants                                                     67

      Unless the key policy explicitly allows it, you cannot use IAM policies to allow access to a KMS key. 
      Without permission from the key policy, IAM policies that allow permissions have no eﬀect. (You 
      can use an IAM policy to deny a permission to a KMS key without permission from a key policy.) The 
      default key policy enables IAM policies. To enable IAM policies in your key policy, add the policy 
      statement described in Allows access to the AWS account and enables IAM policies.
      Unlike IAM policies, which are global, key policies are Regional. A key policy controls access only to 
      a KMS key in the same Region. It has no eﬀect on KMS keys in other Regions.

      Creating a key policy
      You can create and manage key policies in the AWS KMS console or by using AWS KMS API 
      operations, such as CreateKey, ReplicateKey, and PutKeyPolicy.
      When you create a KMS key in the AWS KMS console, the console walks you through the steps of 
      creating a key policy based on the default key policy for the console. When you use the CreateKey
      or ReplicateKey APIs, if you don't specify a key policy, these APIs apply the default key policy for 
      keys created programmatically. When you use the PutKeyPolicy API, you are required to specify 
      a key policy.
      Each policy document can have one or more policy statements. The following example shows a 
      valid key policy document with one policy statement.

      • Up to 32 kilobytes (32,768 bytes)
      •
        The Sid element in a key policy statement can include spaces. (Spaces are prohibited in the Sid

      Statement
         Encloses the policy statements. A key policy document must have at least one statement.
         Each key policy statement consists of up to six elements. The Effect, Principal, Action, 
         and Resource elements are required.
         Sid
            (Optional) The statement identiﬁer (Sid) an arbitrary string you can use to describe the 
            statement. The Sid in a key policy can include spaces. (You can't include spaces in an IAM 
            policy Sid element.)
         Eﬀect
            (Required) Determines whether to allow or deny the permissions in the policy statement. 
            Valid values are Allow or Deny. If you don't explicitly allow access to a KMS key, access 
            is implicitly denied. You can also explicitly deny access to a KMS key. You might do this to 
            make sure that a user cannot access it, even when a diﬀerent policy allows access.
         Principal
            (Required) The principal is the identity that gets the permissions speciﬁed in the policy 
            statement. You can specify AWS accounts, IAM users, IAM roles, and some AWS services as 
            principals in a key policy. IAM user groups are not a valid principal in any policy type.
            An asterisk value, such as "AWS": "*" represents all AWS identities in all accounts.
                Important
                Do not set the Principal to an asterisk (*) in any key policy statement that allows 
                permissions unless you use conditions to limit the key policy. An asterisk gives every 
                identity in every AWS account permission to use the KMS key, unless another policy 
                statement explicitly denies it. Users in other AWS accounts can use your KMS key 
                whenever they have corresponding permissions in their own account.
                Note
                IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. 
                Whenever possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, 
                see Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
      Creating a key policy                                                             70

            When the principal in a key policy statement is an AWS account principal expressed 
            as arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root", the policy statement doesn't give 
            permission to any IAM principal. Instead, it gives the AWS account permission to use 
            IAM policies to delegate the permissions speciﬁed in the key policy. (A principal in
            arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root" format does not represent the AWS account root 
            user, despite the use of "root" in the account identiﬁer. However, the account principal 
            represents the account and its administrators, including the account root user.)
            When the principal is another AWS account or its principals, the permissions are eﬀective 
            only when the account is enabled in the Region with the KMS key and key policy. For 
            information about Regions that are not enabled by default ("opt-in Regions"), see Managing 
            AWS Regions in the AWS General Reference.
            To allow a diﬀerent AWS account or its principals to use a KMS key, you must provide 
            permission in a key policy and in an IAM policy in the other account. For details, see Allowing 
            users in other accounts to use a KMS key.
         Action
            (Required) Specify the API operations to allow or deny. For example, the kms:Encrypt
            action corresponds to the AWS KMS Encrypt operation. You can list more than one action in 
            a policy statement. For more information, see Permissions reference.
                 Note
                 If the required Action element is missing from a key policy statement, the policy 
                 statement has no eﬀect. A key policy statement without an Action element doesn't 
                 apply to any KMS key.
                 When a key policy statement is missing its Action element, the AWS KMS console 
                 correctly reports an error, but the CreateKey and PutKeyPolicy APIs succeed, even 
                 though the policy statement is ineﬀective.
         Resource
            (Required) In a key policy, the value of the Resource element is "*", which means "this KMS 
            key." The asterisk ("*") identiﬁes the KMS key to which the key policy is attached.
      Creating a key policy                                                                   71

                 Note
                 If the required Resource element is missing from a key policy statement, the policy 
                 statement has no eﬀect. A key policy statement without a Resource element 
                 doesn't apply to any KMS key.
                 When a key policy statement is missing its Resource element, the AWS KMS console 
                 correctly reports an error, but the CreateKey and PutKeyPolicy APIs succeed, even 
                 though the policy statement is ineﬀective.
         Condition
            (Optional) Conditions specify requirements that must be met for a key policy to take eﬀect. 
            With conditions, AWS can evaluate the context of an API request to determine whether or 
            not the policy statement applies.
            To specify conditions, you use predeﬁned condition keys. AWS KMS supports AWS global 
            condition keys and AWS KMS condition keys. To support attribute-based access control 
            (ABAC), AWS KMS provides condition keys that control access to a KMS key based on tags 
            and aliases. For details, see ABAC for AWS KMS.
            The format for a condition is:
              "Condition": {"condition operator": {"condition key": "condition value"}}
            such as:
              "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"kms:CallerAccount": "111122223333"}}

      Guide.
      Example key policy
      The following example shows a complete key policy for a symmetric encryption KMS key. You 
      can use it for reference as you read about the key policy concepts in this chapter. This key policy 
      combines the example policy statements from the preceding default key policy section into a 
      single key policy that accomplishes the following:

      Default key policy
      When you create a KMS key, you can specify the key policy for the new KMS key. If you don't 
      provide one, AWS KMS creates one for you. The default key policy that AWS KMS uses diﬀers 
      depending on whether you create the key in the AWS KMS console or you use the AWS KMS API.
      Default key policy when you create a KMS key programmatically
         When you create a KMS key programmatically with the AWS KMS API (including by using the
         AWS SDKs, AWS Command Line Interface or AWS Tools for PowerShell), and you don't specify 
         a key policy, AWS KMS applies a very simple default key policy. This default key policy has one 
         policy statement that gives the AWS account that owns the KMS key permission to use IAM 
         policies to allow access to all AWS KMS operations on the KMS key. For more information about 
         this policy statement, see Allows access to the AWS account and enables IAM policies.
      Default key policy when you create a KMS key with the AWS Management Console
         When you create a KMS key with the AWS Management Console, the key policy begins with the 
         policy statement that allows access to the AWS account and enables IAM policies. The console 
         then adds a key administrators statement, a key users statement, and (for most key types) a 
         statement that allows principals to use the KMS key with other AWS services. You can use the 
         features of the AWS KMS console to specify the IAM users, IAM roles, and AWS accounts who 
         are key administrators and those who are key users (or both).
      Permissions
      • Allows access to the AWS account and enables IAM policies
      • Allows key administrators to administer the KMS key
      • Allows key users to use the KMS key
        • Allows key users to use a KMS key for cryptographic operations
        • Allows key users to use the KMS key with AWS services
      Allows access to the AWS account and enables IAM policies
      The following default key policy statement is critical.
      • It gives the AWS account that owns the KMS key full access to the KMS key.
      Default key policy                                                                      75
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
        Unlike other AWS resource policies, an AWS KMS key policy does not automatically give 
        permission to the account or any of its identities. To give permission to account administrators, 
        the key policy must include an explicit statement that provides this permission, like this one.
      • It allows the account to use IAM policies to allow access to the KMS key, in addition to the key 
        policy.
        Without this permission, IAM policies that allow access to the key are ineﬀective, although IAM 
        policies that deny access to the key are still eﬀective.
      • It reduces the risk of the key becoming unmanageable by giving access control permission to the 
        account administrators, including the account root user, which cannot be deleted.
      The following key policy statement is the entire default key policy for KMS keys created 
      programmatically. It's the ﬁrst policy statement in the default key policy for KMS keys created in 
      the AWS KMS console.
        { 
          "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions", 
          "Effect": "Allow", 
          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root" 
           }, 
          "Action": "kms:*", 
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      Allows IAM policies to allow access to the KMS key.
         The key policy statement shown above gives the AWS account that owns the key permission to 
         use IAM policies, as well as key policies, to allow all actions (kms:*) on the KMS key.
         The principal in this key policy statement is the account principal, which is represented by an 
         ARN in this format: arn:aws:iam::account-id:root. The account principal represents the 
         AWS account and its administrators.
         When the principal in a key policy statement is the account principal, the policy statement 
         doesn't give any IAM principal permission to use the KMS key. Instead, it allows the account to 
         use IAM policies to delegate the permissions speciﬁed in the policy statement. This default key 
      Default key policy                                                                       76
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
         policy statement allows the account to use IAM policies to delegate permission for all actions 
         (kms:*) on the KMS key.
       Reduces the risk of the KMS key becoming unmanageable.
         Unlike other AWS resource policies, an AWS KMS key policy does not automatically give 
         permission to the account or any of its principals. To give permission to any principal, including 
         the account principal, you must use a key policy statement that provides the permission 
         explicitly. You are not required to give the account principal, or any principal, access to the KMS 
         key. However, giving access to the account principal helps you prevent the key from becoming 
         unmanageable.
         For example, suppose you create a key policy that gives only one user access to the KMS key. If 
         you then delete that user, the key becomes unmanageable and you must contact AWS Support
         to regain access to the KMS key.
         The key policy statement shown above gives permission to control the key to the account 
         principal, which represents the AWS account and its administrators, including the account root 
         user. The account root user is the only principal that cannot be deleted unless you delete the 
         AWS account. IAM best practices discourage acting on behalf of the account root user, except in 
         an emergency. However, you might need to act as the account root user if you delete all other 
         users and roles with access to the KMS key.
      Allows key administrators to administer the KMS key
      The default key policy created by the console allows you to choose IAM users and roles in the 
      account and make them key administrators. This statement is called the key administrators 
      statement. Key administrators have permissions to manage the KMS key, but do not have 
      permissions to use the KMS key in cryptographic operations. You can add IAM users and roles to 
      the list of key administrators when you create the KMS key in the default view or the policy view.
           Warning
           Because key administrators have permission to change the key policy and create grants, 
           they can give themselves and others AWS KMS permissions not speciﬁed in this policy.
           Principals who have permission to manage tags and aliases can also control access to a KMS 
           key. For details, see ABAC for AWS KMS.
      Default key policy                                                                       77

          Note
          IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. Whenever 
          possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, see Security best 
          practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
      The following example shows the key administrators statement in the default view of the AWS 
      KMS console.
      The following is an example key administrators statement in the policy view of the AWS KMS 
      console. This key administrators statement is for a single-Region symmetric encryption KMS key.

           Note
           The AWS KMS console adds key administrators to the key policy under the statement

      The default key administrators statement for the most common KMS key, a single-Region 
      symmetric encryption KMS key, allows the following permissions. For detailed information about 
      each permission, see the AWS KMS permissions.
      When you use the AWS KMS console to create a KMS key, the console adds the users and roles you 
      specify to the Principal element in the key administrators statement.
      Many of these permissions contain the wildcard character (*), which allows all permissions 
      that begin with the speciﬁed verb. As a result, when AWS KMS adds new API operations, key 
      administrators are automatically allowed to use them. You don't have to update your key policies

      to include the new operations. If you prefer to limit your key administrators to a ﬁxed set of API 
      operations, you can change your key policy.
      kms:Create*
         Allows kms:CreateAlias and kms:CreateGrant. (The kms:CreateKey permission is valid 
         only in an IAM policy.)
      kms:Describe*
         Allows kms:DescribeKey. The kms:DescribeKey permission is required to view the key 
         details page for a KMS key in the AWS Management Console.
      kms:Enable*
         Allows kms:EnableKey. For symmetric encryption KMS keys, it also allows
         kms:EnableKeyRotation.
      kms:List*
         Allows kms:ListGrants, kms:ListKeyPolicies, and kms:ListResourceTags. (The
         kms:ListAliases and kms:ListKeys permissions, which are required to view KMS keys in 
         the AWS Management Console, are valid only in IAM policies.)
      kms:Put*
         Allows kms:PutKeyPolicy. This permission allows key administrators to change the key policy 
         for this KMS key.
      kms:Update*
         Allows kms:UpdateAlias and kms:UpdateKeyDescription. For multi-Region keys, it 
         allows kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion on this KMS key.
      kms:Revoke*
         Allows kms:RevokeGrant, which allows key administrators to delete a grant even if they are 
         not a retiring principal in the grant.
      kms:Disable*
         Allows kms:DisableKey. For symmetric encryption KMS keys, it also allows
         kms:DisableKeyRotation.

      kms:Get*
         Allows kms:GetKeyPolicy and kms:GetKeyRotationStatus. For KMS keys with imported 
         key material, it allows kms:GetParametersForImport. For asymmetric KMS keys, it allows
         kms:GetPublicKey. The kms:GetKeyPolicy permission is required to view the key policy of 
         a KMS key in the AWS Management Console.
      kms:Delete*
         Allows kms:DeleteAlias. For keys with imported key material, it allows
         kms:DeleteImportedKeyMaterial. The kms:Delete* permission does not allow key 
         administrators to delete the KMS key (ScheduleKeyDeletion).
      kms:TagResource
         Allows kms:TagResource, which allows key administrators to add tags to the KMS key. 
         Because tags can also be used to control access to the KMS key, this permission can allow 
         administrators to allow or deny access to the KMS key. For details, see ABAC for AWS KMS.
      kms:UntagResource
         Allows kms:UntagResource, which allows key administrators to delete tags from the KMS key. 
         Because tags can be used to control access to the key, this permission can allow administrators 
         to allow or deny access to the KMS key. For details, see ABAC for AWS KMS.
      kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion
         Allows kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion, which allows key administrators to delete this KMS key. 
         To delete this permission, clear the Allow key administrators to delete this key option.
      kms:CancelKeyDeletion
         Allows kms:CancelKeyDeletion, which allows key administrators to cancel deletion of this 
         KMS key. To delete this permission, clear the Allow key administrators to delete this key
         option.
      kms:RotateKeyOnDemand
         Allows kms:RotateKeyOnDemand, which allows key administrators to perform on-demand 
         rotation of the key material in this KMS key.

      AWS KMS adds the following permissions to the default key administrators statement when you 
      create special-purpose keys.
      kms:ImportKeyMaterial
         The kms:ImportKeyMaterial permission allows key administrators to import key material 
         into the KMS key. This permission is included in the key policy only when you create a KMS key 
         with no key material.
      kms:ReplicateKey
         The kms:ReplicateKey permission allows key administrators to create a replica of a multi-
         Region primary key in a diﬀerent AWS Region. This permission is included in the key policy only 
         when you create a multi-Region primary or replica key.
      kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion
         The kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion permission allows key administrators to change a multi-
         Region replica key to a multi-Region primary key. This permission is included in the key policy 
         only when you create a multi-Region primary or replica key.
      Allows key users to use the KMS key
      The default key policy that the console creates for KMS keys allows you to choose IAM users and 
      IAM roles in the account, and external AWS accounts, and make them key users.
      The console adds two policy statements to the key policy for key users.
      • Use the KMS key directly — The ﬁrst key policy statement gives key users permission to use the 
        KMS key directly for all supported cryptographic operations for that type of KMS key.
      • Use the KMS key with AWS services — The second policy statement gives key users permission 
        to allow AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS to use the KMS key on their behalf to 
        protect resources, such as Amazon S3 buckets and Amazon DynamoDB tables.
      You can add IAM users, IAM roles, and other AWS accounts to the list of key users when you create 
      the KMS key. You can also edit the list with the console's default view for key policies, as shown 
      in the following image. The default view for key policies is on the key details page. For more 
      information about allowing users in other AWS accounts to use the KMS key, see Allowing users in 
      other accounts to use a KMS key.

          Note
          IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. Whenever 
          possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, see Security best 
          practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
      The default key users statements for a single-Region symmetric allows the following permissions. 
      For detailed information about each permission, see the AWS KMS permissions.
      When you use the AWS KMS console to create a KMS key, the console adds the users and roles you 
      specify to the Principal element in each key users statement.
          Note
          The AWS KMS console adds key users to the key policy under the statement identiﬁers
          "Allow use of the key" and "Allow attachment of persistent resources". 
      Default key policy                                                             83

           Modifying these statement identiﬁers might impact how the console displays updates that 
           you make to the statement.

      Allows key users to use a KMS key for cryptographic operations
      Key users have permission to use the KMS key directly in all cryptographic operations supported on 
      the KMS key. They can also use the DescribeKey operation to get detailed information about the 
      KMS key in the AWS KMS console or by using the AWS KMS API operations.
      Default key policy                                                                       84

      By default, the AWS KMS console adds key users statements like those in the following examples 
      to the default key policy. Because they support diﬀerent API operations, the actions in the policy 
      statements for symmetric encryption KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric KMS keys for public 
      key encryption, and asymmetric KMS keys for signing and veriﬁcation are slightly diﬀerent.
      Symmetric encryption KMS keys
         The console adds the following statement to the key policy for symmetric encryption KMS keys.
           { 
             "Sid": "Allow use of the key", 
             "Effect": "Allow",   
             "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/ExampleKeyUserRole"},

               "kms:Decrypt", 
               "kms:DescribeKey", 
               "kms:Encrypt", 
               "kms:GenerateDataKey*", 
               "kms:ReEncrypt*" 
             ], 
             "Resource": "*"
           }
      HMAC KMS keys
         The console adds the following statement to the key policy for HMAC KMS keys.
           { 
             "Sid": "Allow use of the key", 
             "Effect": "Allow",

             ], 
             "Resource": "*"
           }
      Asymmetric KMS keys for public key encryption
         The console adds the following statement to the key policy for asymmetric KMS keys with a key 
         usage of Encrypt and decrypt.
      Default key policy                                                                       85

               "kms:Encrypt", 
               "kms:Decrypt", 
               "kms:ReEncrypt*", 
               "kms:DescribeKey",

             ], 
             "Resource": "*"
           }
      Asymmetric KMS keys for signing and veriﬁcation
         The console adds the following statement to the key policy for asymmetric KMS keys with a key 
         usage of Sign and verify.
           { 
             "Sid": "Allow use of the key", 
             "Effect": "Allow", 
             "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/ExampleKeyUserRole"}, 
             "Action": [ 
               "kms:DescribeKey", 
               "kms:GetPublicKey", 
               "kms:Sign", 
               "kms:Verify" 
             ], 
             "Resource": "*"
           }
      Asymmetric KMS keys for deriving shared secrets
         The console adds the following statement to the key policy for asymmetric KMS keys with a key 
         usage of Key agreement.
           { 
             "Sid": "Allow use of the key", 
             "Effect": "Allow", 
      Default key policy                                                                       86

             "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/ExampleKeyUserRole"}, 
             "Action": [ 
               "kms:DescribeKey", 
               "kms:GetPublicKey", 
               "kms:DeriveSharedSecret" 
             ], 
             "Resource": "*"
           }
      The actions in these statements give the key users the following permissions.
      kms:Encrypt
         Allows key users to encrypt data with this KMS key.
      kms:Decrypt
         Allows key users to decrypt data with this KMS key.
      kms:DeriveSharedSecret
         Allows key users to derive shared secrets with this KMS key.
      kms:DescribeKey
         Allows key users to get detailed information about this KMS key including its identiﬁers, 
         creation date, and key state. It also allows the key users to display details about the KMS key in 
         the AWS KMS console.
      kms:GenerateDataKey*
         Allows key users to request a symmetric data key or an asymmetric data key pair for client-side 
         cryptographic operations. The console uses the * wildcard character to represent permission 
         for the following API operations: GenerateDataKey, GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext,
         GenerateDataKeyPair, and GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext. These permissions are valid 
         only on the symmetric KMS keys that encrypt the data keys.
      kms:GenerateMac
         Allows key users to use an HMAC KMS key to generate an HMAC tag.
      Default key policy                                                                       87

      kms:GetPublicKey
         Allows key users to download the public key of the asymmetric KMS key. Parties with whom you 
         share this public key can encrypt data outside of AWS KMS. However, those ciphertexts can be 
         decrypted only by calling the Decrypt operation in AWS KMS.
      kms:ReEncrypt*
         Allows key users to re-encrypt data that was originally encrypted with this KMS key, or to 
         use this KMS key to re-encrypt previously encrypted data. The ReEncrypt operation requires 
         access to both source and destination KMS keys. To accomplish this, you can allow the
         kms:ReEncryptFrom permission on the source KMS key and kms:ReEncryptTo permission 
         on the destination KMS key. However, for simplicity, the console allows kms:ReEncrypt* (with 
         the * wildcard character) on both KMS keys.
      kms:Sign
         Allows key users to sign messages with this KMS key.
      kms:Verify
         Allows key users to verify signatures with this KMS key.
      kms:VerifyMac
         Allows key users to use an HMAC KMS key to verify an HMAC tag.
      Allows key users to use the KMS key with AWS services
      The default key policy in the console also gives key users the grant permissions they need to 
      protect their data in AWS services that use grants. AWS services often use grants to get speciﬁc and 
      limited permission to use a KMS key.
      This key policy statement allows the key user to create, view, and revoke grants on the KMS key, 
      but only when the grant operation request comes from an AWS service integrated with AWS 
      KMS. The kms:GrantIsForAWSResource policy condition doesn't allow the user to call these grant 
      operations directly. When the key user allows it, an AWS service can create a grant on the user's 
      behalf that allows the service to use the KMS key to protect the user's data.
      Key users require these grant permissions to use their KMS key with integrated services, but these 
      permissions are not suﬃcient. Key users also need permission to use the integrated services. For 
      Default key policy                                                                      88

      details about giving users access to an AWS service that integrates with AWS KMS, consult the 
      documentation for the integrated service.
        { 
          "Sid": "Allow attachment of persistent resources", 
          "Effect": "Allow", 
          "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/ExampleKeyUserRole"}, 
          "Action": [ 
            "kms:CreateGrant", 
            "kms:ListGrants", 
            "kms:RevokeGrant" 
          ], 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Condition": {"Bool": {"kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": true}}
        }
      For example, key users can use these permissions on the KMS key in the following ways.
      • Use this KMS key with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and Amazon Elastic Compute 
        Cloud (Amazon EC2) to attach an encrypted EBS volume to an EC2 instance. The key user 
        implicitly gives Amazon EC2 permission to use the KMS key to attach the encrypted volume to 
        the instance. For more information, see How Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) uses AWS 
        KMS.
      • Use this KMS key with Amazon Redshift to launch an encrypted cluster. The key user implicitly 
        gives Amazon Redshift permission to use the KMS key to launch the encrypted cluster and create 
        encrypted snapshots. For more information, see How Amazon Redshift uses AWS KMS.
      • Use this KMS key with other AWS services integrated with AWS KMS that use grants to create, 
        manage, or use encrypted resources with those services.
      The default key policy allows key users to delegate their grant permission to all integrated services 
      that use grants. However, you can create a custom key policy that restricts the permission to 
      speciﬁed AWS services. For more information, see the kms:ViaService condition key.
      View a key policies
      You can view the key policy for an AWS KMS customer managed key or an AWS managed key in 
      your account by using the AWS KMS console or the GetKeyPolicy operation in the AWS KMS API. 
      You cannot use these techniques to view the key policy of a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account.

      To learn more about AWS KMS key policies, see Key policies in AWS KMS. To learn how to 
      determine which users and roles have access to a KMS key, see the section called “Determining 
      access”.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      Authorized users can view the key policy for an AWS managed key or a customer managed key on 
      the Key policy tab of the AWS Management Console.
      To view the key policy for a KMS key in the AWS Management Console, you must have
      kms:ListAliases, kms:DescribeKey, and kms:GetKeyPolicy permissions.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.
          To view the keys in your account that AWS creates and manages for you, in the navigation 
          pane, choose AWS managed keys. To view the keys in your account that you create and 
          manage, in the navigation pane choose Customer managed keys.
      4.  In the list of KMS keys, choose the alias or key ID of the KMS key that you want to examine.
      5.  Choose the Key policy tab.
          On the Key policy tab, you might see the key policy document. This is policy view. In the key 
          policy statements, you can see the principals who have been given access to the KMS key by 
          the key policy, and you can see the actions they can perform.
          The following example shows the policy view for the default key policy.
      View a key policies                                                                      90

        Or, if you created the KMS key in the AWS Management Console, you will see the default view
        with sections for Key administrators, Key deletion, and Key Users. To see the key policy 
        document, choose Switch to policy view.
        The following example shows the default view for the default key policy.

      Using the AWS KMS API
      To get the key policy for a KMS key in your AWS account, use the GetKeyPolicy operation in the 
      AWS KMS API. You cannot use this operation to view a key policy in a diﬀerent account.
      The following example uses the get-key-policy command in the AWS Command Line Interface 
      (AWS CLI), but you can use any AWS SDK to make this request.
      View a key policies                                                                 92

      Note that the PolicyName parameter is required even though default is its only valid value. 
      Also, this command requests the output in text, rather than JSON, to make it easier to view.
      Before running this command, replace the example key ID with a valid one from your account.
        $ aws kms get-key-policy --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab --policy-name 
         default --output text
      The response should be similar to the following one, which returns the default key policy.
        { 
          "Version" : "2012-10-17", 
          "Id" : "key-consolepolicy-3", 
          "Statement" : [ { 
            "Sid" : "Enable IAM User Permissions",

              "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root" 
            }, 
            "Action" : "kms:*", 
            "Resource" : "*" 
          } ]
        }
      Change a key policy
      You can change the key policy for a KMS key in your AWS account by using the AWS Management 
      Console or the PutKeyPolicy operation. You cannot use these techniques to change the key policy 
      of a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account.
      When changing a key policy, keep in mind the following rules:
      • You can view the key policy for an AWS managed key or a customer managed key, but you can 
        only change the key policy for a customer managed key. The policies of AWS managed keys are 
        created and managed by the AWS service that created the KMS key in your account. You cannot 
        view or change the key policy for an AWS owned key.
      • You can add or remove IAM users, IAM roles, and AWS accounts in the key policy, and change the 
        actions that are allowed or denied for those principals. For more information about the ways to 
        specify principals and permissions in a key policy, see Key policies.

      • You cannot add IAM groups to a key policy, but you can add multiple IAM users and IAM roles. 
        For more information, see Allowing multiple IAM principals to access a KMS key.
      • If you add external AWS accounts to a key policy, you must also use IAM policies in the external 
        accounts to give permissions to IAM users, groups, or roles in those accounts. For more 
        information, see Allowing users in other accounts to use a KMS key.
      • The resulting key policy document cannot exceed 32 KB (32,768 bytes).
      How to change a key policy
      You can change a key policy in three diﬀerent ways as explained in the following sections.
      Topics
      • Using the AWS Management Console default view
      • Using the AWS Management Console policy view
      • Using the AWS KMS API
      Using the AWS Management Console default view
      You can use the console to change a key policy with a graphical interface called the default view.
      If the following steps don't match what you see in the console, it might mean that this key policy 
      was not created by the console. Or it might mean that the key policy has been modiﬁed in a way 
      that the console's default view does not support. In that case, follow the steps at Using the AWS 
      Management Console policy view or Using the AWS KMS API.
      1.  View the key policy for a customer managed key as described in Using the AWS KMS console. 
          (You cannot change the key policies of AWS managed keys.)
      2.  Decide what to change.
          • To add or remove key administrators, and to allow or prevent key administrators from
            deleting the KMS key, use the controls in the Key administrators section of the page. Key 
            administrators manage the KMS key, including enabling and disabling it, setting key policy, 
            and enabling key rotation.
          • To add or remove key users, and to allow or disallow external AWS accounts to use the KMS 
            key, use the controls in the Key users section of the page. Key users can use the KMS key 
            in cryptographic operations, such as encrypting, decrypting, re-encrypting, and generating 
            data keys.

      Using the AWS Management Console policy view
      You can use the console to change a key policy document with the console's policy view.
      1.  View the key policy for a customer managed key as described in Using the AWS KMS console. 
          (You cannot change the key policies of AWS managed keys.)
      2.  In the Key Policy section, choose Switch to policy view.
      3.  Choose Edit.
      4.  Decide what to change.
          • To add a new statement, choose Add new statement. Then, you can select the actions, 
            principals, and conditions for your new key policy statement from the options listed in the 
            statement builder panel, or manually enter the policy statement elements.
          • To remove a statement from your key policy, select the statement and then choose Remove. 
            Review the selected policy statement and conﬁrm that you want to remove it. If you decide 
            that you do not want to proceed with removing the statement, choose Cancel.
          • To edit an existing key policy statement, select the statement. Then, you can use the 
            statement builder panel to choose speciﬁc elements that you want to modify, or manually 
            edit the statement.
      5.  Choose Save changes.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      You can use the PutKeyPolicy operation to change the key policy of a KMS key in your AWS 
      account. You cannot use this API on a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account.
      1.  Use the GetKeyPolicy operation to get the existing key policy document, and then save the 
          key policy document to a ﬁle. For sample code in multiple programming languages, see Use
          GetKeyPolicy with an AWS SDK or CLI.
      2.  Open the key policy document in your preferred text editor, edit the key policy document, and 
          then save the ﬁle.
      3.  Use the PutKeyPolicy operation to apply the updated key policy document to the KMS key. For 
          sample code in multiple programming languages, see Use PutKeyPolicy with an AWS SDK or 
          CLI.

      For an example of copying a key policy from one KMS key to another, see the GetKeyPolicy 
      example in the AWS CLI Command Reference.
      Permissions for AWS services in key policies
      Many AWS services use AWS KMS keys to protect the resources they manage. When a service uses
      AWS owned keys or AWS managed keys, the service establishes and maintains the key policies for 
      these KMS keys.
      However, when you use a customer managed key with an AWS service, you set and maintain the 
      key policy. That key policy must allow the service the minimum permissions that it requires to 
      protect the resource on your behalf. We recommend that you follow the principle of least privilege: 
      give the service only the permissions that it requires. You can do this eﬀectively by learning which 
      permissions the service needs and using AWS global condition keys and AWS KMS condition keys to 
      reﬁne the permissions.
      To ﬁnd the permissions that the service requires on a customer managed key, see the encryption 
      documentation for the service. For example, for the permissions that Amazon Elastic Block Store 
      (Amazon EBS) requires, see Permissions for IAM users in the Amazon EC2 User Guide and Amazon 
      EC2 User Guide. For the permissions that Secrets Manager requires, see Authorizing use of the KMS 
      key in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.
      Using IAM policies with AWS KMS
      You can use IAM policies, along with key policies, grants, and VPC endpoint policies, to control 
      access to your AWS KMS keys in AWS KMS.
           Note
           To use an IAM policy to control access to a KMS key, the key policy for the KMS key must 
           give the account permission to use IAM policies. Speciﬁcally, the key policy must include the
           policy statement that enables IAM policies.
           This section explains how to use IAM policies to control access to AWS KMS operations. For 
           more general information about IAM, see the IAM User Guide.
      All KMS keys must have a key policy. IAM policies are optional. To use an IAM policy to control 
      access to a KMS key, the key policy for the KMS key must give the account permission to use IAM 
      policies. Speciﬁcally, the key policy must include the policy statement that enables IAM policies.
      Permissions for AWS services                                                             96
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      IAM policies can control access to any AWS KMS operation. Unlike key policies, IAM policies can 
      control access to multiple KMS keys and provide permissions for the operations of several related 
      AWS services. But IAM policies are particularly useful for controlling access to operations, such as
      CreateKey, that can't be controlled by a key policy because they don't involve any particular KMS 
      key.
      If you access AWS KMS through an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoint, you 
      can also use a VPC endpoint policy to limit access to your AWS KMS resources when using the 
      endpoint. For example, when using the VPC endpoint, you might only allow the principals in your 
      AWS account to access your customer managed keys. For details, see VPC endpoint policies.
      For help writing and formatting a JSON policy document, see the IAM JSON Policy Reference in the
      IAM User Guide.
      You can use IAM policies in the following ways:
      • Attach a permissions policy to a role for federation or cross-account permissions – You 
        can attach an IAM policy to an IAM role to enable identity federation, allow cross-account 
        permissions, or give permissions to applications running on EC2 instances. For more information 
        about the various use cases for IAM roles, see IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide.
      • Attach a permissions policy to a user or a group – You can attach a policy that allows a user or 
        group of users to call AWS KMS operations. However, IAM best practices recommend that you 
        use identities with temporary credentials, such as IAM roles, whenever possible.
      The following example shows an IAM policy with AWS KMS permissions. This policy allows the IAM 
      identities to which it is attached to list all KMS keys and aliases.
        { 
          "Version": "2012-10-17", 
          "Statement": { 
            "Effect": "Allow", 
            "Action": [ 
              "kms:ListKeys", 
              "kms:ListAliases" 
            ], 
            "Resource": "*" 
          }
        }
      IAM policies                                                                             97

      Like all IAM policies, this policy doesn't have a Principal element. When you attach an IAM policy 
      to an IAM identity, that identity gets the permissions speciﬁed in the policy.
      For a table showing all of the AWS KMS API actions and the resources that they apply to, see the
      Permissions reference.
      Allowing multiple IAM principals to access a KMS key
      IAM groups are not valid principals in a key policy. To allow multiple users and roles to access a 
      KMS key, do one of the following:
      • Use an IAM role as the principal in the key policy. Multiple authorized users can assume the role 
        as needed. For details, see IAM roles in the IAM User Guide.
        While you can list multiple IAM users in a key policy, this practice is not recommended because 
        it requires that you update the key policy every time the list of authorized users changes. Also, 
        IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. For details, see
        Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
      • Use an IAM policy to give permission to an IAM group. To do this, ensure that the key policy 
        includes the statement that enables IAM policies to allow access to the KMS key, create an 
        IAM policy that allows access to the KMS key, and then attach that policy to an IAM group that 
        contains the authorized IAM users. Using this approach, you don't need to change any policies 
        when the list of authorized users changes. Instead, you only need to add or remove those users 
        from the appropriate IAM group. For details, see IAM user groups in the IAM User Guide
      For more information about how AWS KMS key policies and IAM policies work together, see
      Troubleshooting AWS KMS permissions.
      Best practices for IAM policies
      Securing access to AWS KMS keys is critical to the security of all of your AWS resources. KMS keys 
      are used to protect many of the most sensitive resources in your AWS account. Take the time to 
      design the key policies, IAM policies, grants, and VPC endpoint policies that control access to your 
      KMS keys.
      In IAM policy statements that control access to KMS keys, use the least privileged principle. Give 
      IAM principals only the permissions they need on only the KMS keys they must use or manage.
      Allowing multiple IAM principals to access a KMS key                                     98
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      The following best practices apply to IAM policies that control access to AWS KMS keys and aliases. 
      For general IAM policy best practice guidance, see Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User 
      Guide.
      Use key policies
         Whenever possible, provide permissions in key policies that aﬀect one KMS key, rather 
         than in an IAM policy that can apply to many KMS keys, including those in other AWS 
         accounts. This is particularly important for sensitive permissions like kms:PutKeyPolicy and
         kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion but also for cryptographic operations that determine how your data 
         is protected.
      Limit CreateKey permission
         Give permission to create keys (kms:CreateKey) only to principals who need it. Principals who 
         create a KMS key also set its key policy, so they can give themselves and others permission to 
         use and manage the KMS keys they create. When you allow this permission, consider limiting 
         it by using policy conditions. For example, you can use the kms:KeySpec condition to limit the 
         permission to symmetric encryption KMS keys.
      Specify KMS keys in an IAM policy
         As a best practice, specify the key ARN of each KMS key to which the permission applies in the
         Resource element of the policy statement. This practice restricts the permission to the KMS 
         keys that principal requires. For example, this Resource element lists only the KMS keys the 
         principal needs to use.
           "Resource": [ 
               "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab", 
               "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321"
           ]
         When specifying KMS keys is impractical, use a Resource value that limits access to KMS 
         keys in a trusted AWS account and Region, such as arn:aws:kms:region:account:key/*. 
         Or limit access to KMS keys in all Regions (*) of a trusted AWS account, such as
         arn:aws:kms:*:account:key/*.
         You cannot use a key ID, alias name, or alias ARN to represent a KMS key in the Resource ﬁeld 
         of an IAM policy. If you specify an alias ARN, the policy applies to the alias, not to the KMS key.

      Avoid "Resource": "*" in an IAM policy
         Use wildcard characters (*) judiciously. In a key policy, the wildcard character in the Resource
         element represents the KMS key to which the key policy is attached. But in an IAM policy, 
         a wildcard character alone in the Resource element ("Resource": "*") applies the 
         permissions to all KMS keys in all AWS accounts that the principal's account has permission to 
         use. This might include KMS keys in other AWS accounts, as well as KMS keys in the principal's 
         account.
         For example, to use a KMS key in another AWS account, a principal needs permission from the 
         key policy of the KMS key in the external account, and from an IAM policy in their own account. 
         Suppose that an arbitrary account gave your AWS account kms:Decrypt permission on their KMS 
         keys. If so, an IAM policy in your account that gives a role kms:Decrypt permission on all KMS 
         keys ("Resource": "*") would satisfy the IAM part of the requirement. As a result, principals 
         who can assume that role can now decrypt ciphertexts using the KMS key in the untrusted 
         account. Entries for their operations appear in the CloudTrail logs of both accounts.
         In particular, avoid using "Resource": "*" in a policy statement that allows the following API 
         operations. These operations can be called on KMS keys in other AWS accounts.
         • DescribeKey
         • GetKeyRotationStatus
         • Cryptographic operations (Encrypt, Decrypt, GenerateDataKey, GenerateDataKeyPair,
           GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext, GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext, GetPublicKey,
           ReEncrypt, Sign, Verify)
         • CreateGrant, ListGrants, ListRetirableGrants, RetireGrant, RevokeGrant
      When to use "Resource": "*"
         In an IAM policy, use a wildcard character in the Resource element only for permissions that 
         require it. Only the following permissions require the "Resource": "*" element.
         • kms:CreateKey
         • kms:GenerateRandom
         • kms:ListAliases
         • kms:ListKeys
         • Permissions for custom key stores, such as kms:CreateCustomKeyStore and
           kms:ConnectCustomKeyStore.

              Note
              Permissions for alias operations (kms:CreateAlias, kms:UpdateAlias, kms:DeleteAlias) 
              must be attached to the alias and the KMS key. You can use "Resource": "*" in an 
              IAM policy to represent the aliases and the KMS keys, or specify the aliases and KMS 
              keys in the Resource element. For examples, see Controlling access to aliases.
       
      The examples in this topic provide more information and guidance for designing IAM policies for 
      KMS keys. For IAM best practices for all AWS resources, see Security best practices in IAM in the IAM 
      User Guide.
      Specifying KMS keys in IAM policy statements
      You can use an IAM policy to allow a principal to use or manage KMS keys. KMS keys are speciﬁed 
      in the Resource element of the policy statement.
      • To specify a KMS key in an IAM policy statement, you must use its key ARN. You cannot use a key 
        id, alias name, or alias ARN to identify a KMS key in an IAM policy statement.
        For example: "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-
        west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
        To control access to a KMS key based on its aliases, use the kms:RequestAlias or
        kms:ResourceAliases condition keys. For details, see ABAC for AWS KMS.
        Use an alias ARN as the resource only in a policy statement that controls access to alias 
        operations, such as CreateAlias, UpdateAlias, or DeleteAlias. For details, see Controlling access to 
        aliases.
      • To specify multiple KMS keys in the account and Region, use wildcard characters (*) in the Region 
        or resource ID positions of the key ARN.
        For example, to specify all KMS keys in the US West (Oregon) Region of an account, use 
        "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/*". To specify all KMS keys in 
        all Regions of the account, use "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:*:111122223333:key/*".
      Specifying KMS keys in IAM policy statements                                        101
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      •
        To represent all KMS keys, use a wildcard character alone ("*"). Use this format for operations 
        that don't use any particular KMS key, namely CreateKey, GenerateRandom, ListAliases, and
        ListKeys.
      When writing your policy statements, it's a best practice to specify only the KMS keys that the 
      principal needs to use, rather than giving them access to all KMS keys.
      For example, the following IAM policy statement allows the principal to call the DescribeKey,
      GenerateDataKey, Decrypt operations only on the KMS keys listed in the Resource element of 
      the policy statement. Specifying KMS keys by key ARN, which is a best practice, ensures that the 
      permissions are limited only to the speciﬁed KMS keys.
        { 
          "Version": "2012-10-17", 
          "Statement": { 
            "Effect": "Allow", 
            "Action": [ 
              "kms:DescribeKey", 
              "kms:GenerateDataKey", 
              "kms:Decrypt" 
            ], 
            "Resource": [ 
              "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab", 
              "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321" 
            ] 
          }
        }
      To apply the permission to all KMS keys in a particular trusted AWS account, you can use wildcard 
      characters (*) in the Region and key ID positions. For example, the following policy statement 
      allows the principal to call the speciﬁed operations on all KMS keys in two trusted example 
      accounts.
        { 
          "Version": "2012-10-17", 
          "Statement": { 
            "Effect": "Allow", 
            "Action": [ 
              "kms:DescribeKey",

        }
      You can also use a wildcard character ("*") alone in the Resource element. Because it allows 
      access to all KMS keys the account has permission to use, it's recommended primarily for 
      operations without a particular KMS key and for Deny statements. You can also use it in policy 
      statements that allow only less sensitive read-only operations. To determine whether an AWS KMS 
      operation involves a particular KMS key, look for the KMS key value in the Resources column of the 
      table in the section called “Permissions reference”.
      For example, the following policy statement uses a Deny eﬀect to prohibit the principals from 
      using the speciﬁed operations on any KMS key. It uses a wildcard character in the Resource
      element to represent all KMS keys.
        { 
          "Version": "2012-10-17", 
          "Statement": { 
            "Effect": "Deny", 
            "Action": [ 
              "kms:CreateKey", 
              "kms:PutKeyPolicy", 
              "kms:CreateGrant",

            ], 
            "Resource": "*" 
          }
        }
      The following policy statement uses a wildcard character alone to represent all KMS keys. But it 
      allows only less sensitive read-only operations and operations that don't apply to any particular 
      KMS key.

      IAM policy examples
      In this section, you can ﬁnd example IAM policies that allow permissions for various AWS KMS 
      actions.
           Important
           Some of the permissions in the following policies are allowed only when the KMS key's key 
           policy also allows them. For more information, see Permissions reference.
      For help writing and formatting a JSON policy document, see the IAM JSON Policy Reference in the
      IAM User Guide.
      Examples
      • Allow a user to view KMS keys in the AWS KMS console
      • Allow a user to create KMS keys
      • Allow a user to encrypt and decrypt with any KMS key in a speciﬁc AWS account
      • Allow a user to encrypt and decrypt with any KMS key in a speciﬁc AWS account and Region
      • Allow a user to encrypt and decrypt with speciﬁc KMS keys
      • Prevent a user from disabling or deleting any KMS keys
      Allow a user to view KMS keys in the AWS KMS console
      The following IAM policy allows users read-only access to the AWS KMS console. Users with these 
      permissions can view all KMS keys in their AWS account, but they cannot create or change any KMS 
      keys.
      Examples                                                                                104
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      To view KMS keys on the AWS managed keys and Customer managed keys pages, principals 
      require kms:ListKeys, kms:ListAliases, and tag:GetResources permissions, even if the keys do not 
      have tags or aliases. The remaining permissions, particularly kms:DescribeKey, are required to 
      view optional KMS key table columns and data on the KMS key detail pages. The iam:ListUsers
      and iam:ListRoles permissions are required to display the key policy in default view without error. 
      To view data on the Custom key stores page and details about KMS keys in custom key stores, 
      principals also need kms:DescribeCustomKeyStores permission.
      If you limit a user's console access to particular KMS keys, the console displays an error for each 
      KMS key that is not visible.
      This policy includes of two policy statements. The Resource element in the ﬁrst policy statement 
      allows the speciﬁed permissions on all KMS keys in all Regions of the example AWS account. 
      Console viewers don't need additional access because the AWS KMS console displays only KMS keys 
      in the principal's account. This is true even if they have permission to view KMS keys in other AWS 
      accounts. The remaining AWS KMS and IAM permissions require a "Resource": "*" element 
      because they don't apply to any particular KMS key.

        }
      Allow a user to create KMS keys
      The following IAM policy allows a user to create all types of KMS keys. The value of the Resource
      element is * because the CreateKey operation does not use any particular AWS KMS resources 
      (KMS keys or aliases).
      To restrict the user to particular types of KMS keys, use the kms:KeySpec, kms:KeyUsage, and
      kms:KeyOrigin condition keys.
        { 
          "Version": "2012-10-17", 
          "Statement": { 
            "Effect": "Allow", 
            "Action": "kms:CreateKey", 
            "Resource": "*" 
          }
        }
      Principals who create keys might need some related permissions.
      •
        kms:PutKeyPolicy — Principals who have kms:CreateKey permission can set the initial 
        key policy for the KMS key. However, the CreateKey caller must have kms:PutKeyPolicy
        permission, which lets them change the KMS key policy, or they must specify the
        BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck parameter of CreateKey, which is not recommended. 
        The CreateKey caller can get kms:PutKeyPolicy permission for the KMS key from an IAM 
        policy or they can include this permission in the key policy of the KMS key that they're creating.
      •
        kms:TagResource — To add tags to the KMS key during the CreateKey operation, the
        CreateKey caller must have kms:TagResource permission in an IAM policy. Including this 
        permission in the key policy of the new KMS key isn't suﬃcient. However, if the CreateKey
        caller includes kms:TagResource in the initial key policy, they can add tags in a separate call 
        after the KMS key is created.
      Examples                                                                                106

      • kms:CreateAlias — Principals who create a KMS key in the AWS KMS console must have
        kms:CreateAlias permission on the KMS key and on the alias. (The console makes two calls; one 
        to CreateKey and one to CreateAlias). You must provide the alias permission in an IAM 
        policy. You can provide the KMS key permission in a key policy or IAM policy. For details, see
        Controlling access to aliases.
      In addition to kms:CreateKey, the following IAM policy provides kms:TagResource permission 
      on all KMS keys in the AWS account and kms:CreateAlias permission on all aliases that the 
      account. It also includes some useful read-only permissions that can be provided only in an IAM 
      policy.
      This IAM policy does not include kms:PutKeyPolicy permission or any other permissions that 
      can be set in a key policy. It's a best practice to set these permissions in the key policy where they 
      apply exclusively to one KMS key.

      Resource control policies in AWS KMS
      Resource control policies (RCPs) are a type of organization policy that you can use to enforce 
      preventive controls on AWS resources in your organization. RCPs help you to centrally restrict 
      external access to your AWS resources at scale. RCPs complement service control policies (SCPs). 
      While, SCPs can be used to centrally set the maximum permissions on the IAM roles and users in 
      your organization, RCPs can be used to centrally set the maximum permissions on AWS resources in 
      your organization.
      You can use RCPs to manage permissions to the customer managed KMS keys in your organization. 
      RCPs alone are not suﬃcient in granting permissions to your customer managed keys. No 
      permissions are granted by an RCP. An RCP deﬁnes a permissions guardrail, or sets limits, on the 
      actions that identities can take on resources in the aﬀected accounts. The administrator must still 
      attach identity-based policies to IAM roles or users, or key policies to actually grant permissions.
           Note
           Resource control policies in your organization do not apply to AWS managed keys.
           AWS managed keys are created, managed, and used on your behalf by an AWS service, you 
           cannot change or manage their permissions.
      Learn more
      • For more general information on RCPs, see Resource control policies in the AWS Organizations 
        User Guide.
      • For details on how to deﬁne RCPs, including examples, see RCP syntax in the AWS Organizations 
        User Guide.
      The following example demonstrates how to use an RCP to prevent external principals from 
      accessing customer managed keys in your organization. This policy is just a sample, and you 
      should tailor it to meet your unique business and security needs. For example, you might want 
      to customize your policy to allow access by your business partners. For more details, see the data 
      perimeter policy examples repository.

           Note
           The kms:RetireGrant permission is not eﬀective in an RCP, even if the Action element 
           speciﬁes an asterisk (*) as a wildcard.

           and revoking grants.

                } 
            ]
        }
      The following example RCP requires that AWS service principals can only access your customer 
      managed KMS keys when the request originates from your organization. This policy applies 
      the control only on requests that have aws:SourceAccount present. This ensures that 
      service integrations that don't require the use of aws:SourceAccount aren't aﬀected. If
      aws:SourceAccount is present in the request context, the Null condition evaluates to true, 
      causing the aws:SourceOrgID key to be enforced.

      Grants in AWS KMS
      A grant is a policy instrument that allows AWS principals to use KMS keys in cryptographic 
      operations. It also can let them view a KMS key (DescribeKey) and create and manage grants. 
      When authorizing access to a KMS key, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM 
      policies. Grants are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its 
      permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies.
      Grants are commonly used by AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS to encrypt your data at 
      rest. The service creates a grant on behalf of a user in the account, uses its permissions, and retires 
      the grant as soon as its task is complete. For details about how AWS services, use grants, see the
      Encryption at rest topic in the service's user guide or developer guide.
      Grants are a very ﬂexible and useful access control mechanism. When you create a grant for a KMS 
      key, the grant allows the grantee principal to call the speciﬁed grant operations on the KMS key 
      provided that all conditions speciﬁed in the grant are met.
      Grants                                                                                  112

      • Each grant allows access to exactly one KMS key. You can create a grant for a KMS key in a 
        diﬀerent AWS account.
      • A grant can allow access to a KMS key, but not deny access.
      • Each grant has one grantee principal. The grantee principal can represent one or more identities 
        in the same AWS account as the KMS key or in a diﬀerent account.
      • A grant can only allow grant operations. The grant operations must be supported by the KMS 
        key in the grant. If you specify an unsupported operation, the CreateGrant request fails with a
        ValidationError exception.
      • The grantee principal can use the permissions that the grant gives them without specifying 
        the grant, just as they would if the permissions came from a key policy or IAM policy. However, 
        because the AWS KMS API follows an eventual consistency model, when you create, retire, or 
        revoke a grant, there might be a brief delay, before the change is available throughout AWS KMS. 
        To use the permissions in a grant immediately, use a grant token.
      • An authorized principal can delete the grant (retire or revoke it). Deleting a grant eliminates 
        all permissions that the grant allowed. You do not have to ﬁgure out which policies to add or 
        remove to undo the grant.
      • AWS KMS limits the number of grants on each KMS key. For details, see Grants per KMS key: 
        50,000.
      Be cautious when creating grants and when giving others permission to create grants. Permission 
      to create grants has security implications, much like allowing the kms:PutKeyPolicy permission to 
      set policies.
      •
        Users with permission to create grants for a KMS key (kms:CreateGrant) can use a grant to 
        allow users and roles, including AWS services, to use the KMS key. The principals can be identities 
        in your own AWS account or identities in a diﬀerent account or organization.
      • Grants can allow only a subset of AWS KMS operations. You can use grants to allow principals 
        to view the KMS key, use it in cryptographic operations, and create and retire grants. For details, 
        see Grant operations. You can also use grant constraints to limit the permissions in a grant for a 
        symmetric encryption key.
      • Principals can get permission to create grants from a key policy or IAM policy. Principals who get
        kms:CreateGrant permission from a policy can create grants for any grant operation on the 
        KMS key. These principals are not required to have the permission that they are granting on the 
        key. When you allow kms:CreateGrant permission in a policy, you can use policy conditions to 
        limit this permission.
      Grants                                                                             113

      • Principals can also get permission to create grants from a grant. These principals can only 
        delegate the permissions that they were granted, even if they have other permissions from a 
        policy. For details, see Granting CreateGrant permission.
      Grant concepts
      To use grants eﬀectively, you'll need to understand the terms and concepts that AWS KMS uses.
      Grant constraint
         A condition that limits the permissions in the grant. Currently, AWS KMS supports grant 
         constraints based on the encryption context in the request for a cryptographic operation. For 
         details, see Using grant constraints.
      Grant ID
         The unique identiﬁer of a grant for a KMS key. You can use a grant ID, along with a key 
         identiﬁer, to identify a grant in a RetireGrant or RevokeGrant request.
      Grant operations
         The AWS KMS operations that you can allow in a grant. If you specify other operations, the
         CreateGrant request fails with a ValidationError exception. These are also the operations 
         that accept a grant token. For detailed information about these permissions, see the AWS KMS 
         permissions.
         These grant operations actually represent permission to use the operation. Therefore, for the
         ReEncrypt operation, you can specify ReEncryptFrom, ReEncryptTo, or both ReEncrypt*.
         The grant operations are:
         • Cryptographic operations
           • Decrypt
           • DeriveSharedSecret
           • Encrypt
           • GenerateDataKey
           • GenerateDataKeyPair
           • GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext
           • GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
      Grant concepts                                                                          114
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
           • GenerateMac
           • ReEncryptFrom
           • ReEncryptTo
           • Sign
           • Verify
           • VerifyMac
         • Other operations
           • CreateGrant
           • DescribeKey
           • GetPublicKey
           • RetireGrant
         The grant operations that you allow must be supported by the KMS key in the grant. If you 
         specify an unsupported operation, the CreateGrant request fails with a ValidationError
         exception. For example, grants for symmetric encryption KMS keys cannot allow the Sign,
         Verify, GenerateMac or VerifyMac operations. Grants for asymmetric KMS keys cannot allow 
         any operations that generate data keys or data key pairs.
      Grant token
         The AWS KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. When you create a grant, there might 
         be a brief delay before the change is available throughout AWS KMS. It typically takes less than 
         a few seconds for the change to propagate throughout the system, but in some cases it can take 
         several minutes. If you try to use a grant before it fully propagates through the system, you 
         might get an access denied error. A grant token lets you refer to the grant and use the grant 
         permissions immediately.
         A grant token is a unique, nonsecret, variable-length, base64-encoded string that represents 
         a grant. You can use the grant token to identify the grant in any grant operation. However, 
         because the token value is a hash digest, it doesn't reveal any details about the grant.
         A grant token is designed to be used only until the grant has fully propagated throughout AWS 
         KMS. After that, the grantee principal can use the permission in the grant without providing a 
         grant token or any other evidence of the grant. You can use a grant token at any time, but once 
         the grant is eventually consistent, AWS KMS uses the grant to determine permissions, not the 
         grant token.
      Grant concepts                                                                          115
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
         For example, the following command calls the GenerateDataKey operation. It uses a grant 
         token to represent the grant that gives the caller (the grantee principal) permission to call
         GenerateDataKey on the speciﬁed KMS key.
           $ aws kms generate-data-key \ 
                   --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
                   --key-spec AES_256 \ 
                   --grant-token $token
         You can also use a grant token to identify a grant in operations that manage grants. For 
         example, the retiring principal can use a grant token in a call to the RetireGrant operation.
           $ aws kms retire-grant \ 
                   --grant-token $token
         CreateGrant is the only operation that returns a grant token. You cannot get a grant token 
         from any other AWS KMS operation or from the CloudTrail log event for the CreateGrant 
         operation. The ListGrants and ListRetirableGrants operations return the grant ID, but not a 
         grant token.
         For details, see Using a grant token.
      Grantee principal
         The identities that get the permissions speciﬁed in the grant. Each grant has one grantee 
         principal, but the grantee principal can represent multiple identities.
         The grantee principal can be any AWS principal, including an AWS account (root), an IAM user, 
         an IAM role, a federated role or user, or an assumed role user. The grantee principal can be in 
         the same account as the KMS key or a diﬀerent account. However, the grantee principal cannot 
         be a service principal, an IAM group, or an AWS organization.
              Note
              IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. 
              Whenever possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, see
              Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
      Grant concepts                                                                          116

      Retire (a grant)
         Terminates a grant. You retire a grant when you ﬁnish using the permissions.
         Revoking and retiring a grant both delete the grant. But retiring is done by a principal speciﬁed 
         in the grant. Revoking is typically done by a key administrator. For details, see Retiring and 
         revoking grants.
      Retiring principal
         A principal who can retire a grant. You can specify a retiring principal in a grant, but it is not 
         required. The retiring principal can be any AWS principal, including AWS accounts, IAM users, 
         IAM roles, federated users, and assumed role users. The retiring principal can be in the same 
         account as the KMS key or a diﬀerent account.
             Note
             IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. 
             Whenever possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, see
             Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
         In addition to retiring principal speciﬁed in the grant, a grant can be retired by the AWS account 
         in which the grant was created. If the grant allows the RetireGrant operation, the grantee 
         principal can retire the grant. Also, the AWS account or an AWS account that is the retiring 
         principal can delegate the permission to retire a grant to an IAM principal in the same AWS 
         account. For details, see Retiring and revoking grants.
      Revoke (a grant)
         Terminates a grant. You revoke a grant to actively deny the permissions that the grant allows.
         Revoking and retiring a grant both delete the grant. But retiring is done by a principal speciﬁed 
         in the grant. Revoking is typically done by a key administrator. For details, see Retiring and 
         revoking grants.
      Eventual consistency (for grants)
         The AWS KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. When you create, retire, or revoke 
         a grant, there might be a brief delay before the change is available throughout AWS KMS. It 
         typically takes less than a few seconds for the change to propagate throughout the system, but 
         in some cases it can take several minutes.
      Grant concepts                                                                117
      AWS Key Management Service                                             Developer Guide
         You might become aware of this brief delay if you get unexpected errors. For example, If you 
         try to manage a new grant or use the permissions in a new grant before the grant is known 
         throughout AWS KMS, you might get an access denied error. If you retire or revoke a grant, the 
         grantee principal might still be able to use its permissions for a brief period until the grant is 
         fully deleted. The typical strategy is to retry the request, and some AWS SDKs include automatic 
         backoﬀ and retry logic.
         AWS KMS has features to mitigate this brief delay.
         • To use the permissions in a new grant immediately, use a grant token. You can use a grant 
          token to refer to a grant in any grant operation. For instructions, see Using a grant token.
         •
          The CreateGrant operation has a Name parameter that prevents retry operations from 
          creating duplicate grants.
             Note
             Grant tokens supersede the validity of the grant until all endpoints in the service have 
             been updated with the new grant state. In most cases, eventual consistency will be 
             achieved within ﬁve minutes.
         For more information, see AWS KMS eventual consistency.
      Best practices for AWS KMS grants
      AWS KMS recommends the following best practices when creating, using, and managing grants.
      • Limit the permissions in the grant to those that the grantee principal requires. Use the principle 
        of least privileged access.
      • Use a speciﬁc grantee principal, such as an IAM role, and give the grantee principal permission to 
        use only the API operations that they require.
      • Use the encryption context grant constraints to ensure that callers are using the KMS key for 
        the intended purpose. For details about how to use the encryption context in a request to 
        secure your data, see How to Protect the Integrity of Your Encrypted Data by Using AWS Key 
        Management Service and EncryptionContext in the AWS Security Blog.
      Best practices                                                                118
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
             Tip
             Use the EncryptionContextEqual grant constraint whenever possible. The
             EncryptionContextSubset grant constraint is more diﬃcult to use correctly. If you need 
             to use it, read the documentation carefully and test the grant constraint to make sure it 
             works as intended.
      • Delete duplicate grants. Duplicate grants have the same key ARN, API actions, grantee principal, 
        encryption context, and name. If you retire or revoke the original grant but leave the duplicates, 
        the leftover duplicate grants constitute unintended escalations of privilege. To avoid duplicating 
        grants when retrying a CreateGrant request, use the Name parameter. To detect duplicate 
        grants, use the ListGrants operation. If you accidentally create a duplicate grant, retire or revoke 
        it as soon as possible.
             Note
             Grants for AWS managed keys might look like duplicates but have diﬀerent grantee 
             principals.
             The GranteePrincipal ﬁeld in the ListGrants response usually contains the 
             grantee principal of the grant. However, when the grantee principal in the grant is an 
             AWS service, the GranteePrincipal ﬁeld contains the service principal, which might 
             represent several diﬀerent grantee principals.
      • Remember that grants do not automatically expire. Retire or revoke the grant as soon as the 
        permission is no longer needed. Grants that are not deleted might create a security risk for 
        encrypted resources.
      Controlling access to grants
      You can control access to the operations that create and manage grants in key policies, IAM 
      policies, and in grants. Principals who get CreateGrant permission from a grant have more 
      limited grant permissions.

       When you use a key policy or IAM policy to control access to operations that create and manage 
       grants, you can use one or more of the following policy conditions to limit the permission. AWS 
       KMS supports all of the following grant-related condition keys. For detailed information and 
       examples, see AWS KMS condition keys.
       kms:GrantConstraintType
          Allows principals to create a grant only when the grant includes the speciﬁed grant constraint.
       kms:GrantIsForAWSResource
          Allows principals to call CreateGrant, ListGrants, or RevokeGrant only when an AWS 
          service that is integrated with AWS KMS sends the request on the principal's behalf.
       kms:GrantOperations
          Allows principals to create a grant, but limits the grant to the speciﬁed operations.
       kms:GranteePrincipal
          Allows principals to create a grant only for the speciﬁed grantee principal.
       kms:RetiringPrincipal
          Allows principals to create a grant only when the grant speciﬁes a particular retiring principal.

      Creating a grant
      To create a grant, call the CreateGrant operation. Specify a KMS key, a grantee principal, and a list 
      of allowed grant operations. You can also designate an optional retiring principal. To customize the 
      grant, use optional Constraints parameters to deﬁne grant constraints.
      When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief delay, usually less than ﬁve 
      minutes, before the change is available throughout AWS KMS. For more information, see Eventual 
      consistency (for grants).
      For example, the following CreateGrant command creates a grant that allows users who are 
      authorized to assume the keyUserRole role to call the Decrypt operation on the speciﬁed
      symmetric KMS key. The grant uses the RetiringPrincipal parameter to designate a principal 
      that can retire the grant. It also includes a grant constraint that allows the permission only when 
      the encryption context in the request includes "Department": "IT".
        $  aws kms create-grant \ 
            --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
            --grantee-principal arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/keyUserRole \

            --constraints EncryptionContextSubset={Department=IT}
      If your code retries the CreateGrant operation, or uses an AWS SDK that automatically retries 
      requests, use the optional Name parameter to prevent the creation of duplicate grants. If AWS KMS 
      gets a CreateGrant request for a grant with the same properties as an existing grant, including 
      the name, it recognizes the request as a retry, and does not create a new grant. You cannot use the
      Name value to identify the grant in any AWS KMS operations.

      Using grant constraints
      Grant constraints set conditions on the permissions that the grant gives to the grantee principal. 
      Grant constraints take the place of condition keys in a key policy or IAM policy. Each grant 
      constraint value can include up to 8 encryption context pairs. The encryption context value in each 
      grant constraint cannot exceed 384 characters.
           Important
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be displayed 
           in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      AWS KMS supports two grant constraints, EncryptionContextEquals and
      EncryptionContextSubset, both of which establish requirements for the encryption context in 
      a request for a cryptographic operation.
      The encryption context grant constraints are designed to be used with grant operations that have 
      an encryption context parameter.
      • Encryption context constraints are valid only in a grant for a symmetric encryption KMS key. 
        Cryptographic operations with other KMS keys don't support an encryption context.

      •
        The encryption context constraint is ignored for DescribeKey and RetireGrant operations.
        DescribeKey and RetireGrant don't have an encryption context parameter, but you can 
        include these operations in a grant that has an encryption context constraint.
      •
        You can use an encryption context constraint in a grant for the CreateGrant operation. 
        The encryption context constraint requires that any grants created with the CreateGrant
        permission have an equally strict or stricter encryption context constraint.
      AWS KMS supports the following encryption context grant constraints.
      EncryptionContextEquals
         Use EncryptionContextEquals to specify the exact encryption context for permitted 
         requests.
         EncryptionContextEquals requires that the encryption context pairs in the request are an 
         exact, case-sensitive match for the encryption context pairs in the grant constraint. The pairs 
         can appear in any order, but the keys and values in each pair cannot vary.
         For example, if the EncryptionContextEquals grant constraint requires the
         "Department": "IT" encryption context pair, the grant allows requests of the speciﬁed type 
         only when the encryption context in the request is exactly "Department": "IT".
      EncryptionContextSubset
         Use EncryptionContextSubset to require that requests include particular encryption 
         context pairs.
         EncryptionContextSubset requires that the request include all encryption context pairs in 
         the grant constraint (an exact, case-sensitive match), but the request can also have additional 
         encryption context pairs. The pairs can appear in any order, but the keys and values in each pair 
         cannot vary.
         For example, if the EncryptionContextSubset grant constraint requires the
         Department=IT encryption context pair, the grant allows requests of the speciﬁed type when 
         the encryption context in the request is "Department": "IT", or includes "Department": 
         "IT" along with other encryption context pairs, such as "Department": "IT","Purpose": 
         "Test".
      Creating grants                                                                        123

      To specify an encryption context constraint in a grant for a symmetric encryption KMS key, use 
      the Constraints parameter in the CreateGrant operation. The grant that this command creates 
      gives users who are authorized to assume the keyUserRole role permission to call the Decrypt
      operation. But that permission is eﬀective only when the encryption context in the Decrypt
      request is a "Department": "IT" encryption context pair.
        $ aws kms create-grant \ 
            --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
            --grantee-principal arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/keyUserRole \ 
            --operations Decrypt \ 
            --retiring-principal arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/adminRole \
            --constraints EncryptionContextEquals={Department=IT}
      The resulting grant looks like the following one. Notice that the permission granted to the
      keyUserRole role is eﬀective only when the Decrypt request uses the same encryption context 
      pair speciﬁed in the grant constraint. To ﬁnd the grants on a KMS key, use the ListGrants operation.
        $ aws kms list-grants --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

      To satisfy the EncryptionContextEquals grant constraint, the encryption context in the 
      request for the Decrypt operation must be a "Department": "IT" pair. A request like the 
      following from the grantee principal would satisfy the EncryptionContextEquals grant 
      constraint.
        $ aws kms decrypt \ 
            --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-
        west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab\ 
            --ciphertext-blob fileb://encrypted_msg \ 
            --encryption-context Department=IT
      When the grant constraint is EncryptionContextSubset, the encryption context pairs in the 
      request must include the encryption context pairs in the grant constraint, but the request can 
      also include other encryption context pairs. The following grant constraint requires that one of 
      encryption context pairs in the request is "Deparment": "IT".
        "Constraints": { 
           "EncryptionContextSubset": { 
               "Department": "IT" 
           }
        }
      The following request from the grantee principal would satisfy both of the
      EncryptionContextEqual and EncryptionContextSubset grant constraints in this example.
        $ aws kms decrypt \ 
            --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-
        west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \

            --encryption-context Department=IT
      However, a request like the following from the grantee principal would satisfy the
      EncryptionContextSubset grant constraint, but it would fail the EncryptionContextEquals
      grant constraint.
        $ aws kms decrypt \ 
            --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-

      AWS services often use encryption context constraints in the grants that give them permission 
      to use KMS keys in your AWS account. For example, Amazon DynamoDB uses a grant like the 
      following one to get permission to use the AWS managed key for DynamoDB in your account. 
      The EncryptionContextSubset grant constraint in this grant makes the permissions in the 
      grant eﬀective only when the encryption context in the request includes "subscriberID": 
      "111122223333" and "tableName": "Services" pairs. This grant constraint means that 
      the grant allows DynamoDB to use the speciﬁed KMS key only for a particular table in your AWS 
      account.
      To get this output, run the ListGrants operation on the AWS managed key for DynamoDB in your 
      account.

      Granting CreateGrant permission
      A grant can include permission to call the CreateGrant operation. But when a grantee principal
      gets permission to call CreateGrant from a grant, rather than from a policy, that permission is 
      limited.
      • The grantee principal can only create grants that allow some or all of the operations in the 
        parent grant.
      • The grant constraints in the grants they create must be at least as strict as those in the parent 
        grant.
      These limitations don't apply to principals who get CreateGrant permission from a policy, 
      although their permissions can be limited by policy conditions.
      For example, consider a grant that allows the grantee principal to call the GenerateDataKey,
      Decrypt, and CreateGrant operations. We call a grant that allow CreateGrant permission a
      parent grant.

      The grantee principal, exampleUser, can use this permission to create a grant that includes any 
      subset of the operations speciﬁed in the original grant, such as CreateGrant and Decrypt. The
      child grant cannot include other operations, such as ScheduleKeyDeletion or ReEncrypt.
      Also, the grant constraints in child grants must be as restrictive or more restrictive than those in 
      the parent grant. For example, the child grant can add pairs to an EncryptionContextSubset
      constraint in the parent grant, but it cannot remove them. The child grant can change an
      EncryptionContextSubset constraint to an EncryptionContextEquals constraint, but not 
      the reverse.
      IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. Whenever possible, 
      use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, see Security best practices in IAM in 
      the IAM User Guide.
      For example, the grantee principal can use the CreateGrant permission that it got from the 
      parent grant to create the following child grant. The operations in the child grant are a subset of 
      the operations in the parent grant and the grant constraints are more restrictive.

      The grantee principal in the child grant, anotherUser, can use their CreateGrant permission to 
      create grants. However, the grants that anotherUser creates must include the operations in its 
      parent grant or a subset, and the grant constraints must be the same or stricter.
      Viewing grants
      To view the grant, use the ListGrants operation. You must specify the KMS key to which the grants 
      apply. You can also ﬁlter the grant list by grant ID or grantee principal. For more examples, see Use
      ListGrants with an AWS SDK or CLI.
      To view all grants in the AWS account and Region with a particular retiring principal, use
      ListRetirableGrants. The responses include details about each grant.
           Note
           The GranteePrincipal ﬁeld in the ListGrants response usually contains the grantee 
           principal of the grant. However, when the grantee principal in the grant is an AWS service, 
           the GranteePrincipal ﬁeld contains the service principal, which might represent several 
           diﬀerent grantee principals.
      For example, the following command lists all of the grants for a KMS key.
        $  aws kms list-grants --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

            ]

      Using a grant token
      The AWS KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. When you create a grant, the grant 
      might not be eﬀective immediately. There might be a brief delay before the change is available 
      throughout AWS KMS. It typically takes less than a few seconds for the change to propagate 
      throughout the system, but in some cases it can take several minutes. Once the change has 
      fully propagated throughout the system, the grantee principal can use the permissions in 
      the grant without specifying the grant token or any evidence of the grant. However, if a 
      grant that is so new that it is not yet known to all of AWS KMS, the request might fail with an
      AccessDeniedException error.
      To use the permissions in a new grant immediately, use the grant token for the grant. Save the 
      grant token that the CreateGrant operation returns. Then submit the grant token in the request for 
      the AWS KMS operation. You can submit a grant token to any AWS KMS grant operation and you 
      can submit multiple grant tokens in the same request.
      The following example uses the CreateGrant operation to create a grant that allows the
      GenerateDataKey and Decrypt operations. It saves the grant token that CreateGrant returns in 
      the token variable. Then, in a call to the GenerateDataKey operation, it uses the grant token in 
      the token variable.
        # Create a grant; save the grant token 
        $ token=$(aws kms create-grant \ 
      Using a grant token                                                                     130

        $ aws kms generate-data-key \ 
            --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
            –-key-spec AES_256 \ 
            --grant-tokens $token
      Principals with permission can also use a grant token to retire a new grant even before the grant is 
      available throughout AWS KMS. (The RevokeGrant operation doesn't accept a grant token.) For 
      details, see Retiring and revoking grants.
        # Retire the grant
        $ aws kms retire-grant --grant-token $token
      Retiring and revoking grants
      To delete a grant, retire or revoke it.
      The RetireGrant and RevokeGrant operations are very similar to each other. Both operations delete 
      a grant, which eliminates the permissions the grant allows. The primary diﬀerence between these 
      operations is how they are authorized.
      RevokeGrant
         Like most AWS KMS operations, access to the RevokeGrant operation is controlled through
         key policies and IAM policies. The RevokeGrant API can be called by any principal with
         kms:RevokeGrant permission. This permission is included in the standard permissions given 
         to key administrators. Typically, administrators revoke a grant to deny permissions the grant 
         allows.
      RetireGrant
         The grant determines who can retire it. This design allows you to control the lifecycle of a grant 
         without changing key policies or IAM policies. Typically, you retire a grant when you are done 
         using its permissions.
      Retiring and revoking grants                                                            131
      AWS Key Management Service                                            Developer Guide
        A grant can be retired by an optional retiring principal speciﬁed in the grant. The grantee 
        principal can also retire the grant, but only if they are also a retiring principal or the grant 
        includes the RetireGrant operation. As a backup, the AWS account in which the grant was 
        created can retire the grant.
        There is a kms:RetireGrant permission that can be used in IAM policies, but it has limited 
        utility. Principals speciﬁed in the grant can retire a grant without the kms:RetireGrant
        permission. The kms:RetireGrant permission alone does not allow principals to retire a 
        grant. The kms:RetireGrant permission is not eﬀective in a key policy or resource control 
        policy.
        •
          To deny permission to retire a grant, you can use a Deny action with the kms:RetireGrant
          permission in your IAM policies.
        •
          The AWS account that owns the KMS key can delegate the kms:RetireGrant permission to 
          an IAM principal in the account.
        • If the retiring principal is a diﬀerent AWS account, administrators in the other account can 
          use kms:RetireGrant to delegate permission to retire the grant to an IAM principal in that 
          account.
      The AWS KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. When you create, retire, or revoke a 
      grant, there might be a brief delay before the change is available throughout AWS KMS. It typically 
      takes less than a few seconds for the change to propagate throughout the system, but in some 
      cases it can take several minutes. If you need to delete a new grant immediately, before it is 
      available throughout AWS KMS, use a grant token to retire the grant. You cannot use a grant token 
      to revoke a grant.
      Condition keys for AWS KMS
      You can specify conditions in the key policies and IAM policies that control access to AWS KMS 
      resources. The policy statement is eﬀective only when the conditions are true. For example, you 
      might want a policy statement to take eﬀect only after a speciﬁc date. Or, you might want a policy 
      statement to control access only when a speciﬁc value appears in an API request.
      To specify conditions, you use condition keys in the Condition element of a policy statement with
      IAM condition operators. Some condition keys apply generally to AWS; others are speciﬁc to AWS 
      KMS.
      Condition keys                                                               132

      Condition key values must adhere to the character and encoding rules for AWS KMS key policies 
      and IAM policies. For details about key policy document rules, see Key policy format. For details 
      about IAM policy document rules, see IAM name requirements in the IAM User Guide..

      AWS global condition keys
      AWS deﬁnes global condition keys, a set of policy conditions keys for all AWS services that use IAM 
      for access control. AWS KMS supports all global condition keys. You can use them in AWS KMS key 
      policies and IAM policies.
      For example, you can use the aws:PrincipalArn global condition key to allow access to an AWS KMS 
      key (KMS key) only when the principal in the request is represented by the Amazon Resource Name 
      (ARN) in the condition key value. To support attribute-based access control (ABAC) in AWS KMS, 
      you can use the aws:ResourceTag/tag-key global condition key in an IAM policy to allow access to 
      KMS keys with a particular tag.
      To help prevent an AWS service from being used as a confused deputy in a policy where the 
      principal is an AWS service principal, you can use the aws:SourceArn or aws:SourceAccount global 
      condition keys. For details, see Using aws:SourceArn or aws:SourceAccount condition keys.
      For information about AWS global condition keys, including the types of requests in which they 
      are available, see AWS Global Condition Context Keys in the IAM User Guide. For examples of using 
      global condition keys in IAM policies, see Controlling Access to Requests and Controlling Tag Keys
      in the IAM User Guide.
      The following topics provide special guidance for using condition keys based on IP addresses and 
      VPC endpoints.

      Using the IP address condition in policies with AWS KMS permissions
      You can use AWS KMS to protect your data in an integrated AWS service. But use caution when 
      specifying the IP address condition operators or the aws:SourceIp condition key in the same 
      policy statement that allows or denies access to AWS KMS. For example, the policy in AWS: Denies 
      Access to AWS Based on the Source IP restricts AWS actions to requests from the speciﬁed IP range.
      Consider this scenario:
      1. You attach a policy like the one shown at AWS: Denies Access to AWS Based on the Source IP
         to an IAM identity. You set the value of the aws:SourceIp condition key to the range of IP 
         addresses for the user's company. This IAM identity has other policies attached that allow it to 
         use Amazon EBS, Amazon EC2, and AWS KMS.
      2. The identity attempts to attach an encrypted EBS volume to an EC2 instance. This action fails 
         with an authorization error even though the user has permission to use all the relevant services.
      Step 2 fails because the request to AWS KMS to decrypt the volume's encrypted data key comes 
      from an IP address that is associated with the Amazon EC2 infrastructure. To succeed, the request 
      must come from the IP address of the originating user. Because the policy in step 1 explicitly denies 
      all requests from IP addresses other than those speciﬁed, Amazon EC2 is denied permission to 
      decrypt the EBS volume's encrypted data key.
      Also, the aws:SourceIP condition key is not eﬀective when the request comes from an Amazon 
      VPC endpoint. To restrict requests to a VPC endpoint, including an AWS KMS VPC endpoint, use the
      aws:SourceVpce or aws:SourceVpc condition keys. For more information, see VPC Endpoints - 
      Controlling the Use of Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
      Using VPC endpoint conditions in policies with AWS KMS permissions
      AWS KMS supports Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints that are powered by
      AWS PrivateLink. You can use the following global condition keys in key policies and IAM policies to 
      control access to AWS KMS resources when the request comes from a VPC or uses a VPC endpoint. 
      For details, see Use VPC endpoints to control access to AWS KMS resources.
      •
        aws:SourceVpc limits access to requests from the speciﬁed VPC.

        aws:SourceVpce limits access to requests from the speciﬁed VPC endpoint.

      If you use these condition keys to control access to KMS keys, you might inadvertently deny access 
      to AWS services that use AWS KMS on your behalf.
      Take care to avoid a situation like the IP address condition keys example. If you restrict requests for 
      a KMS key to a VPC or VPC endpoint, calls to AWS KMS from an integrated service, such as Amazon 
      S3 or Amazon EBS, might fail. This can happen even if the source request ultimately originates in 
      the VPC or from the VPC endpoint.
      Using IPv6 addresses in IAM and AWS KMS key policies
      Before trying to access AWS KMS over IPv6, ensure any key and IAM policies containing IP address 
      restrictions are updated to include IPv6 address ranges. IP based policies that are not updated to 
      handle IPv6 addresses may result in clients incorrectly losing or gaining access when they start 
      using IPv6. For general guidance on KMS access controls, see KMS key access and permissions. To 
      learn about KMS and dual stack support, see Dual-stack endpoint support.
           Important
           These statements do not allow any actions. Use these statements in combination with 
           other statements that allow speciﬁc actions.
      The following statement explicitly denies access to all KMS permissions for requests originating 
      from the 192.0.2.* range of IPv4 addresses. Any IP addresses outside of this range are not 
      explicitly denied KMS permissions. Since all IPv6 addresses are outside of the denied range, this 
      statement does not explicitly deny KMS permissions for any IPv6 addresses.

                    ] 
                } 
            }
        }
      AWS KMS condition keys
      AWS KMS provides a set of condition keys that you can use in key policies and IAM 
      policies. These condition keys are speciﬁc to AWS KMS. For example, you can use the
      kms:EncryptionContext:context-key condition key to require a particular encryption 
      context when controlling access to a symmetric encryption KMS key.
      Conditions for an API operation request
      Many AWS KMS condition keys control access to a KMS key based on the value of a parameter in 
      the request for an AWS KMS operation. For example, you can use the kms:KeySpec condition key 
      in an IAM policy to allow use of the CreateKey operation only when the value of the KeySpec
      parameter in the CreateKey request is RSA_4096.
      This type of condition works even when the parameter doesn't appear in the request, such as when 
      you use the parameter's default value. For example you can use the kms:KeySpec condition key 
      to allow users to use the CreateKey operation only when the value of the KeySpec parameter 
      is SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, which is the default value. This condition allows requests that have the
      AWS KMS condition keys                                                                  136
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
      KeySpec parameter with the SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT value and requests that have no KeySpec
      parameter.
      Conditions for KMS keys used in API operations
      Some AWS KMS condition keys can control access to operations based on a property of the 
      KMS key that is used in the operation. For example, you can use the kms:KeyOrigin condition to 
      allow principals to call GenerateDataKey on a KMS key only when the Origin of the KMS key is
      AWS_KMS. To ﬁnd out if a condition key can be used in this way, see the description of the condition 
      key.
      The operation must be a KMS key resource operation, that is, an operation that is authorized for 
      a particular KMS key. To identify the KMS key resource operations, in the Actions and Resources 
      Table, look for a value of KMS key in the Resources column for the operation. If you use this type 
      of condition key with an operation that is not authorized for a particular KMS key resource, like
      ListKeys, the permission is not eﬀective because the condition can never be satisﬁed. There is no 
      KMS key resource involved in authorizing the ListKeys operation and no KeySpec property.
      The following topics describe each AWS KMS condition key and include example policy statements 
      that demonstrate policy syntax.
      Using set operators with condition keys
      When a policy condition compares two set of values, such as the set of tags in a request and the 
      set of tags in a policy, you need tell AWS how to compare the sets. IAM deﬁnes two set operators,
      ForAnyValue and ForAllValues, for this purpose. Use set operators only with multi-valued 
      condition keys, which require them. Do not use set operators with single-valued condition keys. As 
      always, test your policy statements thoroughly before using them in a production environment.
      Condition keys are single-valued or multi-valued. To determine whether an AWS KMS condition key 
      is single-valued or multi-valued, see the Value type column in the condition key description.
      • Single-valued  condition keys have at most one value in the authorization context (the request 
        or resource). For example, because each API call can originate from only one AWS account,
        kms:CallerAccount is a single valued condition key. Do not use a set operator with a single-valued 
        condition key.
      • Multi-valued condition keys have multiple values in the authorization context (the request or 
        resource). For example, because each KMS key can have multiple aliases, kms:ResourceAliases can 
        have multiple values. Multi-valued condition keys require a set operator.
      AWS KMS condition keys                                                                137

      Note that the diﬀerence between single-valued and multi-valued condition keys depends on the 
      number of values in the authorization context; not the number of values in the policy condition.
           Warning
           Using a set operator with a single-valued condition key can create a policy statement 
           that is overly permissive (or overly restrictive). Use set operators only with multi-valued 
           condition keys.
           If you create or update a policy that includes a ForAllValues set operator with the 
           kms:EncryptionContext:context-key or aws:RequestTag/tag-key condition keys, AWS 
           KMS returns the following error message:
           OverlyPermissiveCondition: Using the ForAllValues set operator with 
           a single-valued condition key matches requests without the specified 
           [encryption context or tag] or with an unspecified [encryption 
           context or tag]. To fix, remove ForAllValues.
      For detailed information about the ForAnyValue and ForAllValues set operators, see Using 
      multiple keys and values in the IAM User Guide. For information about the risk of using the
      ForAllValues set operator with a single-valued condition, see Security Warning – ForAllValues 
      with single valued key in the IAM User Guide.

      The kms:BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck condition key controls access to the CreateKey
      and PutKeyPolicy operations based on the value of the BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck
      parameter in the request.
      The following example IAM policy statement prevents users from bypassing the policy 
      lockout safety check by denying them permission to create KMS keys when the value of the
      BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck parameter in the CreateKey request is true.
        { 
          "Effect": "Deny", 
          "Action": [ 
            "kms:CreateKey", 
            "kms:PutKeyPolicy" 
          ], 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Condition": { 
            "Bool": { 
               "kms:BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck": true
            } 
          }
        }
      You can also use the kms:BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck condition key in an IAM policy 
      or key policy to control access to the PutKeyPolicy operation. The following example policy 
      statement from a key policy prevents users from bypassing the policy lockout safety check when 
      changing the policy of a KMS key.
      Instead of using an explicit Deny, this policy statement uses Allow with the Null 
      condition operator to allow access only when the request does not include the
      BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck parameter. When the parameter is not used, the default 
      value is false. This slightly weaker policy statement can be overridden in the rare case that a 
      bypass is necessary.

      You can use this condition key to allow or deny access to all identities (users and roles) in an AWS 
      account. In key policies, you use the Principal element to specify the identities to which the 
      policy statement applies. The syntax for the Principal element does not provide a way to specify 
      all identities in an AWS account. But you can achieve this eﬀect by combining this condition key 
      with a Principal element that speciﬁes all AWS identities.
      You can use it to control access to any KMS key resource operation, that is, any AWS KMS operation 
      that uses a particular KMS key. To identify the KMS key resource operations, in the Actions and 
      Resources Table, look for a value of KMS key in the Resources column for the operation. It is also 
      valid for operations that manage custom key stores.
      For example, the following key policy statement demonstrates how to use the
      kms:CallerAccount condition key. This policy statement is in the key policy for the AWS 
      managed key for Amazon EBS. It combines a Principal element that speciﬁes all AWS identities 
      with the kms:CallerAccount condition key to eﬀectively allow access to all identities in AWS 
      account 111122223333. It contains an additional AWS KMS condition key (kms:ViaService) to 
      AWS KMS condition keys                                                                  141

      operations based on the encryption algorithm that is used in the operation. For the
      Encrypt, Decrypt, and ReEncrypt operations, it controls access based on the value of the
      EncryptionAlgorithm parameter in the request. For operations that generate data keys and data 
      key pairs, it controls access based on the encryption algorithm that is used to encrypt the data key.

      This condition key has no eﬀect on operations performed outside of AWS KMS, such as encrypting 
      with the public key in an asymmetric KMS key pair outside of AWS KMS.
      EncryptionAlgorithm parameter in a request
      To allow users to use only a particular encryption algorithm with a KMS key, use a policy statement 
      with a Deny eﬀect and a StringNotEquals condition operator. For example, the following 
      example key policy statement prohibits principals who can assume the ExampleRole role from 
      using this KMS key in the speciﬁed cryptographic operations unless the encryption algorithm in the 
      request is RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256, an asymmetric encryption algorithm used with RSA KMS keys.
      Unlike a policy statement that allows a user to use a particular encryption algorithm, a policy 
      statement with a double-negative like this one prevents other policies and grants for this KMS key 
      from allowing this role to use other encryption algorithms. The Deny in this key policy statement 
      takes precedence over any key policy or IAM policy with an Allow eﬀect, and it takes precedence 
      over all grants for this KMS key and its principals.

      might not be speciﬁed in a request because it's the default value.
      This feature lets you use the kms:EncryptionAlgorithm condition key to control access to 
      the operations that generate data keys and data key pairs. These operations use only symmetric 
      encryption KMS keys and the SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT algorithm.
      For example, this IAM policy limits its principals to symmetric encryption. It denies access 
      to any KMS key in the example account for cryptographic operations unless the encryption 
      algorithm speciﬁed in the request or used in the operation is SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT. 
      Including GenerateDataKey* adds GenerateDataKey, GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext,
      GenerateDataKeyPair, and GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext to the permissions. The condition 
      has no eﬀect on these operations because they always use a symmetric encryption algorithm.

      You can use the kms:EncryptionContext:context-key condition key to control access to a
      symmetric encryption KMS key based on the encryption context in a request for a cryptographic 
      operation. Use this condition key to evaluate both the key and the value in the encryption context 
      pair. To evaluate only the encryption context keys or require an encryption context regardless of 
      keys or values, use the kms:EncryptionContextKeys condition key.
      AWS KMS condition keys                                                                  147

           Note
           Condition key values must conform to the character rules for key policies and IAM policies. 
           Some characters that are valid in an encryption context are not valid in policies. You might 
           not be able to use this condition key to express all valid encryption context values. For 
           details about key policy document rules, see Key policy format. For details about IAM policy 
           document rules, see IAM name requirements in the IAM User Guide.
      You cannot specify an encryption context in a cryptographic operation with an asymmetric 
      KMS key or an HMAC KMS key. Asymmetric algorithms and MAC algorithms do not support an 
      encryption context.
      To use the kms:EncryptionContext:context-key condition key, replace the context-key
      placeholder with the encryption context key. Replace the context-value placeholder with the 
      encryption context value.
        "kms:EncryptionContext:context-key": "context-value"
      For example, the following condition key speciﬁes an encryption context in which the key is
      AppName and the value is ExampleApp (AppName = ExampleApp).
        "kms:EncryptionContext:AppName": "ExampleApp"
      This is a single-valued condition key. The key in the condition key speciﬁes a particular encryption 
      context key (context-key). Although you can include multiple encryption context pairs in each API 
      request, the encryption context pair with the speciﬁed context-key can have only one value. For 
      example, the kms:EncryptionContext:Department condition key applies only to encryption 
      context pairs with a Department key, and any given encryption context pair with the Department
      key can have only one value.
      Do not use a set operator with the kms:EncryptionContext:context-key condition key. If 
      you create a policy statement with an Allow action, the kms:EncryptionContext:context-
      key condition key, and the ForAllValues set operator, the condition allows requests with no 
      encryption context and requests with encryption context pairs that are not speciﬁed in the policy 
      condition.
      AWS KMS condition keys                                                                  148

           Warning
           Do not use a ForAnyValue or ForAllValues set operator with this single-valued 
           condition key. These set operators can create a policy condition that does not require 
           values you intend to require and allows values you intend to forbid.
           If you create or update a policy that includes a ForAllValues set operator with the 
           kms:EncryptionContext:context-key, AWS KMS returns the following error message:
           OverlyPermissiveCondition:EncryptionContext: Using the ForAllValues
           set operator with a single-valued condition key matches requests 
           without the specified encryption context or with an unspecified 
           encryption context. To fix, remove ForAllValues.
      To require a particular encryption context pair, use the kms:EncryptionContext:context-key
      condition key with the StringEquals operator .
      The following example key policy statement allows principals who can assume the role to use the 
      KMS key in a GenerateDataKey request only when the encryption context in the request includes 
      the AppName:ExampleApp pair. Other encryption context pairs are permitted.
      The key name is not case sensitive. The case sensitivity of the value is determined by the condition 
      operator, such as StringEquals. For details, see Case sensitivity of the encryption context 
      condition.

      The following key policy statement uses the kms:EncryptionContext:AppName condition 
      to require the AppName=ExampleApp encryption context pair in the request. It also uses a
      kms:EncryptionContextKeys condition key with the ForAllValues set operator to allow only 
      the AppName encryption context key.
      The ForAllValues set operator limits encryption context keys in the request to AppName. If the
      kms:EncryptionContextKeys condition with the ForAllValues set operator was used alone 
      in a policy statement, this set operator would allow requests with no encryption context. However, 
      if the request had no encryption context, the kms:EncryptionContext:AppName condition 
      would fail. For details about the ForAllValues set operator, see Using multiple keys and values in 
      the IAM User Guide.

          }
        }   
      You can also use this condition key to deny access to a KMS key for a particular operation. The 
      following example key policy statement uses a Deny eﬀect to forbid the principal from using 
      the KMS key if the encryption context in the request includes a Stage=Restricted encryption 
      context pair. This condition allows a request with other encryption context pairs, including 
      encryption context pairs with the Stage key and other values, such as Stage=Test.

            "StringEquals": { 
              "kms:EncryptionContext:Stage": "Restricted" 
            } 
          }
        }
      Using multiple encryption context pairs
      You can require or forbid multiple encryption context pairs. You can also require one of several 
      encryption context pairs. For details about the logic used to interpret these conditions, see Creating 
      a condition with multiple keys or values in the IAM User Guide.
           Note
           Earlier versions of this topic displayed policy statements that used the ForAnyValue and
           ForAllValues set operators with the kms:EncryptionContext:context-key condition key. 
           Using a set operator with a single-valued condition key can result in policies that allow 
           requests with no encryption context and unspeciﬁed encryption context pairs.
           For example, a policy condition with the Allow eﬀect, the ForAllValues set operator, 
           and the "kms:EncryptionContext:Department": "IT" condition key does not 
           limit the encryption context to the "Department=IT" pair. It allows requests with no 
           encryption context and requests with unspeciﬁed encryption context pairs, such as
           Stage=Restricted.
           Please review your policies and eliminate the set operator from any condition with 
           kms:EncryptionContext:context-key. Attempts to create or update a policy with this format 
           fail with an OverlyPermissiveCondition exception. To resolve the error, delete the set 
           operator.
      To require multiple encryption context pairs, list the pairs in the same condition. 
      The following example key policy statement requires two encryption context pairs,
      Department=IT and Project=Alpha. Because the conditions have diﬀerent keys 
      (kms:EncryptionContext:Department and kms:EncryptionContext:Project), they are 
      implicitly connected by an AND operator. Other encryption context pairs are permitted, but not 
      required.

          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/RoleForExampleApp"

               "kms:EncryptionContext:Project": "Alpha"
            } 
          }
        }
      To require one encryption context pair OR another pair, place each condition key in a separate 
      policy statement. The following example key policy requires Department=IT or Project=Alpha
      pairs, or both. Other encryption context pairs are permitted, but not required.
        { 
         "Effect": "Allow", 
         "Principal": { 
          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/RoleForExampleApp"

          } 
         }
        }
      To require particular encryption pairs and exclude all other encryption context pairs, use both 
      kms:EncryptionContext:context-key and kms:EncryptionContextKeys in the policy statement. 
      The following key policy statement uses the kms:EncryptionContext:context-key condition to 
      require an encryption context with both Department=IT and Project=Alpha pairs. It uses a
      kms:EncryptionContextKeys condition key with the ForAllValues set operator to allow only 
      the Department and Project encryption context keys.
      The ForAllValues set operator limits encryption context keys in the request to Department
      and Project. If it were used alone in a condition, this set operator would allow requests with 
      no encryption context, but in this conﬁguration, the kms:EncryptionContext:context-key in this 
      condition would fail.
        { 
          "Effect": "Allow", 
          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/RoleForExampleApp" 
          }, 
          "Action": "kms:GenerateDataKey", 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Condition": { 
            "StringEquals": { 
              "kms:EncryptionContext:Department": "IT", 
              "kms:EncryptionContext:Project": "Alpha" 
            }, 
            "ForAllValues:StringEquals": { 
              "kms:EncryptionContextKeys": [ 
                "Department", 
                "Project" 
              ] 
            } 
          }
        }   
      You can also forbid multiple encryption context pairs. The following example key policy statement 
      uses a Deny eﬀect to forbid the principal from using the KMS keys if the encryption context in the 
      request includes a Stage=Restricted or Stage=Production.pair.
      AWS KMS condition keys                                                                  153

      Multiple values (Restricted and Production) for the same key 
      (kms:EncryptionContext:Stage) are implicitly connected by a OR. For details, see Evaluation 
      logic for conditions with multiple keys or values in the IAM User Guide.
        { 
          "Effect": "Deny", 
          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/RoleForExampleApp" 
          }, 
          "Action": "kms:GenerateDataKey", 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Condition": { 
            "StringEquals": { 
              "kms:EncryptionContext:Stage": [ 
                 "Restricted", 
                 "Production" 
              ]  
            } 
          }
        }
      Case sensitivity of the encryption context condition
      The encryption context that is speciﬁed in a decryption operation must be an exact, case-sensitive 
      match for the encryption context that is speciﬁed in the encryption operation. Only the order of 
      pairs in an encryption context with multiple pair can vary.
      However, in policy conditions, the condition key is not case sensitive. The case sensitivity 
      of the condition value is determined by the policy condition operator that you use, such as
      StringEquals or StringEqualsIgnoreCase.
      As such, the condition key, which consists of the kms:EncryptionContext: preﬁx and the
      context-key replacement, is not case sensitive. A policy that uses this condition does not check 
      the case of either element of the condition key. The case sensitivity of the value, that is, the
      context-value replacement, is determined by the policy condition operator.
      For example, the following policy statement allows the operation when the encryption context 
      includes an Appname key, regardless of its capitalization. The StringEquals condition requires 
      that ExampleApp be capitalized as it is speciﬁed.

          }
        }
      To require a case-sensitive encryption context key, use the kms:EncryptionContextKeys policy 
      condition with a case-sensitive condition operator, such as StringEquals. In this policy condition, 
      because the encryption context key is the value in this policy condition, its case sensitivity is 
      determined by the condition operator.
        { 
          "Effect": "Allow", 
          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/RoleForExampleApp"

            } 
          }
        }
      To require a case-sensitive evaluation of both the encryption context key and value, use the
      kms:EncryptionContextKeys and kms:EncryptionContext:context-key policy conditions 
      together in the same policy statement. The case-sensitive condition operator (such as
      StringEquals) always applies to the value of the condition. The encryption context key (such as
      AppName) is the value of the kms:EncryptionContextKeys condition. The encryption context 
      value (such as ExampleApp) is the value of the kms:EncryptionContext:context-key condition.
      AWS KMS condition keys                                                                  155

      For example, in the following example key policy statement, because the StringEquals operator 
      is case sensitive, both the encryption context key and the encryption context value are case 
      sensitive.
        { 
          "Effect": "Allow",

            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/RoleForExampleApp"

          "Action": "kms:GenerateDataKey", 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Condition": { 
            "ForAnyValue:StringEquals": { 
              "kms:EncryptionContextKeys": "AppName" 
            }, 
            "StringEquals": { 
              "kms:EncryptionContext:AppName": "ExampleApp" 
            } 
          }
        }
      Using variables in an encryption context condition
      The key and value in an encryption context pair must be simple literal strings. They cannot be 
      integers or objects, or any type that is not fully resolved. If you use a diﬀerent type, such as an 
      integer or ﬂoat, AWS KMS interprets it as a literal string.
        "encryptionContext": { 
            "department": "10103.0"
        }
      However, the value of the kms:EncryptionContext:context-key condition key can be an IAM 
      policy variable. These policy variables are resolved at runtime based on values in the request. For 
      example, aws:CurrentTime resolves to the time of the request and aws:username resolves to 
      the friendly name of the caller.
      You can use these policy variables to create a policy statement with a condition that requires very 
      speciﬁc information in an encryption context, such as the caller's user name. Because it contains a 
      variable, you can use the same policy statement for all users who can assume the role. You don't 
      have to write a separate policy statement for each user.
      AWS KMS condition keys                                                                  156
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Consider a situation where you want to all users who can assume a role to use the same KMS key 
      to encrypt and decrypt their data. However, you want to allow them to decrypt only the data that 
      they encrypted. Start by requiring that every request to AWS KMS include an encryption context 
      where the key is user and the value is the caller's AWS user name, such as the following one.
        "encryptionContext": { 
            "user": "bob"
        }
      Then, to enforce this requirement, you can use a policy statement like the one in the following 
      example. This policy statement gives the TestTeam role permission to encrypt and decrypt data 
      with the KMS key. However, the permission is valid only when the encryption context in the request 
      includes a "user": "<username>" pair. To represent the user name, the condition uses the
      aws:username policy variable.
      When the request is evaluated, the caller's user name replaces the variable in the condition. As 
      such, the condition requires an encryption context of "user": "bob" for "bob" and "user": 
      "alice" for "alice."
        { 
          "Effect": "Allow", 
          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/TestTeam" 
          }, 
          "Action": [ 
            "kms:Decrypt", 
            "kms:Encrypt" 
          ], 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Condition": { 
            "StringEquals": { 
              "kms:EncryptionContext:user": "${aws:username}" 
            } 
          }
        }
      You can use an IAM policy variable only in the value of the kms:EncryptionContext:context-
      key condition key. You cannot use a variable in the key.
      You can also use provider-speciﬁc context keys in variables. These context keys uniquely identify 
      users who logged into AWS by using web identity federation.
      AWS KMS condition keys                                                                  157

      Like all variables, these variables can be used only in the kms:EncryptionContext:context-
      key policy condition, not in the actual encryption context. And they can be used only in the value 
      of the condition, not in the key.
      For example, the following key policy statement is similar to the previous one. However, the 
      condition requires an encryption context where the key is sub and the value uniquely identiﬁes 
      a user logged into an Amazon Cognito user pool. For details about identifying users and roles in 
      Amazon Cognito, see IAM Roles in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.

       You can use the kms:EncryptionContextKeys condition key to control access to a symmetric 
       encryption KMS key based on the encryption context in a request for a cryptographic operation. 
       Use this condition key to evaluate only the key in each encryption context pair. To evaluate both 
       the key and the value in the encryption context, use the kms:EncryptionContext:context-
       key condition key.
       You cannot specify an encryption context in a cryptographic operation with an asymmetric 
       KMS key or an HMAC KMS key. Asymmetric algorithms and MAC algorithms do not support an 
       encryption context.
            Note
            Condition key values, including an encryption context key, must conform to the character 
            and encoding rules for AWS KMS key policies. You might not be able to use this condition

           key to express all valid encryption context keys. For details about key policy document 
           rules, see Key policy format. For details about IAM policy document rules, see IAM name 
           requirements in the IAM User Guide.
      This is a multi-valued condition key. You can specify multiple encryption context pairs in each API 
      request. kms:EncryptionContextKeys compares the encryption context keys in the request to 
      the set of encryption context keys in the policy. To determine how these sets are compared, you 
      must provide a ForAnyValue or ForAllValues set operator in the policy condition. For details 
      about the set operators, see Using multiple keys and values in the IAM User Guide.
      •
        ForAnyValue: At least one encryption context key in the request must match an encryption 
        context key in the policy condition. Other encryption context keys are permitted. If the request 
        has no encryption context, the condition is not satisﬁed.
      •
        ForAllValues: Every encryption context key in the request must match an encryption context 
        key in the policy condition. This set operator limits the encryption context keys to those in 
        the policy condition. It doesn't require any encryption context keys, but it forbids unspeciﬁed 
        encryption context keys.
      The following example key policy statement uses the kms:EncryptionContextKeys condition 
      key with the ForAnyValue set operator. This policy statement allows use of a KMS key for the 
      speciﬁed operations, but only when at least one of the encryption context pairs in the request 
      includes the AppName key, regardless of its value.
      For example, this key policy statement allows a GenerateDataKey request with two encryption 
      context pairs, AppName=Helper and Project=Alpha, because the ﬁrst encryption context pair 
      satisﬁes the condition. A request with only Project=Alpha or with no encryption context would 
      fail.
      Because the StringEquals condition operation is case sensitive, this policy statement requires the 
      spelling and case of the encryption context key. But you can use a condition operator that ignores 
      the case of the key, such as StringEqualsIgnoreCase.

      key with the Null condition operator to allow access to a KMS key only when encryption context

       The kms:ExpirationModel condition key controls access to the ImportKeyMaterial operation 
       based on the value of the ExpirationModel parameter in the request.
       ExpirationModel is an optional parameter that determines whether the imported key material 
       expires. Valid values are KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES and KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE.
       KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES is the default value.
       The expiration date and time is determined by the value of the ValidTo parameter. The
       ValidTo parameter is required unless the value of the ExpirationModel parameter is
       KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE. You can also use the kms:ValidTo condition key to require a 
       particular expiration date as a condition for access.

       to allow users to import key material into a KMS key only when the request includes the

      key material only when the request does not have an ExpirationModel parameter. The default 
      value for ExpirationModel is KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES.

      When you create a grant, you can optionally specify a grant constraint to allow the operations that 
      the grant permit only when a particular encryption context is present. The grant constraint can be 
      one of two types: EncryptionContextEquals or EncryptionContextSubset. You can use this 
      condition key to check that the request contains one type or the other.

        Operations
       You can use this condition key to control access to the CreateGrant operation based on the
       grant operations in the request. For example, you can allow users to create grants that delegate 
       permission to encrypt but not decrypt. For more information about grants, see Using grants.
       This is a multi-valued condition key. kms:GrantOperations compares the set of grant operations 
       in the CreateGrant request to the set of grant operations in the policy. To determine how these 
       sets are compared, you must provide a ForAnyValue or ForAllValues set operator in the policy 
       condition. For details about the set operators, see Using multiple keys and values in the IAM User 
       Guide.
       •
         ForAnyValue: At least one grant operation in the request must match one of the grant 
         operations in the policy condition. Other grant operations are permitted.
       • ForAllValues: Every grant operation in the request must match a grant operation in the policy 
         condition. This set operator limits the grant operations to those speciﬁed in the policy condition. 
         It doesn't require any grant operations, but it forbids unspeciﬁed grant operations.
         ForAllValues also returns true when there are no grant operations in the request, but
         CreateGrant doesn't permit it. If the Operations parameter is missing or has a null value, the
         CreateGrant request fails.
       The following example key policy statement uses the kms:GrantOperations condition key to to 
       create grants only when the grant operations are Encrypt, ReEncryptTo, or both. If the grant 
       includes any other operations, the CreateGrant request fails.

              ] 
            } 
          }
        }
      If you change the set operator in the policy condition to ForAnyValue, the policy statement 
      would require that at least one of the grant operations in the grant is Encrypt or ReEncryptTo, 
      but it would allow other grant operations, such as Decrypt or ReEncryptFrom.

      key only when the grantee principal in the CreateGrant request matches the principal speciﬁed 
      in the condition statement.

      To specify the grantee principal, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS principal. Valid 
      principals include AWS accounts, IAM users, IAM roles, federated users, and assumed role users. For 
      help with the ARN syntax for a principal, see IAM ARNs in the IAM User Guide.

      key to to create grants for a KMS key only when the grantee principal in the grant is the
      LimitedAdminRole.

      The kms:KeyOrigin condition key controls access to operations based on the value of the
      Origin property of the KMS key that is created by or used in the operation. It works as a resource 
      condition or a request condition.
      You can use this condition key to control access to the CreateKey operation based on the value of 
      the Origin parameter in the request. Valid values for Origin are AWS_KMS, AWS_CLOUDHSM, and
      EXTERNAL.
      For example, you can to create a KMS key only when the key material is generated in AWS KMS 
      (AWS_KMS), only when the key material is generated in an AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated 
      with a custom key store (AWS_CLOUDHSM), or only when the key material is imported from an 
      external source (EXTERNAL).
      The following example key policy statement uses the kms:KeyOrigin condition key to to create a 
      KMS key only when AWS KMS creates the key material.

      You can also use the kms:KeyOrigin condition key to control access to operations that use or 
      manage a KMS key based on the Origin property of the KMS key used for the operation. The 
      operation must be a KMS key resource operation, that is, an operation that is authorized for a 
      particular KMS key. To identify the KMS key resource operations, in the Actions and Resources

      The kms:KeySpec condition key controls access to operations based on the value of the KeySpec
      property of the KMS key that is created by or used in the operation.
      You can use this condition key in an IAM policy to control access to the CreateKey operation based 
      on the value of the KeySpec parameter in a CreateKey request. For example, you can use this 
      condition to allow users to create only symmetric encryption KMS keys or only HMAC KMS keys.
      The following example IAM policy statement uses the kms:KeySpec condition key to allow the 
      principals to create only RSA asymmetric KMS keys. The permission is valid only when the KeySpec
      in the request begins with RSA_.

      You can also use the kms:KeySpec condition key to control access to operations that use or 
      manage a KMS key based on the KeySpec property of the KMS key used for the operation. The 
      operation must be a KMS key resource operation, that is, an operation that is authorized for a 
      particular KMS key. To identify the KMS key resource operations, in the Actions and Resources 
      Table, look for a value of KMS key in the Resources column for the operation.
      For example, the following IAM policy allows principals to perform the speciﬁed KMS key resource

       The kms:KeyUsage condition key controls access to operations based on the value of the
       KeyUsage property of the KMS key that is created by or used in the operation.
       You can use this condition key to control access to the CreateKey operation based on the value 
       of the KeyUsage parameter in the request. Valid values for KeyUsage are ENCRYPT_DECRYPT,
       SIGN_VERIFY, GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC, and KEY_AGREEMENT.
       For example, you can to create a KMS key only when the KeyUsage is ENCRYPT_DECRYPT or deny 
       a user permission when the KeyUsage is SIGN_VERIFY.
       The following example IAM policy statement uses the kms:KeyUsage condition key to to create a 
       KMS key only when the KeyUsage is ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.
        { 
          "Effect": "Allow",   
          "Action": "kms:CreateKey",

      You can use the kms:MacAlgorithm condition key to control access to the GenerateMac and
      VerifyMac operations based on the value of the MacAlgorithm parameter in the request.
      The following example key policy allows users who can assume the testers role to use the 
      HMAC KMS key to generate and verify HMAC tags only when the MAC algorithm in the request is
      HMAC_SHA_384 or HMAC_SHA_512. This policy uses two separate policy statements each with its 
      own condition. If you specify more than one MAC algorithm in a single condition statement, the 
      condition requires both algorithms, instead of one or the other.

       You can use this condition key to allow operations only on single-Region keys or only on multi-
       Region keys. The kms:MultiRegion condition key controls access to AWS KMS operations on 
       KMS keys and to the CreateKey operation based on the value of the MultiRegion property of 
       the KMS key. Valid values are true (multi-Region), and false (single-Region). All KMS keys have a

       For example, the following IAM policy statement uses the kms:MultiRegion condition key to 
       allow principals to create only single-Region keys.

       You can use this condition key to allow operations only on multi-Region primary keys or only on
       multi-Region replica keys. The kms:MultiRegionKeyType condition key controls access to AWS 
       KMS operations on KMS keys and the CreateKey operation based on the MultiRegionKeyType
       property of the KMS key. The valid values are PRIMARY and REPLICA. Only multi-Region keys have 
       a MultiRegionKeyType property.
       Typically, you use the kms:MultiRegionKeyType condition key in an IAM policy to control access 
       to multiple KMS keys. However, because a given multi-Region key can change to primary or replica, 
       you might want to use this condition in a key policy to allow an operation only when the particular 
       multi-Region key is a primary or replica key.
       For example, the following IAM policy statement uses the kms:MultiRegionKeyType condition 
       key to allow principals to schedule and cancel key deletion only on multi-Region replica keys in the 
       speciﬁed AWS account.
        {

      To allow or deny access to all multi-Region keys, you can use both values or a null value with
      kms:MultiRegionKeyType. However, the kms:MultiRegion condition key is recommended for 
      that purpose.

      You can use this condition key to limit the destination Regions in an UpdatePrimaryRegion
      operation. These are AWS Regions that can host your multi-Region primary keys.
      The kms:PrimaryRegion condition key controls access to the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation 
      based on the value of the PrimaryRegion parameter. The PrimaryRegion parameter speciﬁes 
      the AWS Region of the multi-Region replica key that is being promoted to primary. The value of 
      the condition is one or more AWS Region names, such as us-east-1 or ap-southeast-2, or 
      Region name patterns, such as eu-*
      For example, the following key policy statement uses the kms:PrimaryRegion condition key to 
      allow principals to update the primary region of a multi-Region key to one of the four speciﬁed 
      Regions.

      You can use this condition key to control access to the ReEncrypt operation based on whether the 
      request speciﬁes a destination KMS key that is the same one used for the original encryption.
      For example, the following key policy statement uses the kms:ReEncryptOnSameKey condition

       You can use this condition key to allow an operation only when the request uses a particular alias 
       to identify the KMS key. The kms:RequestAlias condition key controls access to a KMS key used 
       in a cryptographic operation, GetPublicKey, or DescribeKey based on the alias that identiﬁes 
       that KMS key in the request. (This policy condition has no eﬀect on the GenerateRandom operation 
       because the operation doesn't use a KMS key or alias.)
       This condition supports attribute-based access control (ABAC) in AWS KMS, which lets you control 
       access to KMS keys based on the tags and aliases of a KMS key. You can use tags and aliases to 
       allow or deny access to a KMS key without changing policies or grants. For details, see ABAC for 
       AWS KMS.
       To specify the alias in this policy condition, use an alias name, such as alias/project-alpha, or 
       an alias name pattern, such as alias/*test*. You cannot specify an alias ARN in the value of this 
       condition key.
       To satisfy this condition, the value of the KeyId parameter in the request must be a matching alias 
       name or alias ARN. If the request uses a diﬀerent key identiﬁer, it does not satisfy the condition, 
       even if identiﬁes the same KMS key.
       For example, the following key policy statement allows the principal to call the GenerateDataKey
       operation on the KMS key. However this is permitted only when the value of the KeyId
       parameter in the request is alias/finance-key or an alias ARN with that alias name, such as
       arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/finance-key.

      Use this condition key to control access to a KMS key based on the aliases that are associated with 
      the KMS key. The operation must be a KMS key resource operation, that is, an operation that is 
      authorized for a particular KMS key. To identify the KMS key resource operations, in the Actions 
      and Resources Table, look for a value of KMS key in the Resources column for the operation.
      This condition supports attribute-based access control (ABAC) in AWS KMS. With ABAC, you can 
      control access to KMS keys based on the tags that are assigned to a KMS key and the aliases that 
      are associated with a KMS key. You can use tags and aliases to allow or deny access to a KMS key 
      without changing policies or grants. For details, see ABAC for AWS KMS.
      An alias must be unique in an AWS account and Region, but this condition lets you control access to 
      multiple KMS keys in the same Region (using the StringLike comparison operator) or to multiple 
      KMS keys in diﬀerent AWS Regions of each account.

           Note
           The kms:ResourceAliases condition is eﬀective only when the KMS key conforms to the
           aliases per KMS key quota. If a KMS key exceeds this quota, principals who are authorized 
           to use the KMS key by the kms:ResourceAliases condition are denied access to the KMS 
           key.
      To specify the alias in this policy condition, use an alias name, such as alias/project-alpha, or 
      an alias name pattern, such as alias/*test*. You cannot specify an alias ARN in the value of this 
      condition key. To satisfy the condition, the KMS key used in the operation must have the speciﬁed 
      alias. It does not matter whether or how the KMS key is identiﬁed in the request for the operation.
      This is a multivalued condition key that compares the set of aliases associated with a KMS key to 
      the set of aliases in the policy. To determine how these sets are compared, you must provide a
      ForAnyValue or ForAllValues set operator in the policy condition. For details about the set 
      operators, see Using multiple keys and values in the IAM User Guide.
      • ForAnyValue: At least one alias associated with the KMS key must match an alias in the policy 
        condition. Other aliases are permitted. If the KMS key has no aliases, the condition is not 
        satisﬁed.
      • ForAllValues: Every alias associated with the KMS key must match an alias in the policy. This set 
        operator limits the aliases associated with the KMS key to those in the policy condition. It doesn't 
        require any aliases, but it forbids unspeciﬁed aliases.
      For example, the following IAM policy statement allows the principal to call the GenerateDataKey
      operation on any KMS key in the speciﬁed AWS account that is associated with the finance-
      key alias. (The key policies of the aﬀected KMS keys must also allow the principal's account to 
      use them for this operation.) To indicate that the condition is satisﬁed when one of the many 
      aliases that might be associated with the KMS key is alias/finance-key, the condition uses the
      ForAnyValue set operator.
      Because the kms:ResourceAliases condition is based on the resource, not the request, a call to
      GenerateDataKey succeeds for any KMS key associated with the finance-key alias, even if the 
      request uses a key ID or key ARN to identify the KMS key.

      with the KMS key include "Test". The condition with the ForAnyValue set operator requires that 
      the KMS key have at least one alias with "Test." Without the ForAnyValue condition, this policy

       You can use this condition key to limit the AWS Regions in which a principal can replicate a multi-
       Region key. The kms:ReplicaRegion condition key controls access to the ReplicateKey operation 
       based on the value of the ReplicaRegion parameter in the request. This parameter speciﬁes the 
       AWS Region for the new replica key.
       The value of the condition is one or more AWS Region names, such as us-east-1 or ap-
       southeast-2, or name patterns, such as eu-*. For a list of the names of AWS Regions that 
       AWS KMS supports, see AWS Key Management Service endpoints and quotas in the AWS General 
       Reference.
       For example, the following key policy statement uses the kms:ReplicaRegion condition key to

      You can use this condition key to control access to the CreateGrant operation based on the value 
      of the RetiringPrincipal parameter in the request. For example, you can to create grants to use 
      a KMS key only when the RetiringPrincipal in the CreateGrant request matches the
      RetiringPrincipal in the condition statement.
      To specify the retiring principal, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS principal. Valid 
      principals include AWS accounts, IAM users, IAM roles, federated users, and assumed role users. For 
      help with the ARN syntax for a principal, see IAM ARNs in the IAM User Guide.
      The following example key policy statement allows a user to create grants for the KMS key. The

      You can use this condition key to limit the values that principals can specify in the
      RotationPeriodInDays parameter of a EnableKeyRotation request.
      The RotationPeriodInDays speciﬁes the number of days between each automatic key rotation 
      date. AWS KMS allows you to specify a rotation period between 90 and 2560 days, but you can use 
      the kms:RotationPeriodInDays condition key to further constrain the rotation period, such as 
      enforcing a minimum rotation period within the valid range.
      For example, the following key policy statement uses the kms:RotationPeriodInDays condition 
      key to prevent principals from enabling key rotation if the rotation period is less than or equal to 
      180 days.

      You can use this condition key to limit the values that principals can specify in the
      PendingWindowInDays parameter of a ScheduleKeyDeletion request.
      The PendingWindowInDays speciﬁes the number of days that AWS KMS will wait before deleting 
      a key. AWS KMS allows you to specify a waiting period between 7 and 30 days, but you can use 
      the kms:ScheduleKeyDeletionPendingWindowInDays condition key to further constrain the 
      waiting period, such as enforcing a minimum waiting period within the valid range.
      For example, the following key policy statement uses the
      kms:ScheduleKeyDeletionPendingWindowInDays condition key to prevent principals from 
      scheduling key deletion if the waiting period is less than or equal to 21 days.

       You can use the kms:SigningAlgorithm condition key to control access to the Sign and Verify
       operations based on the value of the SigningAlgorithm parameter in the request. This condition 
       key has no eﬀect on operations performed outside of AWS KMS, such as verifying signatures with 
       the public key in an asymmetric KMS key pair outside of AWS KMS.
       The following example key policy allows users who can assume the testers role to use the KMS 
       key to sign messages only when the signing algorithm used for the request is an RSASSA_PSS 
       algorithm, such as RSASSA_PSS_SHA512.

                                                              Material
       The kms:ValidTo condition key controls access to the ImportKeyMaterial operation based on the 
       value of the ValidTo parameter in the request, which determines when the imported key material 
       expires. The value is expressed in Unix time.
       By default, the ValidTo parameter is required in an ImportKeyMaterial request. However, if 
       the value of the ExpirationModel parameter is KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE, the ValidTo
       parameter is invalid. You can also use the kms:ExpirationModel condition key to require the
       ExpirationModel parameter or a speciﬁc parameter value.
       The following example policy statement allows a user to import key material into a KMS key. The
       kms:ValidTo condition key limits the permission to ImportKeyMaterial requests where the
       ValidTo value is less than or equal to 1546257599.0 (December 31, 2018 11:59:59 PM).

                                                              operations
      The kms:ViaService condition key limits use of an KMS key to requests from speciﬁed AWS 
      services. This condition key only applies for Forward access sessions. You can specify one or more 
      services in each kms:ViaService condition key. The operation must be a KMS key resource 
      operation, that is, an operation that is authorized for a particular KMS key. To identify the KMS 
      key resource operations, in the Actions and Resources Table, look for a value of KMS key in the
      Resources column for the operation.
      For example, the following key policy statement uses the kms:ViaService condition key to allow 
      a customer managed key to be used for the speciﬁed actions only when the request comes from 
      Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS in the US West (Oregon) region on behalf of ExampleRole.

              ] 
            } 
          }
        }
      You can also use a kms:ViaService condition key to deny permission to use a KMS key when the 
      request comes from particular services. For example, the following policy statement from a key 
      policy uses a kms:ViaService condition key to prevent a customer managed key from being used 
      for Encrypt operations when the request comes from AWS Lambda on behalf of ExampleRole.
        { 
          "Effect": "Deny", 
          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/ExampleRole" 
          }, 
          "Action": [ 
            "kms:Encrypt"     
          ], 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Condition": { 
            "StringEquals": { 
               "kms:ViaService": [ 
                   "lambda.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
              ] 
            } 
          }
        }
           Important
           When you use the kms:ViaService condition key, the service makes the request on 
           behalf of a principal in the AWS account. These principals must have the following 
           permissions:
           • Permission to use the KMS key. The principal needs to grant these permissions to the 
             integrated service so the service can use the customer managed key on behalf of the 
             principal. For more information, see Using AWS KMS encryption with AWS services.
      AWS KMS condition keys                                                                  193

           • Permission to use the integrated service. For details about giving users access to an AWS 
             service that integrates with AWS KMS, consult the documentation for the integrated 
             service.
      All AWS managed keys use a kms:ViaService condition key in their key policy document. This 
      condition allows the KMS key to be used only for requests that come from the service that created 
      the KMS key. To see the key policy for an AWS managed key, use the GetKeyPolicy operation.
      The kms:ViaService condition key is valid in IAM and key policy statements. The services that 
      you specify must be integrated with AWS KMS and support the kms:ViaService condition key.
      Services that support the kms:ViaService condition key
      The following table lists AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS and support the use of 
      the kms:ViaService condition key in customer managed keys The services in this table might not 
      be available in all regions. Use the .amazonaws.com suﬃx of the AWS KMS ViaService name in all 
      AWS partitions.

      The following example key policy statement uses the kms:WrappingAlgorithm condition key to 
      give the example user permission to call the GetParametersForImport operation, but prevents 
      them from using the RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1 wrapping algorithm. When the WrappingAlgorithm in 
      the GetParametersForImport request is RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1, the operation fails.

      AWS KMS condition keys for AWS Nitro Enclaves
      AWS Nitro Enclaves is an Amazon EC2 capability that lets you create isolated compute 
      environments called enclaves to protect and process highly sensitive data. AWS KMS provides 
      condition keys to support AWS Nitro Enclaves. These conditions keys are eﬀective only for requests 
      to AWS KMS for a Nitro Enclave.
      When you call the Decrypt, DeriveSharedSecret, GenerateDataKey, GenerateDataKeyPair, or
      GenerateRandom API operations with the signed attestation document from an enclave, these APIs 
      encrypt the plaintext in the response under the public key from the attestation document, and 
      return ciphertext instead of plaintext. This ciphertext can be decrypted only by using the private 
      key in the enclave. For more information, see Cryptographic attestation for AWS Nitro Enclaves.
           Note
           If you don't provide a key policy when you create an AWS KMS key, AWS creates one for 
           you. This default key policy grants the AWS accounts that own the KMS key full access to 
           the key and allows the account to use IAM policies to allow access to the key. This policy 
           allows all actions like Decrypt. AWS recommends applying principal of Least-privilege

           permissions to your KMS key policies. You can also restrict access by modifying the KMS key 
           policy action for kms:* to NotAction:kms:Decrypt.
      The following condition keys let you limit the permissions for these operations based on the 
      contents of the signed attestation document. Before allowing an operation, AWS KMS compares 
      the attestation document from the enclave to the values in these AWS KMS condition keys.

      The kms:RecipientAttestation:ImageSha384 condition key controls access to Decrypt,
      DeriveSharedSecret, GenerateDataKey, GenerateDataKeyPair, and GenerateRandom
      with a KMS key when the image digest from the signed attestation document in the request 
      matches the value in the condition key. The ImageSha384 value corresponds to PCR0 in the 
      attestation document. This condition key is eﬀective only when the Recipient parameter in the 
      request speciﬁes a signed attestation document for an AWS Nitro enclave.
      This value is also included in CloudTrail events for requests to AWS KMS for Nitro enclaves.
      For example, the following key policy statement allows the data-processing role to use 
      the KMS key for Decrypt, DeriveSharedSecret, GenerateDataKey, GenerateDataKeyPair, and

      GenerateRandom operations. The kms:RecipientAttestation:ImageSha384 condition key 
      allows the operations only when the image digest value (PCR0) of the attestation document in the 
      request matches the image digest value in the condition. This condition key is eﬀective only when 
      the Recipient parameter in the request speciﬁes a signed attestation document for an AWS Nitro 
      enclave.
      If the request does not include a valid attestation document from an AWS Nitro enclave, 
      permission is denied because this condition is not satisﬁed.

      The kms:RecipientAttestation:PCR<PCR_ID> condition key controls access to Decrypt,
      DeriveSharedSecret, GenerateDataKey, GenerateDataKeyPair, and GenerateRandom
      with a KMS key only when the platform conﬁguration registers (PCRs) from the signed attestation 
      document in the request match the PCRs in the condition key. This condition key is eﬀective only 
      when the Recipient parameter in the request speciﬁes a signed attestation document from an 
      AWS Nitro enclave.
      This value is also included in CloudTrail events that represent requests to AWS KMS for Nitro 
      enclaves.
      To specify a PCR value, use the following format. Concatenate the PCR ID to the condition key 
      name. You can specify a PCR ID that identiﬁes one of the six enclave measurements or a custom 
      PCR ID that you deﬁned for a speciﬁc use case. The PCR value must be a lower-case hexadecimal 
      string of up to 96 bytes.
        "kms:RecipientAttestation:PCRPCR_ID": "PCR_value"
      For example, the following condition key speciﬁes a particular value for PCR1, which corresponds 
      to the hash of the kernel used for the enclave and the bootstrap process.
        kms:RecipientAttestation:PCR1: 
         "0x1abcdef2abcdef3abcdef4abcdef5abcdef6abcdef7abcdef8abcdef9abcdef8abcdef7abcdef6abcdef5abcdef4abcdef3abcdef2abcdef1abcdef0abcde"
      The following example key policy statement allows the data-processing role to use the KMS 
      key for the Decrypt operation.

      kms:RecipientAttestation:PCR1 value in the condition. Use the StringEqualsIgnoreCase
      policy operator to require a case-insensitive comparison of the PCR values.
      If the request does not include an attestation document, permission is denied because this

      Least-privilege permissions
      Since your KMS keys protect sensitive information, we recommend following the principle of least-
      privileged access. Delegate the minimum permissions required to perform a task when you deﬁne 
      your key policies. Only allow all actions (kms:*) on a KMS key policy if you plan to further restrict 
      permissions with additional IAM policies. If you plan to manage permissions with IAM policies, 
      limit who has the ability to create and attach IAM policies to IAM principals and monitor for policy 
      changes.
      If you allow all actions (kms:*) in both the key policy and the IAM policy, the principal has both 
      administrative and usage permissions to the KMS key. As a security best practice, we recommend 
      only delegating these permissions to speciﬁc principals. You can do this by explicitly naming the 
      principal in the key policy or by limiting which principals the IAM policy is attached to. You can also 
      use condition keys to restrict permissions. For example, you can use the aws:PrincipalTag to 
      allow all actions if the principal making the API call has the tag speciﬁed in the condition rule.

      For help understanding how policy statements are evaluated in AWS, see Policy evaluation logic
      in the IAM User Guide. We recommend reviewing this topic before writing policies to reduce the 
      chance that your policy has unintended eﬀects, such as providing access to principals that should 
      not have access.
           Tip
           When testing an application in a non-production envrionment, use IAM Access Analyzer to 
           help you apply least-privileges to your IAM policies.
      If you use IAM users instead of IAM roles, we strongly recommend enabling AWS multi-factor 
      authentication (MFA) to mitigate the vulnerability of long-term credentials. You can use MFA to do 
      the following:
      • Require that users validate their credentials with MFA before performing privileged actions, such 
        as scheduling key deletion.
      • Split ownership of an administrator account password and MFA device between individuals to 
        implement split authorization.

      Implementing least privileged permissions
      When you give an AWS service permission to use a KMS key, ensure that the permission is valid 
      only for the resources that the service must access on your behalf. This least privilege strategy 
      helps to prevent unauthorized use of a KMS key when requests are passed between AWS services.
      To implement a least privilege strategy, use we recommend using AWS KMS encryption context 
      condition keys and the global source ARN or source account condition keys.
      Using encryption context condition keys
      The most eﬀective way to implement least privileged permissions when using AWS KMS resources 
      is to include the kms:EncryptionContext:context-key or kms:EncryptionContextKeys condition keys 
      Implementing least privileged permissions                                               208
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      in the policy that allows principals to call AWS KMS cryptographic operations. These condition keys 
      are particularly eﬀective because they associate the permission with the encryption context that is 
      bound to the ciphertext when the resource is encrypted.
      Use encryption context conditions keys only when the action in the policy statement is CreateGrant
      or an AWS KMS symmetric cryptographic operation that takes an EncryptionContext
      parameter, such as the operations like GenerateDataKey or Decrypt. (For a list of supported 
      operations, see kms:EncryptionContext:context-key or kms:EncryptionContextKeys.) If you use 
      these condition keys to allow other operations, such as DescribeKey, permission will be denied.
      Set the value to the encryption context that the service uses when it encrypts the resource. 
      This information is typically available in the Security chapter of the service documentation. For 
      example, the encryption context for AWS Proton identiﬁes the AWS Proton resource and its 
      associated template. The AWS Secrets Manager encryption context identiﬁes the secret and its 
      version. The encryption context for Amazon Location identiﬁes the tracker or collection.
      The following example key policy statement allows Amazon Location Service to create grants on 
      behalf of authorized users. This policy statement limits the permission by using the kms:ViaService,
      kms:CallerAccount, and kms:EncryptionContext:context-key condition keys to tie the 
      permission to a particular tracker resource.

          "Sid": "Allow Amazon Location to create grants on behalf of authorized users",

      Using aws:SourceArn or aws:SourceAccount condition keys
      When the principal in a key policy statement is an AWS service principal, we strongly recommend 
      that you use the aws:SourceArn or aws:SourceAccount global condition keys, in addition to the
      kms:EncryptionContext:context-key condition key. The ARN and account values are 
      included in the authorization context only when a request comes to AWS KMS from another AWS 
      service. This combination of conditions implements least privileged permissions and avoids a 
      potential confused deputy scenario. Service principals are not typically used as principals in a key 
      policy, but some AWS services, such as AWS CloudTrail, require it.
      To use the aws:SourceArn or aws:SourceAccount global condition keys, set the value to the 
      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or account of the resource that is being encrypted. For example, 
      in a key policy statement that gives AWS CloudTrail permission to encrypt a trail, set the value of
      aws:SourceArn to the ARN of the trail. Whenever possible, use aws:SourceArn, which is more 
      speciﬁc. Set the value to the ARN or an ARN pattern with wildcard characters. If you don't know the 
      ARN of the resource, use aws:SourceAccount instead.
           Note
           If a resource ARN includes characters that are not permitted in an AWS KMS key policy, you 
           cannot use that resource ARN in the value of the aws:SourceArn condition key. Instead, 
           use the aws:SourceAccount condition key. For details about key policy document rules, 
           see Key policy format.
      In the following example key policy, the principal who gets the permissions is the AWS CloudTrail 
      service principal, cloudtrail.amazonaws.com. To implement least privilege, this policy uses 
      the aws:SourceArn and kms:EncryptionContext:context-key condition keys. The policy 
      statement allows CloudTrail to use the KMS key to generate the data key that it uses to encrypt 
      a trail. The aws:SourceArn and kms:EncryptionContext:context-key conditions are 
      evaluated independently. Any request to use the KMS key for the speciﬁed operation must satisfy 
      both conditions.
      To restrict the service's permission to the finance trail in the example account (111122223333) 
      and us-west-2 Region, this policy statement sets the aws:SourceArn condition key to the 
      ARN of a particular trail. The condition statement uses the ArnEquals operator to ensure that 
      every element in the ARN is evaluated independently when matching. The example also uses the

      ABAC for AWS KMS
      Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that deﬁnes permissions 
      based on attributes. AWS KMS supports ABAC by allowing you to control access to your customer 
      managed keys based on the tags and aliases associated with the KMS keys. The tag and alias 
      condition keys that enable ABAC in AWS KMS provide a powerful and ﬂexible way to authorize 
      principals to use KMS keys without editing policies or managing grants. But you should use these 
      feature with care so principals aren't inadvertently allowed or denied access.
      Attribute-based access control (ABAC)                                                   211
       AWS Key Management Service                                                                Developer Guide
       If you use ABAC, be aware that permission to manage tags and aliases is now an access control 
       permission. Be sure that you know the existing tags and aliases on all KMS keys before you deploy 
       a policy that depends on tags or aliases. Take reasonable precautions when adding, deleting, and 
       updating aliases, and when tagging and untagging keys. Give permissions to manage tags and 
       aliases only to principals who need them, and limit the tags and aliases they can manage.
             Notes
             When using ABAC for AWS KMS, be cautious about giving principals permission to manage 
             tags and aliases. Changing a tag or alias might allow or deny permission to a KMS key. 
             Key administrators who don't have permission to change key policies or create grants can 
             control access to KMS keys if they have permission to manage tags or aliases.
             It might take up to ﬁve minutes for tag and alias changes to aﬀect KMS key authorization. 
             Recent changes might be visible in API operations before they aﬀect authorization.
             To control access to a KMS key based on its alias, you must use a condition key. You cannot 
             use an alias to represent a KMS key in the Resource element of a policy statement. When 
             an alias appears in the Resource element, the policy statement applies to the alias, not to 
             the associated KMS key.

        A KMS key resource operation is an operation authorized for a particular KMS key. To identify the 
       KMS key resource operations, in the AWS KMS permissions table, look for a value of KMS key in the
       Resources column for the operation.
       For example, you can use these condition keys to create the following policies.
       •

          particular alias or alias pattern. This is a bit diﬀerent from policies that rely on tags: Although

        you can use alias patterns in a policy, each alias must be unique in an AWS account and Region. 
        This allows you to apply a policy to a select set of KMS keys without listing the key ARNs of the 
        KMS keys in the policy statement. To add or remove KMS keys from the set, change the alias of 
        the KMS key.
      •
        A key policy with kms:RequestAlias that allows principals to use a KMS key in a Encrypt
        operation, but only when the Encrypt request uses that alias to identify the KMS key.
      •
        An IAM policy with aws:ResourceTag/tag-key that denies permission to use KMS keys with a 
        particular tag key and tag value. This lets you apply a policy to a select set of KMS keys without 
        listing the key ARNs of the KMS keys in the policy statement. To add or remove KMS keys from 
        the set, tag or untag the KMS key.
      •
        An IAM policy with aws:RequestTag/tag-key that allows principals to delete only
        "Purpose"="Test" KMS key tags.
      •
        An IAM policy with aws:TagKeys that denies permission to tag or untag a KMS key with a
        Restricted tag key.
      ABAC makes access management ﬂexible and scalable. For example, you can use the
      aws:ResourceTag/tag-key condition key to create an IAM policy that allows principals to use 
      a KMS key for speciﬁed operations only when the KMS key has a Purpose=Test tag. The policy 
      applies to all KMS keys in all Regions of the AWS account.
      When attached to a user or role, the following IAM policy allows principals to use all existing KMS 
      keys with a Purpose=Test tag for the speciﬁed operations. To provide this access to new or 
      existing KMS keys, you don't need to change the policy. Just attach the Purpose=Test tag to the 
      KMS keys. Similarly, to remove this access from KMS keys with a Purpose=Test tag, edit or delete 
      the tag.

      However, if you use this feature, be careful when managing tags and aliases. Adding, changing, or 
      deleting a tag or alias can inadvertently allow or deny access to a KMS key. Key administrators who 
      don't have permission to change key policies or create grants can control access to KMS keys if they 
      have permission to manage tags and aliases. To mitigate this risk, consider limiting permissions to 
      manage tags and aliases. For example, you might want to allow only select principals to manage
      Purpose=Test tags. For details, see Use aliases to control access to KMS keys and Use tags to 
      control access to KMS keys.
      Tags or aliases?
      AWS KMS supports ABAC with tags and aliases. Both options provide a ﬂexible, scalable access 
      control strategy, but they're slightly diﬀerent from each other.
      You might decide to use tags or use aliases based on your particular AWS use patterns. For 
      example, if you have already given tagging permissions to most administrators, it might be easier 
      to control an authorization strategy based on aliases. Or, if you are close to the quota for aliases 
      per KMS key, you might prefer an authorization strategy based on tags.
      The following beneﬁts are of general interest.
      Beneﬁts of tag-based access control
      • Same authorization mechanism for diﬀerent types of AWS resources.
        You can use the same tag or tag key to control access to multiple resource types, such as an 
        Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) cluster, an Amazon Elastic Block Store 
        (Amazon EBS) volume, and a KMS key. This feature enables several diﬀerent authorization 
        models that are more ﬂexible than traditional role-based access control.
      • Authorize access to a group of KMS keys.

        You can use tags to manage access to a group of KMS keys in the same AWS account and Region. 
        Assign the same tag or tag key to the KMS keys that you choose. Then create a simple, easy-to-
        maintain policy statement that is based on the tag or tag key. To add or remove a KMS key from 
        your authorization group, add or remove the tag; you don't need to edit the policy.
      Beneﬁts of alias-based access control
      • Authorize access to cryptographic operations based on aliases.
        Most request-based policy conditions for attributes, including aws:RequestTag/tag-key, aﬀect 
        only operations that add, edit, or delete the attribute. But the kms:RequestAlias condition key 
        controls access to cryptographic operations based on the alias used to identify the KMS key in 
        the request. For example, you can give a principal permission to use a KMS key in a Encrypt
        operation but only when the value of the KeyId parameter is alias/restricted-key-1. To 
        satisfy this condition requires all of the following:
        • The KMS key must be associated with that alias.
        • The request must use the alias to identify the KMS key.
        •
          The principal must have permission to use the KMS key subject to the kms:RequestAlias
          condition.
        This is particularly useful if your applications commonly use alias names or alias ARNs to refer to 
        KMS keys.
      • Provide very limited permissions.
        An alias must be unique in an AWS account and Region. As a result, giving principals access to a 
        KMS key based on an alias can be much more restrictive than giving them access based on a tag. 
        Unlike aliases, tags can be assigned to multiple KMS keys in the same account and Region. If you 
        choose, you can use an alias pattern, such as alias/test*, to give principals access to a group 
        of KMS keys in the same account and Region. However, allowing or denying access to a particular 
        alias allows very strict control on KMS keys.
      Troubleshooting ABAC for AWS KMS
      Controlling access to KMS keys based on their tags and aliases is convenient and powerful. 
      However, it's prone to a few predictable errors that you'll want to prevent.
      Troubleshooting ABAC for AWS KMS                                                        216

      Access changed due to tag change
      If a tag is deleted or its value is changed, principals who have access to a KMS key based only on 
      that tag will be denied access to the KMS key. This can also happen when a tag that is included in 
      a deny policy statement is added to a KMS key. Adding a policy-related tag to a KMS key can allow 
      access to principals who should be denied access to a KMS key.
      For example, suppose that a principal has access to a KMS key based on the Project=Alpha tag, 
      such as the permission provided by the following example IAM policy statement.
        { 
          "Version": "2012-10-17", 
          "Statement": [ 
            { 
              "Sid": "IAMPolicyWithResourceTag", 
              "Effect": "Allow", 
              "Action": [ 
                "kms:GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext", 
                "kms:Decrypt" 
              ], 
              "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:ap-southeast-1:111122223333:key/*", 
              "Condition": { 
                "StringEquals": { 
                  "aws:ResourceTag/Project": "Alpha" 
                } 
              } 
            } 
          ]
        }
      If the tag is deleted from that KMS key or the tag value is changed, the principal no longer has 
      permission to use the KMS key for the speciﬁed operations. This might become evident when the 
      principal tries to read or write data in an AWS service that uses a customer managed key To trace 
      the tag change, review your CloudTrail logs for TagResource or UntagResource entries.
      To restore access without updating the policy, change the tags on the KMS key. This action has 
      minimal impact other than a brief period while it is taking eﬀect throughout AWS KMS. To prevent 
      an error like this one, give tagging and untagging permissions only to principals who need it and
      limit their tagging permissions to tags they need to manage. Before changing a tag, search policies 
      to detect access that depends on the tag, and get KMS keys in all Regions that have the tag. You 
      might consider creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm when particular tags are changed.

      Access change due to alias change
      If an alias is deleted or associated with a diﬀerent KMS key, principals who have access to the KMS 
      key based only on that alias will be denied access to the KMS key. This can also happen when an 
      alias that is associated with a KMS key is included in a deny policy statement. Adding a policy-
      related alias to a KMS key can also allow access to principals who should be denied access to a KMS 
      key.
      For example, the following IAM policy statement uses the kms:ResourceAliases condition key to 
      allow access to KMS keys in diﬀerent Regions of the account with any of the speciﬁed aliases.
        { 
          "Version": "2012-10-17", 
          "Statement": [ 
            {

                "kms:List*", 
                "kms:Describe*", 
                "kms:Decrypt" 
              ], 
              "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:*:111122223333:key/*", 
              "Condition": { 
                "ForAnyValue:StringEquals": { 
                  "kms:ResourceAliases": [ 
                    "alias/ProjectAlpha", 
                    "alias/ProjectAlpha_Test", 
                    "alias/ProjectAlpha_Dev" 
                  ] 
                } 
              } 
            } 
          ]
        }
      To trace the alias change, review your CloudTrail logs for CreateAlias, UpdateAlias, and DeleteAlias
      entries.
      To restore access without updating the policy, change the alias associated with the KMS key. 
      Because each alias can be associated with only one KMS key in an account and Region, managing

      aliases is a bit more diﬃcult than managing tags. Restoring access to some principals on one KMS 
      key can deny the same or other principals access to a diﬀerent KMS key.
      To prevent this error, give alias management permissions only to principals who need it and limit 
      their alias-management permissions to aliases they need to manage. Before updating or deleting 
      an alias, search policies to detect access that depends on the alias, and ﬁnd KMS keys in all Regions 
      that are associated with the alias.
      Access denied due to alias quota
      Users who are authorized to use a KMS key by an kms:ResourceAliases condition will get an
      AccessDenied exception if the KMS key exceeds the default aliases per KMS key quota for that 
      account and Region.
      To restore access, delete aliases that are associated with the KMS key so it complies with the quota. 
      Or use an alternate mechanism to give users access to the KMS key.
      Delayed authorization change
      Changes that you make to tags and aliases might take up to ﬁve minutes to aﬀect the 
      authorization of KMS keys. As a result, a tag or alias change might be reﬂected in the responses 
      from API operations before they aﬀect authorization. This delay is likely to be longer than the brief 
      eventual consistency delay that aﬀects most AWS KMS operations.
      For example, you might have an IAM policy that allows certain principals to use any KMS key with 
      a "Purpose"="Test" tag. Then you add the "Purpose"="Test" tag to a KMS key. Although the
      TagResource operation completes and ListResourceTags response conﬁrms that the tag is assigned 
      to the KMS key, the principals might not have access to the KMS key for up to ﬁve minutes.
      To prevent errors, build this expected delay into your code.
      Failed requests due to alias updates
      When you update an alias, you associate an existing alias with a diﬀerent KMS key.
      Decrypt and ReEncrypt requests that specify the alias name or alias ARN might fail because the 
      alias is now associated with a KMS key that didn't encrypt the ciphertext. This situation typically 
      returns an IncorrectKeyException or NotFoundException. Or if the request has no KeyId or
      DestinationKeyId parameter, the operation might fail with AccessDenied exception because 
      the caller no longer has access to the KMS key that encrypted the ciphertext.
      Troubleshooting ABAC for AWS KMS                                                       219

      You can trace the change by looking at CloudTrail logs for CreateAlias, UpdateAlias, and
      DeleteAlias log entries. You can also use the value of the LastUpdatedDate ﬁeld in the ListAliases
      response to detect a change.
      For example, the following ListAliases example response shows that the ProjectAlpha_Test
      alias in the kms:ResourceAliases condition was updated. As a result, the principals who have 
      access based on the alias lose access to the previously associated KMS key. Instead, they have 
      access to the newly associated KMS key.
        $ aws kms list-aliases --query 'Aliases[?starts_with(AliasName, `alias/ProjectAlpha`)]'
        { 
            "Aliases": [ 
                { 
                    "AliasName": "alias/ProjectAlpha_Test",

                } 
            ]
        }
      The remedy for this change isn't simple. You can update the alias again to associate it with the 
      original KMS key. However, before you act, you need to consider the eﬀect of that change on the 
      currently associated KMS key. If principals used the latter KMS key in cryptographic operations, 
      they might need continued access to it. In this case, you might want to update the policy to ensure 
      that principals have permission to use both of the KMS keys.
      You can prevent an error like this one: Before updating an alias, search policies to detect access 
      that depends on the alias. Then get KMS keys in all Regions that are associated with the alias. Give 
      alias management permissions only to principals who need it and limit their alias-management 
      permissions to aliases they need to manage.

      RBAC for AWS KMS
      Role-based access control (RBAC) is an authorization strategy that only provides users with the 
      permissions required to perform their job duties, and nothing more. AWS KMS supports RBAC by 
      allowing you to control access to your keys by specifying granular permissions on key usage within
      key policies. Key policies specify a resource, action, eﬀect, principal, and optional conditions to 
      grant access to keys.
      To implement RBAC in AWS KMS, we recommend separating the permissions for key users and key 
      administrators.
      Key users
         The following key policy example allows the ExampleUserRole IAM role to use the KMS key.
           { 
                       "Sid": "Allow use of the key", 
                       "Effect": "Allow", 
                       "Principal": { 
                           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/ExampleUserRole" 
                       }, 
                       "Action": [ 
                           "kms:Encrypt", 
                           "kms:Decrypt", 
                           "kms:ReEncrypt*", 
                           "kms:GenerateDataKey*", 
                           "kms:DescribeKey" 
                       ], 
                       "Resource": "*" 
             }
         Your key users might need fewer permissions than the user in this example. Only assign 
         the permissions that the user needs. Use the following questions to help you further reﬁne 
         permissions.
         • Which IAM principals (roles or users) need access to the key?
         • Which actions does each principal need to perform with the key? For example, does the 
           principal only need Encrypt and Sign permissions?
         • Is the user a human or an AWS service? If it's an AWS service, you can use the condition key to 
           restrict key usage to a speciﬁc AWS service.

                           "kms:TagResource", 
                           "kms:UntagResource", 
                           "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion", 
                           "kms:CancelKeyDeletion" 
                       ], 
                       "Resource": "*" 
               }
         Your key administrators might need fewer permissions than the administrator in this example. 
         Only assign the permissions that your key administrators need.
      Only give users the permissions they need to fulﬁll their roles. A user's permissions might vary 
      depending on whether the key is used in test or production environments. If you use less restrictive 
      permissions in certain non-production environments, implement a process to test the policies 
      before they're released to production.

      Allowing users in other accounts to use a KMS key
      You can allow users or roles in a diﬀerent AWS account to use a KMS key in your account. Cross-
      account access requires permission in the key policy of the KMS key and in an IAM policy in the 
      external user's account.
      Cross-account permission is eﬀective only for the following operations:
      • Cryptographic operations
      • CreateGrant
      • DescribeKey
      • GetKeyRotationStatus
      • GetPublicKey
      • ListGrants
      • RetireGrant
      • RevokeGrant
      If you give a user in a diﬀerent account permission for other operations, those permissions have no 
      eﬀect. For example, if you give a principal in a diﬀerent account kms:ListKeys permission in an IAM 
      policy, or kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion permission on a KMS key in a key policy, the user's attempts to 
      call those operations on your resources still fail.
      For details about using KMS keys in diﬀerent accounts for AWS KMS operations, see the Cross-
      account use column in the AWS KMS permissions and Using KMS keys in other accounts. There is 
      also a Cross-account use section in each API description in the AWS Key Management Service API 
      Reference.
           Warning
           Be cautious about giving principals permissions to use your KMS keys. Whenever possible, 
           follow the least privilege principle. Give users access only to the KMS keys they need for 
           only the operations they require.
      Cross-account access                                                                    223

         Also, be cautious about using any unfamiliar KMS key, especially a KMS key in a diﬀerent 
         account. Malicious users might give you permissions to use their KMS key to get 
         information about you or your account.
         For information about using policies to protect the resources in your account, see Best 
         practices for IAM policies.
     To give permission to use a KMS key to users and roles in another account, you must use two 
     diﬀerent types of policies:
     • The key policy for the KMS key must give the external account (or users and roles in the external 
       account) permission to use the KMS key. The key policy is in the account that owns the KMS key.
     • IAM policies in the external account must delegate the key policy permissions to its users and 
       roles. These policies are set in the external account and give permissions to users and roles in 
       that account.
     The key policy determines who can have access to the KMS key. The IAM policy determines who
     does have access to the KMS key. Neither the key policy nor the IAM policy alone is suﬃcient—you 
     must change both.
     To edit the key policy, you can use the Policy View in the AWS Management Console or use the
     CreateKey or PutKeyPolicy operations.
     For help with editing IAM policies, see Using IAM policies with AWS KMS.
     For an example that shows how the key policy and IAM policies work together to allow use of a 
     KMS key in a diﬀerent account, see Example 2: User assumes role with permission to use a KMS key 
     in a diﬀerent AWS account.
     You can view the resulting cross-account AWS KMS operations on the KMS key in your AWS 
     CloudTrail logs. Operations that use KMS keys in other accounts are logged in both the caller's 
     account and the KMS key owner account.

      • Using KMS keys in other accounts
           Note
           The examples in this topic show how to use a key policy and IAM policy together to provide 
           and limit access to a KMS key. These generic examples are not intended to represent 
           the permissions that any particular AWS service requires on a KMS key. For information 
           about the permissions that an AWS service requires, see the encryption topic in the service 
           documentation.
      Step 1: Add a key policy statement in the local account
      The key policy for a KMS key is the primary determinant of who can access the KMS key and which 
      operations they can perform. The key policy is always in the account that owns the KMS key. Unlike 
      IAM policies, key policies do not specify a resource. The resource is the KMS key that is associated 
      with the key policy. When providing cross-account permission, the key policy for the KMS key must 
      give the external account (or users and roles in the external account) permission to use the KMS 
      key.
      To give an external account permission to use the KMS key, add a statement to the key policy that 
      speciﬁes the external account. In the Principal element of the key policy, enter the Amazon 
      Resource Name (ARN) of the external account.
      When you specify an external account in a key policy, IAM administrators in the external account 
      can use IAM policies to delegate those permissions to any users and roles in the external account. 
      They can also decide which of the actions speciﬁed in the key policy the users and roles can 
      perform.
      Permissions given to the external account and its principals are eﬀective only if the external 
      account is enabled in the Region that hosts the KMS key and its key policy. For information about 
      Regions that are not enabled by default ("opt-in Regions"), see Managing AWS Regions in the AWS 
      General Reference.
      For example, suppose you want to allow account 444455556666 to use a symmetric encryption 
      KMS key in account 111122223333. To do that, add a policy statement like the one in the 
      following example to the key policy for the KMS key in account 111122223333. This policy

      statement gives the external account, 444455556666, permission to use the KMS key in 
      cryptographic operations for symmetric encryption KMS keys.
           Note
           The following example represents a sample key policy for sharing a KMS key with another 
           account. Replace the example Sid, Principal, and Action values with valid values for 
           the intended use of your KMS key.
        { 
            "Sid": "Allow an external account to use this KMS key", 
            "Effect": "Allow", 
            "Principal": { 
                "AWS": [ 
                    "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root" 
                ] 
            }, 
            "Action": [ 
                 "kms:Encrypt", 
                "kms:Decrypt", 
                "kms:ReEncrypt*", 
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*", 
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ], 
            "Resource": "*"
        }
      Instead of giving permission to the external account, you can specify particular external users 
      and roles in the key policy . However, those users and roles cannot use the KMS key until IAM 
      administrators in the external account attach the proper IAM policies to their identities. The IAM 
      policies can give permission to all or a subset of the external users and roles that are speciﬁed in 
      the key policy. And they can allow all or a subset of the actions speciﬁed in the key policy.
      Specifying identities in a key policy restricts the permissions that IAM administrators in the external 
      account can provide. However, it makes policy management with two accounts more complex. For 
      example, assume that you need to add a user or role. You must add that identity to the key policy 
      in the account that owns the KMS key and create IAM policies in the identity's account.
      Step 1: Add a key policy statement in the local account                                 226

      To specify particular external users or roles in a key policy, in the Principal element, enter the 
      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a user or role in the external account.
      For example, the following example key policy statement allows ExampleRole in account
      444455556666 to use a KMS key in account 111122223333. This key policy statement gives the 
      external account, 444455556666, permission to use the KMS key in cryptographic operations for 
      symmetric encryption KMS keys.
           Note
           The following example represents a sample key policy for sharing a KMS key with another 
           account. Replace the example Sid, Principal, and Action values with valid values for 
           the intended use of your KMS key.
        { 
            "Sid": "Allow an external account to use this KMS key", 
            "Effect": "Allow", 
            "Principal": { 
                 "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/ExampleRole"
            }, 
            "Action": [ 
                 "kms:Encrypt", 
                "kms:Decrypt", 
                "kms:ReEncrypt*", 
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*", 
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ], 
            "Resource": "*"
        }
           Note
           Do not set the Principal to an asterisk (*) in any key policy statement that allows 
           permissions unless you use conditions to limit the key policy. An asterisk gives every 
           identity in every AWS account permission to use the KMS key, unless another policy 
           statement explicitly denies it. Users in other AWS accounts can use your KMS key whenever 
           they have corresponding permissions in their own account.
      Step 1: Add a key policy statement in the local account                                 227
     AWS Key Management Service                                       Developer Guide
     You also need to decide which permissions you want to give to the external account. For example, 
     you might want to give users permission to decrypt but not encrypt, or permission to view the KMS 
     key but not use it. For a list of permissions on KMS keys, see AWS KMS permissions.
     Setting the key policy when you create a KMS key
        When you use the CreateKey operation to create a KMS key, you can use its Policy parameter 
        to specify a key policy that gives an external account, or external users and roles, permission to 
        use the KMS key.
        When you create a KMS key in the AWS Management Console, you also create its key policy. 
        When you select identities in the Key Administrators and Key Users sections, AWS KMS adds 
        policy statements for those identities to the KMS key's key policy. The Key Users section also 
        lets you add external accounts as key users.
        When you enter the account ID of an external account, AWS KMS adds two statements to the 
        key policy. This action only aﬀects the key policy. Users and roles in the external account cannot 
        use the KMS key until you attach IAM policies to give them some or all of these permissions.
        The ﬁrst key policy statement gives the external account permission to use the KMS key in 
        cryptographic operations. The second key policy statement allows the external account to 
        create, view, and revoke grants on the KMS key, but only when the request comes from an
        AWS service that is integrated with AWS KMS. These permissions allow other AWS services 
        that encrypt user data to use the KMS key. These permissions are designed for KMS keys that 
        encrypt user data in AWS services
     Step 2: Add IAM policies in the external account
     The key policy in the account that owns the KMS key sets the valid range for permissions. But, 
     users and roles in the external account cannot use the KMS key until you attach IAM policies that 
     delegate those permissions, or use grants to manage access to the KMS key. The IAM policies are 
     set in the external account.
     If the key policy gives permission to the external account, you can attach IAM policies to any user or 
     role in the account. But if the key policy gives permission to speciﬁed users or roles, the IAM policy 
     can only give those permissions to all or a subset of the speciﬁed users and roles. If an IAM policy 
     gives KMS key access to other external users or roles, it has no eﬀect.
     Step 2: Add IAM policies in the external account                       228
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      The key policy also limits the actions in the IAM policy. The IAM policy can delegate all or a subset 
      of the actions speciﬁed in the key policy. If the IAM policy lists actions that are not speciﬁed in the 
      key policy, those permissions are not eﬀective.
      The following example IAM policy allows the principal to use the KMS key in account
      111122223333 for cryptographic operations. To give this permission to users and roles in account
      444455556666, attach the policy to the users or roles in account 444455556666.
           Note
           The following example represents a sample IAM policy for sharing a KMS key with another 
           account. Replace the example Sid, Resource, and Action values with valid values for the 
           intended use of your KMS key.
        { 
            "Sid": "AllowUseOfKeyInAccount111122223333", 
            "Effect": "Allow", 
            "Action": [ 
               "kms:Encrypt", 
              "kms:Decrypt", 
              "kms:ReEncrypt*", 
              "kms:GenerateDataKey*", 
              "kms:DescribeKey"
            ], 
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-
        west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
        }
      Note the following details about this policy:
      •
        Unlike key policies, IAM policy statements do not contain the Principal element. In IAM 
        policies, the principal is the identity to which the policy is attached.
      •
        The Resource element in the IAM policy identiﬁes the KMS key that the principal can use. To 
        specify a KMS key, add its key ARN to the Resource element.
      •
        You can specify more than one KMS key in the Resource element. But if you don't specify 
        particular KMS keys in the Resource element, you might inadvertently give access to more KMS 
        keys than you intend.

      • To allow the external user to use the KMS key with AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS,
        you might need to add permissions to the key policy or the IAM policy. For details, see Allowing 
        use of external KMS keys with AWS services.
      For more information about working with IAM policies, see IAM policies.
      Allowing use of external KMS keys with AWS services
      You can give a user in a diﬀerent account permission to use your KMS key with a service that is 
      integrated with AWS KMS. For example, a user in an external account can use your KMS key to 
      encrypt the objects in an Amazon S3 bucket or to encrypt the secrets they store in AWS Secrets 
      Manager.
      The key policy must give the external user or the external user's account permission to use the 
      KMS key. In addition, you need to attach IAM policies to the identity that gives the user permission 
      to use the AWS service. The service might also require that users have additional permissions in 
      the key policy or IAM policy. For a list of permissions that the AWS service requires on a customer 
      managed key, see the Data Protection topic in the Security chapter of the user guide or developer 
      guide for the service.
      Using KMS keys in other accounts
      If you have permission to use a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you can use the KMS key in the 
      AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, and AWS Tools for PowerShell.
      To identify a KMS key in a diﬀerent account in a shell command or API request, use the following
      key identiﬁers.
      • For cryptographic operations, DescribeKey, and GetPublicKey, use the key ARN or alias ARN of 
        the KMS key.
      • For CreateGrant, GetKeyRotationStatus, ListGrants, and RevokeGrant, use the key ARN of the 
        KMS key.
      If you enter only a key ID or alias name, AWS assumes the KMS key is in your account.
      The AWS KMS console does not display KMS keys in other accounts, even if you have permission to 
      use them. Also, the lists of KMS keys displayed in the consoles of other AWS services do not include 
      KMS keys in other accounts.

      To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent account in the console of an AWS service, you must enter 
      the key ARN or alias ARN of the KMS key. The required key identiﬁer varies with the service, 
      and might diﬀer between the service console and its API operations. For details, see the service 
      documentation.
      Control access to multi-Region keys
      You can use multi-Region keys in compliance, disaster recovery, and backup scenarios that would 
      be more complex with single-Region keys. However, because the security properties of multi-
      Region keys are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of single-Region keys, we recommend using 
      caution when authorizing the creation, management, and use of multi-Region keys.
           Note
           Existing IAM policy statements with wildcard characters in the Resource ﬁeld now apply 
           to both single-Region and multi-Region keys. To restrict them to single-Region KMS keys or 
           multi-Region keys, use the kms:MultiRegion condition key.
      Use your authorization tools to prevent creation and use of multi-Region keys in any scenario 
      where a single-Region will suﬃce. Allow principals to replicate a multi-Region key only into AWS 
      Regions that require them. Give permission for multi-Region keys only to principals who need them 
      and only for tasks that require them.
      You can use key policies, IAM policies, and grants to allow IAM principals to manage and use multi-
      Region keys in your AWS account. Each multi-Region key is an independent resource with a unique 
      key ARN and key policy. You need to establish and maintain a key policy for each key and make 
      sure that new and existing IAM policies implement your authorization strategy.
      To support multi-Region keys, AWS KMS uses an IAM service linked role. This role gives AWS KMS 
      the permissions it needs to synchronize shared properties. For more information, see Authorizing 
      AWS KMS to synchronize multi-Region keys.

      Authorization basics for multi-Region keys
      When designing key policies and IAM policies for multi-Region keys, consider the following 
      principles.
      • Key policy — Each multi-Region key is an independent KMS key resource with its own key policy. 
        You can apply the same or a diﬀerent key policy to each key in the set of related multi-Region 
        keys. Key policies are not shared properties of multi-Region keys. AWS KMS does not copy or 
        synchronize key policies among related multi-Region keys.
        When you create a replica key in the AWS KMS console, the console displays the current 
        key policy of the primary key as a convenience. You can use this key policy, edit it, or delete 
        and replace it. But even if you accept the primary key policy unchanged, AWS KMS doesn't 
        synchronize the policies. For example, if you change the key policy of the primary key, the key 
        policy of the replica key remains the same.
      • Default key policy — When you create multi-Region keys by using the CreateKey and
        ReplicateKey operations, the default key policy is applied unless you specify a key policy in 
        the request. This is the same default key policy that is applied to single-Region keys.
      • IAM policies — As with all KMS keys, you can use IAM policies to control access to multi-Region 
        keys only when the key policy allows it. IAM policies apply to all AWS Regions by default. 
        However, you can use condition keys, such as aws:RequestedRegion, to limit permissions to a 
        particular Region.
        To create primary and replica keys, principals must have kms:CreateKey permission in an IAM 
        policy that applies to the Region where the key is created.
      • Grants — AWS KMS grants are Regional. Each grant allows permissions to one KMS key. You can 
        use grants to allow permissions to a multi-Region primary key or replica key. But you cannot use 
        a single grant to allow permissions to multiple KMS keys, even if they are related multi-Region 
        keys.
      • Key ARN — Each multi-Region key has a unique key ARN. The key ARNs of related multi-Region 
        keys have the same partition, account, and key ID, but diﬀerent Regions.
        To apply an IAM policy statement to a particular multi-Region key, use its key ARN or a key ARN 
        pattern that includes the Region. To apply an IAM policy statement to all related multi-Region 
        keys, use a wildcard character (*) in the Region element of the ARN, as shown in the following 
        example.

            }
          }
        To apply a policy statement to all multi-Region keys in your AWS account, you can use the
        kms:MultiRegion policy condition or a key ID pattern that includes the distinctive mrk- preﬁx.
      • Service-linked role — Principals who create multi-Region primary keys must have
        iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission.
        To synchronize the shared properties of related multi-Region keys, AWS KMS assumes 
        an IAM service-linked role. AWS KMS creates the service-linked role in the AWS account 
        whenever you create a multi-Region primary key. (If the role exists, AWS KMS recreates it, 
        which has no harmful eﬀect.) The role is valid in all Regions. To allow AWS KMS to create (or 
        recreate) the service-linked role, principals who create multi-Region primary keys must have
        iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission.
      Authorizing multi-Region key administrators and users
      Principals who create and manage multi-Region keys need the following permissions in the 
      primary and replica Regions:
      •
        kms:CreateKey
      •
        kms:ReplicateKey
      •
        kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion
      •
        iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole
      Creating a primary key
      To create a multi-Region primary key, the principal needs kms:CreateKey and
      iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permissions in an IAM policy that is eﬀective in the primary key's

      Region. Principals who have these permissions can create single-Region and multi-Region keys 
      unless you restrict their permissions.
      The iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission allows AWS KMS to create the
      AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceMultiRegionKeys role to synchronize the shared 
      properties of related multi-Region keys.
      For example, this IAM policy allows a principal to create any type of KMS key.
        { 
          "Version": "2012-10-17", 
          "Statement":{ 
              "Action": [ 
                "kms:CreateKey", 
                "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole" 
              ], 
              "Effect":"Allow", 
              "Resource":"*" 
          }
        }
      To allow or deny permission to create multi-Region primary keys, use the kms:MultiRegion
      condition key. Valid values are true (multi-Region key) or false (single-Region key). For example, 
      the following IAM policy statement uses a Deny action with the kms:MultiRegion condition key 
      to prevent principals from creating multi-Region keys.
        { 
          "Version": "2012-10-17", 
          "Statement":{ 
              "Action":"kms:CreateKey", 
              "Effect":"Deny", 
              "Resource":"*", 
              "Condition": { 
                  "Bool": "kms:MultiRegion": true
              } 
          }
        }
      Replicating keys
      To create a multi-Region replica key, the principal needs the following permissions:
      Authorizing multi-Region key administrators and users                                   234
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      • kms:ReplicateKey permission in the key policy of the primary key.
      • kms:CreateKey permission in an IAM policy that is eﬀective in the replica key Region.
      Use caution when allowing these permissions. They allow principals to create KMS keys and the key 
      policies that authorize their use. The kms:ReplicateKey permission also authorizes the transfer 
      of key material across Region boundaries within AWS KMS.
      To restrict the AWS Regions in which a multi-Region key can be replicated, use the
      kms:ReplicaRegion condition key. It limits only the kms:ReplicateKey permission. Otherwise, it 
      has no eﬀect. For example, the following key policy allows the principal to replicate this primary 
      key, but only in the speciﬁed Regions.
        { 
          "Effect": "Allow", 
          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Administrator" 
          }, 
          "Action": "kms:ReplicateKey", 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Condition": { 
            "StringEquals": { 
              "kms:ReplicaRegion": [ 
                 "us-east-1", 
                 "eu-west-3", 
                 "ap-southeast-2" 
              ] 
            } 
          }
        }
      Updating the primary Region
      Authorized principals can convert a replica key to a primary key, which changes the former primary 
      key into a replica. This action is known as updating the primary Region. To update the primary 
      Region, the principal needs kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion permission in both Regions. You can provide 
      these permissions in a key policy or IAM policy.
      •
        kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion on the primary key. This permission must be eﬀective in the 
        primary key Region.

      •
        kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion on the replica key. This permission must be eﬀective in the replica 
        key Region.
      For example, the following key policy gives users who can assume the Administrator role 
      permission to update the primary Region of the KMS key. This KMS key can be the primary key or a 
      replica key in this operation.
        { 
          "Effect": "Allow", 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Administrator" 
          }, 
          "Action": "kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion"
        }
      To restrict the AWS Regions that can host a primary key, use the kms:PrimaryRegion condition 
      key. For example, the following IAM policy statement allows the principals to update the primary 
      Region of the multi-Region keys in the AWS account, but only when the new primary Region is one 
      of the speciﬁed Regions.
        { 
          "Effect": "Allow",   
          "Action": "kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion",

      Using and managing multi-Region keys
      By default, principals who have permission to use and manage KMS keys in an AWS account and 
      Region also have permission to use and manage multi-Region keys. However, you can use the
      kms:MultiRegion condition key to allow only single-Region keys or only multi-Region keys. Or use 
      the kms:MultiRegionKeyType condition key to allow only multi-Region primary keys or only replica 
      keys. Both condition keys controls access to the CreateKey operation and to any operation that uses 
      an existing KMS key, such as Encrypt or EnableKey.
      The following example IAM policy statement uses the kms:MultiRegion condition key to prevent 
      the principals from using or managing any multi-Region key.
        { 
          "Effect": "Deny",   
          "Action": "kms:*", 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Condition": { 
            "Bool": "kms:MultiRegion": true 
          }
        }
      This example IAM policy statement uses the kms:MultiRegionKeyType condition to allow 
      principals to schedule and cancel key deletion, but only on multi-Region replica keys.

          "Effect": "Allow",

      Determining access to AWS KMS keys
      To determine the full extent of who or what currently has access to an AWS KMS key, you must 
      examine the key policy of the KMS key, all grants that apply to the KMS key, and potentially all 
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. You might do this to determine the scope 
      of potential usage of a KMS key, or to help you meet compliance or auditing requirements. The 
      following topics can help you generate a complete list of the AWS principals (identities) that 
      currently have access to a KMS key.
      Topics
      • Examining the key policy
      • Examining IAM policies
      • Examining grants
      Examining the key policy
      Key policies are the primary way to control access to KMS keys. Every KMS key has exactly one key 
      policy.
      When a key policy consists of or includes the default key policy, the key policy allows IAM 
      administrators in the account to use IAM policies to control access to the KMS key. Also, if the key 
      policy gives another AWS account permission to use the KMS key, the IAM administrators in the 
      external account can use IAM policies to delegate those permissions. To determine the complete 
      list of principals that can access the KMS key, examine the IAM policies.
      To view the key policy of an AWS KMS  customer managed key or AWS managed key in your 
      account, use the AWS Management Console or the GetKeyPolicy operation in the AWS KMS API. 
      To view the key policy, you must have kms:GetKeyPolicy permissions for the KMS key. For 
      instructions for viewing the key policy for a KMS key, see the section called “View a key policies”.
      Examine the key policy document and take note of all principals speciﬁed in each policy 
      statement's Principal element. In a policy statement with an Allow eﬀect, the IAM users, IAM 
      roles, and AWS accounts in the Principal element have access to this KMS key.
          Note
          Do not set the Principal to an asterisk (*) in any key policy statement that allows 
          permissions unless you use conditions to limit the key policy. An asterisk gives every

           identity in every AWS account permission to use the KMS key, unless another policy 
           statement explicitly denies it. Users in other AWS accounts can use your KMS key whenever 
           they have corresponding permissions in their own account.
      The following examples use the policy statements found in the default key policy to demonstrate 
      how to do this.
      Example Policy statement 1
        { 
          "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions", 
          "Effect": "Allow", 
           "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"},
          "Action": "kms:*", 
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      In policy statement 1, arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root is an AWS account principal that 
      refers to the AWS account 111122223333. (It is not the account root user.) By default, a policy 
      statement like this one is included in the key policy document when you create a new KMS key with 
      the AWS Management Console, or create a new KMS key programmatically but do not provide a 
      key policy.
      A key policy document with a statement that allows access to the AWS account enables IAM 
      policies in the account to allow access to the KMS key. This means that users and roles in the 
      account might have access to the KMS key even if they are not explicitly listed as principals in the 
      key policy document. Take care to examine all IAM policies in all AWS accounts listed as principals 
      to determine whether they allow access to this KMS key.

      role named EncryptionApp in AWS account 111122223333. Principals who are authorized assume 
      this role are allowed to perform the actions listed in the policy statement. These actions, when 
      combined with the actions allowed in Example policy statement 3, are those necessary to delegate 
      use of the KMS key to most AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS, speciﬁcally the services 
      that use grants. The kms:GrantIsForAWSResource value in the Condition element ensures that 
      the delegation is allowed only when the delegate is an AWS service that integrates with AWS KMS 
      and uses grants for authorization.

      Principal in the IAM User Guide.
      To learn more about AWS KMS key policies, see Key policies in AWS KMS.
      Examining IAM policies
      In addition to the key policy and grants, you can also use IAM policies to allow access to a KMS key.

      AWS KMS permissions.
      To determine which principals currently have access to a KMS key through IAM policies, you can use

      2.  In the Users, Groups, and Roles pane, choose the user, group, or role whose policies you want 
          to simulate.
      3.  (Optional) Clear the check box next to any policies that you want to omit from the simulation. 
          To simulate all policies, leave all policies selected.
      4.  In the Policy Simulator pane, do the following:
          a.  For Select service, choose Key Management Service.
          b.  To simulate speciﬁc AWS KMS actions, for Select actions, choose the actions to simulate. 
              To simulate all AWS KMS actions, choose Select All.
      5.  (Optional) The Policy Simulator simulates access to all KMS keys by default. To simulate access 
          to a speciﬁc KMS key, choose Simulation Settingsand then type the Amazon Resource Name 
          (ARN) of the KMS key to simulate.
      6.  Choose Run Simulation.
      You can view the results of the simulation in the Results section. Repeat steps 2 through 6 for 
      every user, group, and role in the AWS account.
      Examining IAM policies with the IAM API
      You can use the IAM API to examine IAM policies programmatically. The following steps provide a 
      general overview of how to do this:
      1. For each AWS account listed as a principal in the key policy (that is, each
         AWS account principal speciﬁed in this format: "Principal": {"AWS": 
         "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"}), use the ListUsers and ListRoles operations in the 
         IAM API to get all users and roles in the account.
      2. For each user and role in the list, use the SimulatePrincipalPolicy operation in the IAM API, 
         passing in the following parameters:
      Examining IAM policies                                                                  242
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
         •
           For PolicySourceArn, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a user or role from your 
           list. You can specify only one PolicySourceArn for each SimulatePrincipalPolicy
           request, so you must call this operation multiple times, once for each user and role in your list.
         •
           For the ActionNames list, specify every AWS KMS API action to simulate. To simulate all AWS 
           KMS API actions, use kms:*. To test individual AWS KMS API actions, precede each API action 
           with "kms:", for example "kms:ListKeys". For a complete list of AWS KMS API actions, see
           Actions in the AWS Key Management Service API Reference.
         • (Optional) To determine whether the users or roles have access to speciﬁc KMS keys, use the
           ResourceArns parameter to specify a list of the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the 
           KMS keys. To determine whether the users or roles have access to any KMS key, omit the
           ResourceArns parameter.
      IAM responds to each SimulatePrincipalPolicy request with an evaluation decision:
      allowed, explicitDeny, or implicitDeny. For each response that contains an evaluation 
      decision of allowed, the response includes the name of the speciﬁc AWS KMS API operation that 
      is allowed. It also includes the ARN of the KMS key that was used in the evaluation, if any.
      Examining grants
      Grants are advanced mechanisms for specifying permissions that you or an AWS service integrated 
      with AWS KMS can use to specify how and when a KMS key can be used. Grants are attached to a 
      KMS key, and each grant contains the principal who receives permission to use the KMS key and a 
      list of operations that are allowed. Grants are an alternative to the key policy, and are useful for 
      speciﬁc use cases. For more information, see Grants in AWS KMS.
      To get a list of grants for a KMS key, use the AWS KMS ListGrants operation. You can examine the 
      grants for a KMS key to determine who or what currently has access to use the KMS key via those 
      grants. For example, the following is a JSON representation of a grant that was obtained from the
      list-grants command in the AWS CLI.
        {"Grants": [{ 
          "Operations": ["Decrypt"], 
          "KeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-
        west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab", 
          "Name": "0d8aa621-43ef-4657-b29c-3752c41dc132", 
          "RetiringPrincipal": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root", 
           "GranteePrincipal": "arn:aws:sts::111122223333:assumed-role/aws:ec2-infrastructure/
        i-5d476fab",
      Examining grants                                                                        243
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
          "GrantId": "dc716f53c93acacf291b1540de3e5a232b76256c83b2ecb22cdefa26576a2d3e", 
          "IssuingAccount": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root", 
          "CreationDate": 1.444151834E9, 
          "Constraints": {"EncryptionContextSubset": {"aws:ebs:id": "vol-5cccfb4e"}}
        }]}
      To ﬁnd out who or what has access to use the KMS key, look for the "GranteePrincipal"
      element. In the preceding example, the grantee principal is an assumed role user that is associated 
      with the EC2 instance i-5d476fab. The EC2 infrastructure uses this role to attach the encrypted 
      EBS volume vol-5cccfb4e to the instance. In this case, the EC2 infrastructure role has permission to 
      use the KMS key because you previously created an encrypted EBS volume that is protected by this 
      KMS key. You then attached the volume to an EC2 instance.
      The following is another example of a JSON representation of a grant that was obtained from the
      list-grants command in the AWS CLI. In the following example, the grantee principal is another 
      AWS account.
        {"Grants": [{ 
          "Operations": ["Encrypt"], 
          "KeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-
        west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab", 
          "Name": "", 
           "GranteePrincipal": "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root",
          "GrantId": "f271e8328717f8bde5d03f4981f06a6b3fc18bcae2da12ac38bd9186e7925d11", 
          "IssuingAccount": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root", 
          "CreationDate": 1.444151269E9
        }]}
      Encryption context
           Note
           You cannot specify an encryption context in a cryptographic operation with an asymmetric 
           KMS key or an HMAC KMS key. Asymmetric algorithms and MAC algorithms do not support 
           an encryption context.
      All AWS KMS cryptographic operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys accept an encryption 
      context, an optional set of non-secret key–value pairs that can contain additional contextual 
      Encryption context                                                                      244
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      information about the data. You can insert encryption context in Encrypt operations in AWS 
      KMS to enhance the authorization and auditability of your AWS KMS API decryption calls. AWS 
      KMS uses the encryption context as additional authenticated data (AAD) to support authenticated 
      encryption. The encryption context is cryptographically bound to the ciphertext so that the same 
      encryption context is required to decrypt the data.
      The encryption context is not secret and not encrypted. It appears in plaintext in AWS CloudTrail 
      Logs so you can use it to identify and categorize your cryptographic operations. Your encryption 
      context should not include sensitive information. We recommend that your encryption context 
      describe the data being encrypted or decrypted. For example, when you encrypt a ﬁle, you might 
      use part of the ﬁle path as encryption context.
        "encryptionContext": { 
            "department": "10103.0"
        }     
      For example, when encrypting volumes and snapshots created with the Amazon Elastic Block Store
      (Amazon EBS) CreateSnapshot operation, Amazon EBS uses the volume ID as encryption context 
      value.
        "encryptionContext": { 
          "aws:ebs:id": "vol-abcde12345abc1234"
        }
      You can also use the encryption context to reﬁne or limit access to AWS KMS keys in your 
      account. You can use the encryption context as a constraint in grants and as a condition in policy 
      statements.
      To learn how to use encryption context to protect the integrity of encrypted data, see the post
      How to Protect the Integrity of Your Encrypted Data by Using AWS Key Management Service and 
      EncryptionContext on the AWS Security Blog.
      Encryption context rules
      AWS KMS enforces the following rules for encryption context keys and values.
      • The key and value in an encryption context pair must be simple literal strings. If you use a 
        diﬀerent type, such as an integer or ﬂoat, AWS KMS interprets it as a string.
      Encryption context rules                                                                245
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      • The keys and values in an encryption context can include Unicode characters. If an 
        encryption context includes characters that are not permitted in key policies or IAM policies, 
        you won't be able to specify the encryption context in policy condition keys, such as
        kms:EncryptionContext:context-key and kms:EncryptionContextKeys. For details 
        about key policy document rules, see Key policy format. For details about IAM policy document 
        rules, see IAM name requirements in the IAM User Guide.
      Encryption context in policies
      The encryption context is used primarily to verify integrity and authenticity. But you can also use 
      the encryption context to control access to symmetric encryption AWS KMS keys in key policies and 
      IAM policies.
      The kms:EncryptionContext: and kms:EncryptionContextKeys condition keys allow (or deny) a 
      permission only when the request includes particular encryption context keys or key–value pairs.
      For example, the following key policy statement allows the RoleForExampleApp role to use 
      the KMS key in Decrypt operations. It uses the kms:EncryptionContext:context-key
      condition key to allow this permission only when the encryption context in the request includes an
      AppName:ExampleApp encryption context pair.
        { 
          "Effect": "Allow", 
          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/RoleForExampleApp" 
          }, 
          "Action": "kms:Decrypt", 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Condition": { 
            "StringEquals": { 
              "kms:EncryptionContext:AppName": "ExampleApp" 
            } 
          }
        }
      For more information about these encryption context condition keys, see Condition keys for AWS 
      KMS.
      Encryption context in policies                                                          246

      Encryption context in grants
      When you create a grant, you can include grant constraints that establish conditions for the 
      grant permissions. AWS KMS supports two grant constraints, EncryptionContextEquals and
      EncryptionContextSubset, both of which involve the encryption context in a request for a 
      cryptographic operation. When you use these grant constraints, the permissions in the grant are 
      eﬀective only when the encryption context in the request for the cryptographic operation satisﬁes 
      the requirements of the grant constraints.
      For example, you can add an EncryptionContextEquals grant constraint to a grant that allows 
      the GenerateDataKey operation. With this constraint, the grant allows the operation only when the 
      encryption context in the request is a case-sensitive match for the encryption context in the grant 
      constraint.
        $ aws kms create-grant \ 
            --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
            --grantee-principal arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/exampleUser \ 
            --retiring-principal arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/adminRole \ 
            --operations GenerateDataKey \
            --constraints EncryptionContextEquals={Purpose=Test}
      A request like the following from the grantee principal would satisfy the
      EncryptionContextEquals constraint.
        $ aws kms generate-data-key \ 
            --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
            --key-spec AES_256 \ 
            --encryption-context Purpose=Test
      For details about the grant constraints, see Using grant constraints. For detailed information about 
      grants, see the section called “Grants”.
      Logging encryption context
      AWS KMS uses AWS CloudTrail to log the encryption context so you can determine which KMS keys 
      and data have been accessed. The log entry shows exactly which KMS keys was used to encrypt or 
      decrypt speciﬁc data referenced by the encryption context in the log entry.
      Encryption context in grants                                                            247
      AWS Key Management Service                                                 Developer Guide
           Important
           Because the encryption context is logged, it must not contain sensitive information.
      Storing encryption context
      To simplify use of any encryption context when you call the Decrypt or ReEncrypt operations, 
      you can store the encryption context alongside the encrypted data. We recommend that you store 
      only enough of the encryption context to help you create the full encryption context when you 
      need it for encryption or decryption.
      For example, if the encryption context is the fully qualiﬁed path to a ﬁle, store only part of 
      that path with the encrypted ﬁle contents. Then, when you need the full encryption context, 
      reconstruct it from the stored fragment. If someone tampers with the ﬁle, such as renaming it or 
      moving it to a diﬀerent location, the encryption context value changes and the decryption request 
      fails.
      Testing your permissions
      To use AWS KMS, you must have credentials that AWS can use to authenticate your API requests. 
      The credentials must include the permission to access KMS keys and aliases. The permissions are 
      determined by key policies, IAM policies, grants, and cross-account access controls. In addition to 
      controlling access to KMS keys, you can control access to your CloudHSM, and to your custom key 
      stores.
      You can specify the DryRun API parameter to verify that you have the necessary permissions to use 
      AWS KMS keys. You can also use DryRun to verify that the request parameters in a AWS KMS API 
      call are correctly speciﬁed.

      What is the DryRun parameter?
      DryRun is an optional API parameter that you specify to verify that AWS KMS API calls will 
      succeed. Use DryRun to test your API call, before actually making the call to AWS KMS. You can 
      verify the following.
      • That you have the necessary permissions to use AWS KMS keys.
      • That you have speciﬁed the parameters in the call correctly.
      AWS KMS supports using the DryRun parameter in certain API actions:
      • CreateGrant
      • Decrypt
      • DeriveSharedSecret
      • Encrypt
      • GenerateDataKey
      • GenerateDataKeyPair
      • GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext
      • GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
      • GenerateMac
      • ReEncrypt
      • RetireGrant
      • RevokeGrant
      • Sign
      • Verify
      • VerifyMac
      Using the DryRun parameter will incur charges and will be billed as a standard API request. For 
      more information about AWS KMS pricing, see AWS Key Management Service Pricing.
      All API requests using the DryRun parameter apply to the request quota of the API and can 
      result in a throttling exception if you exceed an API request quota. For example, calling Decrypt
      What is DryRun?                                                                         249

      with DryRun or without DryRun counts against the same cryptographic operations quota. See
      Throttling AWS KMS requests to learn more.
      Every call to an AWS KMS API operation is captured as an event and recorded in an AWS CloudTrail 
      log. The output of any operations that specify the DryRun parameter appear in your CloudTrail log. 
      For more information, see Logging AWS KMS API calls with AWS CloudTrail.
      Specifying DryRun with the API
      To use DryRun, specify the —dry-run parameter in AWS CLI commands and AWS KMS API calls 
      that support the parameter. When you do, AWS KMS will verify whether your call will succeed. AWS 
      KMS calls that use DryRun will always fail and return a message with information about reason 
      why the call failed. The message can include the following exceptions:
      •
        DryRunOperationException ‐ The request would succeed if DryRun wasn’t speciﬁed.
      •
        ValidationException ‐ The request failed from specifying an incorrect API parameter.
      •
        AccessDeniedException ‐ You do not have permissions to perform the speciﬁed API action 
        on the KMS resource.
      For example, the following command uses the CreateGrant operation and creates a grant that 
      allows users who are authorized to assume the keyUserRole role to call the Decrypt operation on 
      a speciﬁed symmetric KMS key. The DryRun parameter is speciﬁed.
        $  aws kms create-grant \ 
            --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
            --grantee-principal arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/keyUserRole \ 
            --operations Decrypt \ 
            --dry-run
      Troubleshooting AWS KMS permissions
      When authorizing access to a KMS key, AWS KMS evaluates the following:
      • The key policy that is attached to the KMS key. The key policy is always deﬁned in the AWS 
        account and Region that owns the KMS key.
      • All IAM policies that are attached to the user or role making the request. IAM policies that govern 
        a principal's use of a KMS key are always deﬁned in the principal's AWS account.
      Specifying DryRun with the API                                                          250
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     • All grants that apply to the KMS key.
     • Other types of policies that might apply to the request to use the KMS key, such as AWS 
       Organizations service control policies and VPC endpoint policies. These policies are optional 
       and allow all actions by default, but you can use them to restrict permissions otherwise given to 
       principals.
     AWS KMS evaluates these policy mechanisms together to determine whether access to the 
     KMS key is allowed or denied. To do this, AWS KMS uses a process similar to the one depicted in 
     the following ﬂowchart. The following ﬂowchart provides a visual representation of the policy 
     evaluation process.
     Troubleshooting AWS KMS permissions                               251

     This ﬂowchart is divided into two parts. The parts appear to be sequential, but they are typically 
     evaluated at the same time.

      • Use authorization determines whether you are permitted to use a KMS key based on its key 
        policy, IAM policies, grants, and other applicable policies.
      • Key trust determines whether you should trust a KMS key that you are permitted to use. In 
        general, you trust the resources in your AWS account. But, you can also feel conﬁdent about 
        using KMS keys in a diﬀerent AWS account if a grant or IAM policy in your account allows you to 
        use the KMS key.
      You can use this ﬂowchart to discover why a caller was allowed or denied permission to use a KMS 
      key. You can also use it to evaluate your policies and grants. For example, the ﬂowchart shows that 
      a caller can be denied access by an explicit DENY statement, or by the absence of an explicit ALLOW
      statement, in the key policy, IAM policy, or grant.
      The ﬂowchart can explain some common permission scenarios.
      Permission Examples
      • Example 1: User is denied access to a KMS key in their AWS account
      • Example 2: User assumes role with permission to use a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account
      Example 1: User is denied access to a KMS key in their AWS account
      Alice is an IAM user in the 111122223333 AWS account. She was denied access to a KMS key in 
      same AWS account. Why can't Alice use the KMS key?
      In this case, Alice is denied access to the KMS key because there is no key policy, IAM policy, or 
      grant that gives her the required permissions. The key policy of the KMS key allows the AWS 
      account to use IAM policies to control access to the KMS key, but no IAM policy gives Alice 
      permission to use the KMS key.

      Consider the relevant policies for this example.
      • The KMS key that Alice wants to use has the default key policy. This policy allows the AWS 
        account that owns the KMS key to use IAM policies to control access to the KMS key. This key 
        policy satisﬁes the Does the key policy ALLOW the callers account to use IAM policies to control 
        access to the key? condition in the ﬂowchart.

      • However, no key policy, IAM policy, or grant gives Alice permission to use the KMS key. Therefore, 
        Alice is denied permission to use the KMS key.

          Example 2: User assumes role with permission to use a KMS key in a 
          diﬀerent AWS account
          Bob is a user in account 1 (111122223333). He is allowed to use a KMS key in account 2 
          (444455556666) in cryptographic operations. How is this possible?
                  Tip
                  When evaluating cross-account permissions, remember that the key policy is speciﬁed in 
                  the KMS key's account. The IAM policy is speciﬁed in the caller's account, even when the 
                  caller is in a diﬀerent account. For details about providing cross-account access to KMS 
                  keys, see Allowing users in other accounts to use a KMS key.
          • The key policy for the KMS key in account 2 allows account 2 to use IAM policies to control access 
             to the KMS key.
          • The key policy for the KMS key in account 2 allows account 1 to use the KMS key in cryptographic 
             operations. However, account 1 must use IAM policies to give its principals access to the KMS key.
          •
             An IAM policy in account 1 allows the Engineering role to use the KMS key in account 2 for 
             cryptographic operations.
          •
             Bob, a user in account 1, has permission to assume the Engineering role.
          • Bob can trust this KMS key, because even though it is not in his account, an IAM policy in his 
             account gives him explicit permission to use this KMS key.
          Example 2: User assumes role with permission to use a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account                                                     255

          Consider the policies that let Bob, a user in account 1, use the KMS key in account 2.
          • The key policy for the KMS key allows account 2 (444455556666, the account that owns the 
             KMS key) to use IAM policies to control access to the KMS key. This key policy also allows account 
             1 (111122223333) to use the KMS key in cryptographic operations (speciﬁed in the Action
             element of the policy statement). However, no one in account 1 can use the KMS key in account 2 
             until account 1 deﬁnes IAM policies that give the principals access to the KMS key.
             In the ﬂowchart, this key policy in account 2 satisﬁes the Does the key policy ALLOW the caller's 
             account to use IAM policies to control access to the key? condition.

          • An IAM policy in the caller's AWS account (account 1, 111122223333) gives the principal

             account 1, this inline policy is embedded in the Engineering role.
             Cross-account IAM policies like this one are eﬀective only when the key policy for the KMS key

     Authentication
     Authentication is the process of verifying your identity. To send a request to AWS KMS, you must 
     sign into AWS using your AWS credentials.
     Authorization
     Authorization provides the permission to send requests to create, manage, or use AWS KMS 
     resources. For example, you must be authorized to use a KMS key in a cryptographic operation.
     To control access to your AWS KMS resources, use key policies, IAM policies, and grants. Every KMS 
     key must have a key policy. If the key policy allows it, you can also use IAM policies and grants to 
     give principals access to the KMS key. To reﬁne your authorization, you can use condition keys that 
     allow or deny access only when a request or resource meets the conditions you specify. You can 
     also allow access to principals you trust in other AWS accounts.
     Authenticating with identities
     Authentication is how you sign in to AWS using your identity credentials. You must be
     authenticated (signed in to AWS) as the AWS account root user, as an IAM user, or by assuming an 
     IAM role.
     You can sign in to AWS as a federated identity by using credentials provided through an identity 
     source. AWS IAM Identity Center (IAM Identity Center) users, your company's single sign-on 
     authentication, and your Google or Facebook credentials are examples of federated identities. 
     When you sign in as a federated identity, your administrator previously set up identity federation 
     using IAM roles. When you access AWS by using federation, you are indirectly assuming a role.
     Depending on the type of user you are, you can sign in to the AWS Management Console or the 
     AWS access portal. For more information about signing in to AWS, see How to sign in to your AWS 
     account in the AWS Sign-In User Guide.
     If you access AWS programmatically, AWS provides a software development kit (SDK) and a 
     command line interface (CLI) to cryptographically sign your requests by using your credentials. If 
     you don't use AWS tools, you must sign requests yourself. For more information about using the 
     recommended method to sign requests yourself, see AWS Signature Version 4 for API requests in 
     the IAM User Guide.
     Regardless of the authentication method that you use, you might be required to provide additional 
     security information. For example, AWS recommends that you use multi-factor authentication 
     Authentication                                                         259

      (MFA) to increase the security of your account. To learn more, see Multi-factor authentication in 
      the AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide and AWS Multi-factor authentication in IAM in the IAM User 
      Guide.
      AWS account root user
      When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to 
      all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and 
      is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. 
      We strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks. Safeguard your 
      root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform. For 
      the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see Tasks that require root 
      user credentials in the IAM User Guide.
      Federated identity
      As a best practice, require human users, including users that require administrator access, to use 
      federation with an identity provider to access AWS services by using temporary credentials.
      A federated identity is a user from your enterprise user directory, a web identity provider, the AWS 
      Directory Service, the Identity Center directory, or any user that accesses AWS services by using 
      credentials provided through an identity source. When federated identities access AWS accounts, 
      they assume roles, and the roles provide temporary credentials.
      For centralized access management, we recommend that you use AWS IAM Identity Center. You can 
      create users and groups in IAM Identity Center, or you can connect and synchronize to a set of users 
      and groups in your own identity source for use across all your AWS accounts and applications. For 
      information about IAM Identity Center, see What is IAM Identity Center? in the AWS IAM Identity 
      Center User Guide.
      IAM users and groups
      An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has speciﬁc permissions for a single person 
      or application. Where possible, we recommend relying on temporary credentials instead of creating 
      IAM users who have long-term credentials such as passwords and access keys. However, if you have 
      speciﬁc use cases that require long-term credentials with IAM users, we recommend that you rotate 
      access keys. For more information, see Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require long-
      term credentials in the IAM User Guide.

      AWS Key Management Service                                            Developer Guide
      An IAM group is an identity that speciﬁes a collection of IAM users. You can't sign in as a group. You 
      can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time. Groups make permissions easier 
      to manage for large sets of users. For example, you could have a group named IAMAdmins and give 
      that group permissions to administer IAM resources.
      Users are diﬀerent from roles. A user is uniquely associated with one person or application, but 
      a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Users have permanent long-term 
      credentials, but roles provide temporary credentials. To learn more, see Use cases for IAM users in 
      the IAM User Guide.
      IAM roles
      An IAM role is an identity within your AWS account that has speciﬁc permissions. It is similar to an 
      IAM user, but is not associated with a speciﬁc person. To temporarily assume an IAM role in the 
      AWS Management Console, you can switch from a user to an IAM role (console). You can assume a 
      role by calling an AWS CLI or AWS API operation or by using a custom URL. For more information 
      about methods for using roles, see Methods to assume a role in the IAM User Guide.
      IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations:
      • Federated user access – To assign permissions to a federated identity, you create a role 
        and deﬁne permissions for the role. When a federated identity authenticates, the identity 
        is associated with the role and is granted the permissions that are deﬁned by the role. For 
        information about roles for federation, see  Create a role for a third-party identity provider 
        (federation) in the IAM User Guide. If you use IAM Identity Center, you conﬁgure a permission set. 
        To control what your identities can access after they authenticate, IAM Identity Center correlates 
        the permission set to a role in IAM. For information about permissions sets, see  Permission sets
        in the AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide.
      • Temporary IAM user permissions – An IAM user or role can assume an IAM role to temporarily 
        take on diﬀerent permissions for a speciﬁc task.
      • Cross-account access – You can use an IAM role to allow someone (a trusted principal) in a 
        diﬀerent account to access resources in your account. Roles are the primary way to grant cross-
        account access. However, with some AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a resource 
        (instead of using a role as a proxy). To learn the diﬀerence between roles and resource-based 
        policies for cross-account access, see Cross account resource access in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
      • Cross-service access – Some AWS services use features in other AWS services. For example, when 
        you make a call in a service, it's common for that service to run applications in Amazon EC2 or

       store objects in Amazon S3. A service might do this using the calling principal's permissions, 
       using a service role, or using a service-linked role.
       • Forward access sessions (FAS) – When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in 
        AWS, you are considered a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an 
        action that then initiates another action in a diﬀerent service. FAS uses the permissions of the 
        principal calling an AWS service, combined with the requesting AWS service to make requests 
        to downstream services. FAS requests are only made when a service receives a request that 
        requires interactions with other AWS services or resources to complete. In this case, you must 
        have permissions to perform both actions. For policy details when making FAS requests, see
        Forward access sessions.
       • Service role – A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your 
        behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For 
        more information, see Create a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service in the IAM User 
        Guide.
       • Service-linked role – A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS 
        service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. Service-linked 
        roles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can 
        view, but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.
     • Applications running on Amazon EC2 – You can use an IAM role to manage temporary 
       credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API 
       requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role 
       to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance proﬁle 
       that is attached to the instance. An instance proﬁle contains the role and enables programs that 
       are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Use an 
       IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances in the IAM User 
       Guide.
     Managing access using policies
     You control access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to AWS identities or resources. 
     A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, deﬁnes their 
     permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when a principal (user, root user, or role session) makes 
     a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most 
     policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. For more information about the structure and 
     contents of JSON policy documents, see Overview of JSON policies in the IAM User Guide.
     Managing access using policies                                       262
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
      Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which
      principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.
      By default, users and roles have no permissions. To grant users permission to perform actions on 
      the resources that they need, an IAM administrator can create IAM policies. The administrator can 
      then add the IAM policies to roles, and users can assume the roles.
      IAM policies deﬁne permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the 
      operation. For example, suppose that you have a policy that allows the iam:GetRole action. A 
      user with that policy can get role information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or 
      the AWS API.
      Identity-based policies
      Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, 
      such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These policies control what actions users and roles can 
      perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based 
      policy, see Deﬁne custom IAM permissions with customer managed policies in the IAM User Guide.
      Identity-based policies can be further categorized as inline policies or managed policies. Inline 
      policies are embedded directly into a single user, group, or role. Managed policies are standalone 
      policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. Managed 
      policies include AWS managed policies and customer managed policies. To learn how to choose 
      between a managed policy or an inline policy, see Choose between managed policies and inline 
      policies in the IAM User Guide.
      Resource-based policies
      An AWS KMS key policy is a resource-based policy that controls access to a KMS key. Every KMS key 
      must have a key policy. You can use other authorization mechanism to allow access to the KMS key, 
      but only if the key policy allows it. (You can use an IAM policy to deny access to a KMS key even if 
      the key policy doesn't explicitly permit it.)
      Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource, such as a KMS 
      key, to control access to the speciﬁc resource. The resource-based policy deﬁnes the actions that 
      a speciﬁed principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You don't specify 
      the resource in a resource-based policy, but you must specify a principal, such as accounts, users, 
      roles, federated users, or AWS services. Resource-based policies are inline policies that are located 
      in that service that manages the resource. You can't use AWS managed policies from IAM, such as 
      the AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser managed policy, in a resource-based policy.
      Managing access using policies                                                        263

      Other policy types
      AWS supports additional, less-common policy types. These policy types can set the maximum 
      permissions granted to you by the more common policy types.
      • Permissions boundaries – A permissions boundary is an advanced feature in which you set 
        the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity (IAM user 
        or role). You can set a permissions boundary for an entity. The resulting permissions are the 
        intersection of an entity's identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries. Resource-based 
        policies that specify the user or role in the Principal ﬁeld are not limited by the permissions 
        boundary. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information 
        about permissions boundaries, see Permissions boundaries for IAM entities in the IAM User Guide.
      • Service control policies (SCPs) – SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions 
        for an organization or organizational unit (OU) in AWS Organizations. AWS Organizations is a 
        service for grouping and centrally managing multiple AWS accounts that your business owns. If 
        you enable all features in an organization, then you can apply service control policies (SCPs) to 
        any or all of your accounts. The SCP limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including 
        each AWS account root user. For more information about Organizations and SCPs, see Service 
        control policies in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
      • Resource control policies (RCPs) – RCPs are JSON policies that you can use to set the maximum 
        available permissions for resources in your accounts without updating the IAM policies attached 
        to each resource that you own. The RCP limits permissions for resources in member accounts 
        and can impact the eﬀective permissions for identities, including the AWS account root 
        user, regardless of whether they belong to your organization. For more information about 
        Organizations and RCPs, including a list of AWS services that support RCPs, see Resource control 
        policies (RCPs) in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
      • Session policies – Session policies are advanced policies that you pass as a parameter when you 
        programmatically create a temporary session for a role or federated user. The resulting session's 
        permissions are the intersection of the user or role's identity-based policies and the session 
        policies. Permissions can also come from a resource-based policy. An explicit deny in any of these 
        policies overrides the allow. For more information, see Session policies in the IAM User Guide.

      Multiple policy types
      When multiple types of policies apply to a request, the resulting permissions are more complicated 
      to understand. To learn how AWS determines whether to allow a request when multiple policy 
      types are involved, see Policy evaluation logic in the IAM User Guide.
      AWS KMS resources
      In AWS KMS, the primary resource is an AWS KMS key. AWS KMS also supports an alias, an 
      independent resource that provides a friendly name for a KMS key. Some AWS KMS operations 
      allow you to use an alias to identify a KMS key.
      Each instance of a KMS key or alias has a unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with a standard 
      format. In AWS KMS resources, the AWS service name is kms.

      Create a KMS key
      You can create AWS KMS keys in the AWS Management Console, or by using the CreateKey
      operation or the AWS::KMS::Key AWS CloudFormation resource. During this process, you set the key 
      policy for the KMS key, which you can change at any time. You also select the following values that 
      deﬁne the type of KMS key that you create. You cannot change these properties after the KMS key 
      is created.
      KMS key type
         Key type is a property that determines what type of cryptographic key is created. AWS KMS 
         oﬀers three key types to protect data:
         • Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric keys
           256-bit keys that are used under the Galois Counter Mode (GCM) mode of AES to provide 
           authenticated encryption/decryption of data under 4KB in size. This is the most common 
           type of key and is used to protect other data encryption keys used in your applications and by 
           AWS services that encrypt your data on your behalf.
         • RSA, elliptic curve, or SM2 (China Regions only) asymmetric keys
           These keys are available in various sizes and support many algorithms. They can be used for 
           encryption and decryption, sign and verify, or derive shared secrets operations depending on 
           the algorithm choice.
         • Symmetric keys for performing hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC) operations
           These keys are 256-bit keys used for sign and verify operations.
           KMS keys cannot be exported from the service in plaintext. They are generated by and can 
           only be used within the hardware security modules (HSMs) used by the service. This is the 
           foundational security property of AWS KMS to ensure that keys are not compromised.
      Key usage
         Key usage is a property that determines the cryptographic operations the key supports. KMS 
         keys can have a key usage of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, SIGN_VERIFY, GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC, or
         KEY_AGREEMENT. Each KMS key can have only one key usage. Using a KMS key for more than 
         one type of operation makes the product of both operations more vulnerable to attack.
                                                                                           267
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Key spec
         Key spec is a property that represents the cryptographic conﬁguration of a key. The meaning of 
         the key spec diﬀers with the key type.
         For KMS keys, the key spec determines whether the KMS key is symmetric or asymmetric. It also 
         determines the type of its key material, and the algorithms it supports.
         The default key spec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, represents a 256-bit symmetric encryption key. For 
         a detailed description of all supported key specs, see Key spec reference.
      Key material origin
         Key material origin is a KMS key property that identiﬁes the source of the key material in the 
         KMS key. You choose the key material origin when you create the KMS key, and you cannot 
         change it. The source of the key material aﬀects the security, durability, availability, latency, and 
         throughput characteristics of the KMS key.
         Each KMS key includes a reference to its key material in its metadata. The key material origin 
         of symmetric encryption KMS keys can vary. You can use key material that AWS KMS generates, 
         key material that is generated in a custom key store, or import your own key material.
         By default, each KMS key has unique key material. However, you can create a set of multi-
         Region keys with the same key material.
         KMS keys can have one of the following key material origin values: AWS_KMS, EXTERNAL
         (imported key material), AWS_CLOUDHSM (KMS key in a AWS CloudHSM key store), or
         EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE (KMS key in an external key store).

      Permissions for creating KMS keys
      To create a KMS key in the console or by using the APIs, you must have the following permission in 
      an IAM policy. Whenever possible, use condition keys to limit the permissions. For example, you can 
      use the kms:KeySpec condition key in an IAM policy to allow principals to create only symmetric 
      encryption keys.
      For an example of an IAM policy for principals who create keys, see Allow a user to create KMS 
      keys.
           Note
           Be cautious when giving principals permission to manage tags and aliases. Changing a tag 
           or alias can allow or deny permission to the customer managed key. For details, see ABAC 
           for AWS KMS.
      • kms:CreateKey is required.
      • kms:CreateAlias is required to create a KMS key in the console where an alias is required for every 
        new KMS key.
      • kms:TagResource is required to add tags while creating the KMS key.
      • iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole is required to create multi-Region primary keys. For details, see
        Control access to multi-Region keys.
      The kms:PutKeyPolicy permission is not required to create the KMS key. The kms:CreateKey
      permission includes permission to set the initial key policy. But you must add this permission to the 
      key policy while creating the KMS key to ensure that you can control access to the KMS key. The 
      alternative is using the BypassLockoutSafetyCheck parameter, which is not recommended.
      KMS keys belong to the AWS account in which they were created. The IAM user who creates a 
      KMS key is not considered to be the key owner and they don't automatically have permission 
      to use or manage the KMS key that they created. Like any other principal, the key creator needs 
      to get permission through a key policy, IAM policy, or grant. However, principals who have the
      Permissions for creating KMS keys                                                     269
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     kms:CreateKey permission can set the initial key policy and give themselves permission to use or 
     manage the key.
     Choosing what type of KMS key to create
     The type of KMS key that you create depends largely on how you plan to use the KMS key, your 
     security requirements, and your authorization requirements. The key type and key usage of a KMS 
     key determine what cryptographic operations the key can perform. Each KMS key has only one key 
     usage. Using a KMS key for more than one type of operation makes the product of all operations 
     more vulnerable to attack.
     To allow principals to create KMS keys only for a particular key usage, use the kms:KeyUsage
     condition key. You can also use the kms:KeyUsage condition key to allow principals to call API 
     operations for a KMS key based on its key usage. For example, you can allow permission to disable 
     a KMS key only if its key usage is SIGN_VERIFY.
     Use the following guidance to determine which type of KMS key you need based on your use case.
     Encrypt and decrypt data
       Use a symmetric KMS key for most use cases that require encrypting and decrypting data. 
       The symmetric encryption algorithm that AWS KMS uses is fast, eﬃcient, and assures the 
       conﬁdentiality and authenticity of data. It supports authenticated encryption with additional 
       authenticated data (AAD), deﬁned as an encryption context. This type of KMS key requires both 
       the sender and recipient of encrypted data to have valid AWS credentials to call AWS KMS.
       If your use case requires encryption outside of AWS by users who cannot call AWS KMS,
       asymmetric KMS keys are a good choice. You can distribute the public key of the asymmetric 
       KMS key to allow these users to encrypt data. And your applications that need to decrypt that 
       data can use the private key of the asymmetric KMS key within AWS KMS.
     Sign messages and verify signatures
       To sign messages and verify signatures, you must use an asymmetric KMS key. You can use a 
       KMS key with a key spec that represents an RSA key pair, an elliptic curve (ECC) key pair, an ML-
       DSA key pair, or an SM2 key pair (China Regions only). The key spec you choose is determined 
       by the signing algorithm that you want to use. The ECDSA signing algorithms that ECC key 
       pairs support are recommended over the RSA signing algorithms. Use an ML-DSA key pair 
       when migrating from RSA or ECC keys to post-quantum keys. However, you might need to use

      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
         a particular key spec and signing algorithm to support users who verify signatures outside of 
         AWS.
      Encrypt with asymmetric key pairs
         To encrypt data with an asymmetric key pair, you must use an asymmetric KMS key with an RSA 
         key spec or an SM2 key spec (China Regions only). To encrypt data in AWS KMS with the public 
         key of a KMS key pair, use the Encrypt operation. You can also download the public key and 
         share it with the parties that need to encrypt data outside of AWS KMS.
         When you download the public key of an asymmetric KMS key, you can use it outside of AWS 
         KMS. But it is no longer subject to the security controls that protect the KMS key in AWS KMS. 
         For example, you cannot use AWS KMS key policies or grants to control use of the public key. 
         Nor can you control whether the key is used only for encryption and decryption using the 
         encryption algorithms that AWS KMS supports. For more details, see Special Considerations for 
         Downloading Public Keys.
         To decrypt data that was encrypted with the public key outside of AWS KMS, call the Decrypt
         operation. The Decrypt operation fails if the data was encrypted under a public key from 
         a KMS key with a key usage of SIGN_VERIFY. It will also fail if it was encrypted by using an 
         algorithm that AWS KMS does not support for the key spec you selected. For more information 
         on key specs and supported algorithms, see Key spec reference.
         To avoid these errors, anyone using a public key outside of AWS KMS must store the key 
         conﬁguration. The AWS KMS console and the GetPublicKey response provide the information 
         that you must include when you share the public key.
      Derive shared secrets
         To derive shared secrets, use a KMS key with NIST-recommended elliptic curve or SM2 (China 
         Regions only) key material. AWS KMS uses the Elliptic Curve Cryptography Cofactor Diﬃe-
         Hellman Primitive (ECDH) to establish a key agreement between two peers by deriving a shared 
         secret from their elliptic curve public-private key pairs. You can use the raw shared secret 
         that the  DeriveSharedSecret operation returns to derive a symmetric key that can encrypt 
         and decrypt data that is sent between two parties, or generate and verify HMACs. AWS KMS 
         recommends that you follow NIST recommendations for key derivation when using the raw 
         shared secret to derive a symmetric key.
      Generate and verify HMAC codes
         To generate and verify hash-based message authentication codes, use an HMAC KMS key. When 
         you create an HMAC key in AWS KMS, AWS KMS creates and protects your key material and 
      Choosing what type of KMS key to create                                               271
     AWS Key Management Service                                        Developer Guide
        ensures that you use the correct MAC algorithms for your key. HMAC codes can also be used as 
        pseudo-random numbers, and in certain scenarios for symmetric signing and tokenizing.
        HMAC KMS keys are symmetric keys. When creating an HMAC KMS key in the AWS KMS console, 
        choose the Symmetric key type.
     Use with AWS services
        To create a KMS key for use with an AWS service that is integrated with AWS KMS, consult 
        the documentation for the service. AWS services that encrypt your data require a symmetric 
        encryption KMS key.
     In addition to these considerations, cryptographic operations on KMS keys with diﬀerent key specs 
     have diﬀerent prices and diﬀerent request quotas. For information about AWS KMS pricing, see
     AWS Key Management Service Pricing. For information about request quotas, see Request quotas.
     Create a symmetric encryption KMS key
     This topic explains how to create the basic KMS key, a symmetric encryption KMS key for a single 
     Region with key material from AWS KMS. You can use this KMS key to protect your resources in an 
     AWS service.
     You can create symmetric encryption KMS keys in the AWS KMS console, by using the CreateKey
     API, or by using the AWS::KMS::Key AWS CloudFormation template.
     The default key spec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, is the key spec for symmetric encryption KMS keys. 
     When you select the Symmetric key type and the Encrypt and decrypt key usage in the AWS KMS 
     console, it selects the SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT key spec. In the CreateKey operation, if you don't 
     specify a KeySpec value, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT is selected. If you don't have a reason to use a 
     diﬀerent key spec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT is a good choice.
     For information about quotas that apply to KMS keys, see Quotas.
     Using the AWS KMS console
     You can use the AWS Management Console to create AWS KMS keys (KMS keys).

           Important
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in the alias, description, or tags. These 
           ﬁelds may appear in plain text in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
      4.  Choose Create key.
      5.  To create a symmetric encryption KMS key, for Key type choose Symmetric.
      6.  In Key usage, the Encrypt and decrypt option is selected for you.
      7.  Choose Next.
      8.
          Type an alias for the KMS key. The alias name cannot begin with aws/. The aws/ preﬁx is 
          reserved by Amazon Web Services to represent AWS managed keys in your account.
               Note
               Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For 
               details, see ABAC for AWS KMS and Use aliases to control access to KMS keys.
          An alias is a display name that you can use to identify the KMS key. We recommend that you 
          choose an alias that indicates the type of data you plan to protect or the application you plan 
          to use with the KMS key.
          Aliases are required when you create a KMS key in the AWS Management Console. They are 
          optional when you use the CreateKey operation.
      9.  (Optional) Type a description for the KMS key.
          You can add a description now or update it any time unless the key state is Pending 
          Deletion or Pending Replica Deletion. To add, change, or delete the description of an 
          existing customer managed key, edit the description on the details page for the KMS key in the 
          AWS Management Console or use the UpdateKeyDescription operation.

      10. (Optional) Type a tag key and an optional tag value. To add more than one tag to the KMS key, 
          choose Add tag.
               Note
               Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For 
               details, see ABAC for AWS KMS and Use tags to control access to KMS keys.
          When you add tags to your AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report with 
          usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For 
          information about tagging KMS keys, see Tags in AWS KMS and ABAC for AWS KMS.
      11. Choose Next.
      12. Select the IAM users and roles that can administer the KMS key.
               Notes
               This key policy gives the AWS account full control of this KMS key. It allows account 
               administrators to use IAM policies to give other principals permission to manage the 
               KMS key. For details, see the section called “Default key policy”.
               IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. 
               Whenever possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, see
               Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
               The AWS KMS console adds key administrators to the key policy under the statement 
               identiﬁer "Allow access for Key Administrators". Modifying this statement 
               identiﬁer might impact how the console displays updates that you make to the 
               statement.
      13. (Optional) To prevent the selected IAM users and roles from deleting this KMS key, in the Key 
          deletion section at the bottom of the page, clear the Allow key administrators to delete this 
          key check box.

               The AWS KMS console adds key users to the key policy under the statement 
               identiﬁers "Allow use of the key" and "Allow attachment of persistent 
               resources". Modifying these statement identiﬁers might impact how the console 
               displays updates that you make to the statement.
      16. (Optional) You can allow other AWS accounts to use this KMS key for cryptographic operations. 
          To do so, in the Other AWS accounts section at the bottom of the page, choose Add another 
          AWS account and enter the AWS account identiﬁcation number of an external account. To add 
          multiple external accounts, repeat this step.
               Note
               To allow principals in the external accounts to use the KMS key, Administrators of the 
               external account must create IAM policies that provide these permissions. For more 
               information, see Allowing users in other accounts to use a KMS key.
      17. Choose Next.
      18. Review the key policy statements for the key. To make changes to the key policy, select Edit.
      19. Choose Next.
      20. Review the key settings that you chose. You can still go back and change all settings.
      21. Choose Finish to create the KMS key.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      You can use the CreateKey operation to create AWS KMS keys of all types. These examples use the
      AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For examples in multiple programming languages, see
      Use CreateKey with an AWS SDK or CLI.

           These ﬁelds may appear in plain text in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      The following operation creates a symmetric encryption key in a single Region backed by key 
      material generated by AWS KMS. This operation has no required parameters. However, you might 
      also want to use the Policy parameter to specify a key policy. You can change the key policy 
      (PutKeyPolicy) and add optional elements, such as a description and tags at any time. You can also 
      create asymmetric keys, multi-Region keys, keys with imported key material, and keys in custom 
      key stores. To create data keys for client-side encryption, use the GenerateDataKey operation.
      The CreateKey operation doesn't let you specify an alias, but you can use the CreateAlias
      operation to create an alias for your new KMS key.
      The following is an example of a call to the CreateKey operation with no parameters. This 
      command uses all of the default values. It creates a symmetric encryption KMS key with key 
      material generated by AWS KMS.

        }
      If you do not specify a key policy for your new KMS key, the default key policy that CreateKey
      applies diﬀers from the default key policy that the console applies when you use it to create a new 
      KMS key.
      For example, this call to the GetKeyPolicy operation returns the key policy that CreateKey applies. 
      It gives the AWS account access to the KMS key and allows it to create AWS Identity and Access 
      Management (IAM) policies for the KMS key. For detailed information about IAM policies and key 
      policies for KMS keys, see KMS key access and permissions
        $ aws kms get-key-policy --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab --policy-name

            "Resource" : "*" 
          } ]
        }
      Create an asymmetric KMS key
      You can create asymmetric KMS keys in the AWS KMS console, by using the CreateKey API, or by 
      using the AWS::KMS::Key AWS CloudFormation template. An asymmetric KMS key represents a 
      public and private key pair that can be used for encryption, signing, or deriving shared secrets. The 
      private key remains within AWS KMS. To download the public key for use outside of AWS KMS, see
      Download public key.
      When you create an asymmetric KMS key, you must select a key spec. Often the key spec that you 
      select is determined by regulatory, security, or business requirements. It might also be inﬂuenced 
      by the size of messages that you need to encrypt or sign. In general, longer encryption keys are 
      more resistant to brute-force attacks. For a detailed description of all supported key specs, see Key 
      spec reference.

      AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS do not support asymmetric KMS keys. If you want 
      to create a KMS key that encrypts data that you store or manage in an AWS service, create a 
      symmetric encryption KMS key.
      For information about the permissions required to create KMS keys, see Permissions for creating 
      KMS keys.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      You can use the AWS Management Console to create asymmetric AWS KMS keys (KMS keys). Each 
      asymmetric KMS key represents a public and private key pair.
           Important
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in the alias, description, or tags. These 
           ﬁelds may appear in plain text in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.

          An alias is a friendly name that you can use to identify the KMS key in the console and in some 
          AWS KMS APIs. We recommend that you choose an alias that indicates the type of data you 
          plan to protect or the application you plan to use with the KMS key.
          Aliases are required when you create a KMS key in the AWS Management Console. You cannot 
          specify an alias when you use the CreateKey operation, but you can use the console or the
          CreateAlias operation to create an alias for an existing KMS key. For details, see Aliases in AWS 
          KMS.
      10. (Optional) Type a description for the KMS key.
          Enter a description that explains the type of data you plan to protect or the application you 
          plan to use with the KMS key.
          You can add a description now or update it any time unless the key state is Pending 
          Deletion or Pending Replica Deletion. To add, change, or delete the description of an 
          existing customer managed key, edit the description on the details page for the KMS key in the 
          AWS Management Console or use the UpdateKeyDescription operation.
      11. (Optional) Type a tag key and an optional tag value. To add more than one tag to the KMS key, 
          choose Add tag.
          When you add tags to your AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report with 
          usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For 
          information about tagging KMS keys, see Tags in AWS KMS and ABAC for AWS KMS.

      When you create an asymmetric KMS key, you must specify the KeySpec parameter, 
      which determines the type of keys you create. Also, you must specify a KeyUsage value of 
      ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, SIGN_VERIFY, or KEY_AGREEMENT. You cannot change these properties after 
      the KMS key is created.
      The CreateKey operation doesn't let you specify an alias, but you can use the CreateAlias
      operation to create an alias for your new KMS key.
           Important
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in the Description or Tags ﬁelds. 
           These ﬁelds may appear in plain text in CloudTrail logs and other output.

      Create an HMAC KMS key
      You can create HMAC KMS keys in the AWS KMS console, by using the CreateKey API, or by using 
      the AWS::KMS::Key AWS CloudFormation template.
      When you create an HMAC KMS key, you must select a key spec. AWS KMS supports multiple
      key specs for HMAC KMS keys. The key spec that you select might be determined by regulatory, 
      security, or business requirements. In general, longer keys are more resistant to brute-force attacks.
      For information about the permissions required to create KMS keys, see Permissions for creating 
      KMS keys.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      You can use the AWS Management Console to create HMAC KMS keys. HMAC KMS keys are 
      symmetric keys with a key usage of Generate and verify MAC. You can also create multi-Region 
      HMAC keys.
      Create an HMAC KMS key                                                                  283
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
      4.  Choose Create key.
      5.  For Key type, choose Symmetric.
          HMAC KMS keys are symmetric. You use the same key to generate and verify HMAC tags.
      6.  For Key usage, choose Generate and verify MAC.
          Generate and verify MAC is the only valid key usage for HMAC KMS keys.
               Note
               Key usage is displayed for symmetric keys only when HMAC KMS keys are supported in 
               your selected Region.
      7.  Select a speciﬁcation (Key spec) for your HMAC KMS key.
          The key spec that you select can be determined by regulatory, security, or business 
          requirements. In general, longer keys are more secure.
      8.  To create a multi-Region primary HMAC key, in Advanced options, choose Multi-Region key. 
          The shared properties that you deﬁne for this KMS key, such as its key type and key usage, will 
          be shared with its replica keys.
          You cannot use this procedure to create a replica key. To create a multi-Region replica HMAC 
          key, follow the instructions for creating a replica key.
      9.  Choose Next.
      10.
          Enter an alias for the KMS key. The alias name cannot begin with aws/. The aws/ preﬁx is 
          reserved by Amazon Web Services to represent AWS managed keys in your account.
          We recommend that you use an alias that identiﬁes the KMS key as an HMAC key, such as
          HMAC/test-key. This will make it easier for you to identify your HMAC keys in the AWS KMS 
          console where you can sort and ﬁlter keys by tags and aliases, but not by key spec or key 
          usage.
      Create an HMAC KMS key                                                                  284

          Aliases are required when you create a KMS key in the AWS Management Console. You cannot 
          specify an alias when you use the CreateKey operation, but you can use the console or the
          CreateAlias operation to create an alias for an existing KMS key. For details, see Aliases in AWS 
          KMS.
      11. (Optional) Enter a description for the KMS key.
          Enter a description that explains the type of data you plan to protect or the application you 
          plan to use with the KMS key.
          You can add a description now or update it any time unless the key state is Pending 
          Deletion or Pending Replica Deletion. To add, change, or delete the description of an 
          existing customer managed key, edit the description on the details page for the KMS key in the 
          AWS Management Console in the AWS Management Console or use the UpdateKeyDescription
          operation.
      12. (Optional) Enter a tag key and an optional tag value. To add more than one tag to the KMS 
          key, choose Add tag.
          Consider adding a tag that identiﬁes the key as an HMAC key, such as Type=HMAC. This will 
          make it easier for you to identify your HMAC keys in the AWS KMS console where you can sort 
          and ﬁlter keys by tags and aliases, but not by key spec or key usage.
          When you add tags to your AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report with 
          usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For 
          information about tagging KMS keys, see Tags in AWS KMS and ABAC for AWS KMS.
      13. Choose Next.
      14. Select the IAM users and roles that can administer the KMS key.
               Notes
               This key policy gives the AWS account full control of this KMS key. It allows account 
               administrators to use IAM policies to give other principals permission to manage the 
               KMS key. For details, see the section called “Default key policy”.
               IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. 
               Whenever possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, see
               Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
               The AWS KMS console adds key administrators to the key policy under the statement 
               identiﬁer "Allow access for Key Administrators". Modifying this statement

               identiﬁer might impact how the console displays updates that you make to the 
               statement.
      15. (Optional) To prevent the selected IAM users and roles from deleting this KMS key, in the Key 
          deletion section at the bottom of the page, clear the Allow key administrators to delete this 
          key check box.
      16. Choose Next.
      17. Select the IAM users and roles that can use the KMS key for cryptographic operations.
               Notes
               IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. 
               Whenever possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, see
               Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
               The AWS KMS console adds key users to the key policy under the statement 
               identiﬁers "Allow use of the key" and "Allow attachment of persistent 
               resources". Modifying these statement identiﬁers might impact how the console 
               displays updates that you make to the statement.
      18. (Optional) You can allow other AWS accounts to use this KMS key for cryptographic operations. 
          To do so, in the Other AWS accounts section at the bottom of the page, choose Add another 
          AWS account and enter the AWS account identiﬁcation number of an external account. To add 
          multiple external accounts, repeat this step.
               Note
               To allow principals in the external accounts to use the KMS key, Administrators of the 
               external account must create IAM policies that provide these permissions. For more 
               information, see Allowing users in other accounts to use a KMS key.
      19. Choose Next.
      20. Review the key policy statements for the key. To make changes to the key policy, select Edit.
      21. Choose Next.
      22. Review the key settings that you chose. You can still go back and change all settings.
      23. Choose Finish to create the HMAC KMS key.
      Create an HMAC KMS key                                                                  286

      Using the AWS KMS API
      You can use the CreateKey operation to create an HMAC KMS key. These examples use the AWS 
      Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any supported programming language.
      When you create an HMAC KMS key, you must specify the KeySpec parameter, which determines 
      the type of the KMS key. Also, you must specify a KeyUsage value of GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC, 
      even though it's the only valid key usage value for HMAC keys. To create a multi-Region HMAC KMS 
      key, add the MultiRegion parameter with a value of true. You cannot change these properties 
      after the KMS key is created.
      The CreateKey operation doesn't let you specify an alias, but you can use the CreateAlias
      operation to create an alias for your new KMS key. We recommend that you use an alias that 
      identiﬁes the KMS key as an HMAC key, such as HMAC/test-key. This will make it easier for you 
      to identify your HMAC keys in the AWS KMS console where you can sort and ﬁlter keys by alias, but 
      not by key spec or key usage.
      If you try to create an HMAC KMS key in an AWS Region in which HMAC keys are not supported, the
      CreateKey operation returns an UnsupportedOperationException
      The following example uses the CreateKey operation to create a 512-bit HMAC KMS key.
        $ aws kms create-key --key-spec HMAC_512 --key-usage GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC

      Create multi-Region primary keys
      You can create a multi-Region primary key in the AWS KMS console or by using the AWS KMS API. 
      You can create the primary key in any AWS Region where AWS KMS supports multi-Region keys.
      To create a multi-Region primary key, the principal needs the same permissions that they need to 
      create any KMS key, including the kms:CreateKey permission in an IAM policy. The principal also 
      needs the iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission. You can use the kms:MultiRegionKeyType
      condition key to allow or deny permission to create multi-Region primary keys.
           Note
           When creating your multi-Region primary key, carefully consider the IAM users and roles 
           that you select to administer and use the key. IAM policies can give other IAM users and 
           roles permission to manage the KMS key.
           IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. Whenever 
           possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, see Security best 
           practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      To create a multi-Region primary key in the AWS KMS console, use the same process that you 
      would use to create any KMS key.. You select a multi-Region key in Advanced options. For 
      complete instructions, see Create a KMS key.
           Important
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in the alias, description, or tags. These 
           ﬁelds may appear in plain text in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.

      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
      4.  Choose Create key.
      5.  Select a symmetric or asymmetric key type. Symmetric keys are the default.
          You can create multi-Region symmetric and asymmetric keys, including multi-Region HMAC 
          KMS keys, which are symmetric.
      6.  Select your key usage. Encrypt and decrypt is the default.
          For help, see Create a KMS key, the section called “Create an asymmetric KMS key”, or the 
          section called “Create an HMAC KMS key”.
      7.  Expand Advanced options.
      8.  Under Key material origin, to have AWS KMS generate the key material that your primary and 
          replica keys will share, choose KMS. If you are importing key material into the primary and 
          replica keys, choose External (Import key material).
      9.  Under Regionality, choose Multi-Region key.
          You can't change this setting after you create the KMS key.
      10. Type an alias for the primary key.
          Aliases are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can give your multi-Region primary 
          key and its replicas the same alias or diﬀerent aliases. AWS KMS does not synchronize the 
          aliases of multi-Region keys.
               Note
               Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For 
               details, see ABAC for AWS KMS and Use aliases to control access to KMS keys.
      11. (Optional) Type a description of the primary key.
          Descriptions are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can give your multi-Region 
          primary key and its replicas the same description or diﬀerent descriptions. AWS KMS does not 
          synchronize the key descriptions of multi-Region keys.
      12. (Optional) Type a tag key and an optional tag value. To assign more than one tag to the 
          primary key, choose Add tag.
      Create multi-Region primary keys                                                      289

          Tags are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can give your multi-Region primary 
          key and its replicas the same tags or diﬀerent tags. AWS KMS does not synchronize the tags of 
          multi-Region keys. You can change the tags on KMS keys at any time.
               Note
               Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For 
               details, see ABAC for AWS KMS and Use tags to control access to KMS keys.
      13. Select the IAM users and roles that can administer the primary key.
               Notes
               • This step starts the process of creating a key policy for the primary key. Key policies 
                 are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can give your multi-Region 
                 primary key and its replicas the same key policy or diﬀerent key policies. AWS KMS 
                 does not synchronize the key policies of multi-Region keys. You can change the key 
                 policy of a KMS key at any time.
               • When creating a multi-Region primary key, consider using the default key policy
                 generated by the console. If you modify this policy, the console won't provide steps 
                 to select key administrators and users when creating replica keys, nor will it add the 
                 corresponding policy statements. As a result, you'll need to add these manually.
               • The AWS KMS console adds key administrators to the key policy under the statement 
                 identiﬁer "Allow access for Key Administrators". Modifying this 
                 statement identiﬁer might impact how the console displays updates that you make

               Note
               To allow principals in the external accounts to use the KMS key, Administrators of the 
               external account must create IAM policies that provide these permissions. For more

      Using the AWS KMS API
      To create a multi-Region primary key, use the CreateKey operation. Use the MultiRegion
      parameter with a value of True.
      For example, the following command creates a multi-Region primary key in the caller's AWS Region 
      (us-east-1). It accepts default values for all other properties, including the key policy. The default 
      values for multi-Region primary keys are the same as the default values for all other KMS keys, 
      including the default key policy. This procedure creates a symmetric encryption key, the default 
      KMS key.

      Create multi-Region replica keys
      You can create a multi-Region replica key in the AWS KMS console, by using the ReplicateKey
      operation, or by using a AWS::KMS::ReplicaKey AWS CloudFormation template. You cannot use the
      CreateKey operation to create a replica key.
      You can use these procedures to replicate any multi-Region primary key, including a symmetric 
      encryption KMS key, an asymmetric KMS key, or an HMAC KMS key.
      When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state of Creating. 
      This key state changes to Enabled (or PendingImport if you create a multi-Region key with
      imported key material) after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica key is 
      complete. While the key state is Creating, you can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in 
      cryptographic operations. If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry on
      KMSInvalidStateException or call DescribeKey to check its KeyState value before using it.
      If you mistakenly delete a replica key, you can use this procedure to recreate it. If you replicate the 
      same primary key in the same Region, the new replica key you create will have the same shared 
      properties as the original replica key.
           Important
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in the alias, description, or tags. These 
           ﬁelds may appear in plain text in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      To use a AWS CloudFormation template to create a replica key, see AWS::KMS::ReplicaKey in the
      AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
      Step 1: Choose replica Regions
      You typically choose to replicate a multi-Region key into an AWS Region based on your business 
      model and regulatory requirements. For example, you might replicate a key into Regions where you 
      keep your resources. Or, to comply with a disaster recovery requirement, you might replicate a key 
      into geographically distant Regions.
      The following are the AWS KMS requirements for replica Regions. If the Region that you choose 
      doesn't comply with these requirements, attempts to replicate a key fail.
      Create multi-Region replica keys                                                  293
      AWS Key Management Service                                                   Developer Guide
      • One related multi-Region key per Region — You can't create a replica key in the same Region as 
        its primary key, or in the same Region as another replica of the primary key.
        If you try to replicate a primary key in a Region that already has a replica of that primary key, the 
        attempt fails. If the current replica key in the Region is in the PendingDeletion key state, you 
        can cancel the replica key deletion or wait until the replica key is deleted.
      • Multiple unrelated multi-Region keys in the same Region — You can have multiple unrelated 
        multi-Region keys in the same Region. For example, you can have two multi-Region primary keys 
        in the us-east-1 Region. Each of the primary keys can have a replica key in us-west-2 Region.
      • Regions in the same partition — The replica key Region must be in the same AWS partition as 
        the primary key Region.
      • Region must be enabled — If a Region is disabled by default, you cannot create any resources in 
        that Region until it is enabled for your AWS account.
      Step 2: Create replica keys
           Note
           When creating replica keys, carefully consider the IAM users and roles that you select 
           to administer and use the replica key. IAM policies can give other IAM users and roles 
           permission to manage the KMS key.
           IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. Whenever 
           possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, see Security best 
           practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      In the AWS KMS console, you can create one or many replicas of a multi-Region primary key in the 
      same operation.
      This procedure is similar to creating a standard single-Region KMS key in the console. However, 
      because a replica key is based on the primary key, you do not select values for shared properties, 
      such as the key spec (symmetric or asymmetric), key usage, or key origin.
      You do specify properties that are not shared, including an alias, tags, a description, and a key 
      policy. As a convenience, the console displays the current property values of the primary key, but 
      Step 2: Create replica keys                                                         294

      you can change them. Even if you keep the primary key values, AWS KMS does not keep these 
      values synchronized.
           Important
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in the alias, description, or tags. These 
           ﬁelds may appear in plain text in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
      4.  Select the key ID or alias of a multi-Region primary key. This opens the key details page for the 
          KMS key.
          To identify a multi-Region primary key, use the tool icon in the upper right corner to add the
          Regionality column to the table.
      5.  Choose the Regionality tab.
      6.  In the Related multi-Region keys section, choose Create new replica keys.
          The Related multi-Region keys section displays the Region of the primary key and its replica 
          keys. You can use this display to help you choose the Region for your new replica key.
      7.  Choose one or more AWS Regions. This procedure creates a replica key in each of the Regions 
          you select.
          The menu includes only Regions in the same AWS partition as the primary key. Regions that 
          already have a related multi-Region key are displayed, but not selectable. You might not have 
          permission to replicate a key into all of the Regions on the menu.
          When you are ﬁnished choosing Regions, close the menu. The Regions you chose are displayed. 
          To cancel replication into a Region, choose the X beside the Region name.
      8.  Type an alias for the replica key.
          The console displays one of the current aliases of the primary key, but you can change it. You 
          can give your multi-Region primary key and its replicas the same alias or diﬀerent aliases. 
      Step 2: Create replica keys                                                             295
      AWS Key Management Service                                                 Developer Guide
          Aliases are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. AWS KMS does not synchronize the 
          aliases of multi-Region keys.
          Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For details, 
          see ABAC for AWS KMS and Use aliases to control access to KMS keys.
      9.  (Optional) Type a description of the replica key.
          The console displays the current description of the primary key, but you can change it. 
          Descriptions are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can give your multi-Region 
          primary key and its replicas the same description or diﬀerent descriptions. AWS KMS does not 
          synchronize the key descriptions of multi-Region keys.
      10. (Optional) Type a tag key and an optional tag value. To assign more than one tag to the replica 
          key, choose Add tag.
          The console displays the tags currently attached to the primary key, but you can change them. 
          Tags are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can give your multi-Region primary 
          key and its replicas the same tags or diﬀerent tags. AWS KMS does not synchronize the tags of 
          multi-Region keys.
          Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For details, see
          ABAC for AWS KMS and Use tags to control access to KMS keys.
      11. Select the IAM users and roles that can administer the replica key.
              Notes
              • If you modiﬁed the default key policy when creating your multi-Region primary key, 
                the console won't prompt you to select key administrators or key users (steps 11-15) 
                during replica key creation. In this case, you'll need to manually add the necessary 
                permissions for key administrators and users to the key policy by selecting Edit in 
                the Edit key policy step (Step 17).
              • This step begins the process of creating a key policy for the replica key. The console 
                displays the current key policy of the primary key, but you can change it. Key policies 
                are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can give your multi-Region 
                primary key and its replicas the same key policy or diﬀerent key policies. AWS KMS 
                does not synchronize key policies. You can change the key policy of any KMS key at 
                any time.

      Using the AWS KMS API
      To create a multi-Region replica key, use the ReplicateKey operation. You cannot use the CreateKey
      operation to create a replica key. This operation creates one replica key at a time. The Region that 
      you specify must comply with the Region requirements for replica keys.
      When you use the ReplicateKey operation, you don't specify values for any shared properties of 
      multi-Region keys. Shared property values are copied from the primary key and kept synchronized. 
      However, you can specify values for properties that are not shared. Otherwise, AWS KMS applies 
      the standard default values for KMS keys, not the values of the primary key.
           Note
           If you don't specify values for the Description, KeyPolicy, or Tags parameters, AWS 
           KMS creates the replica key with an empty string description, the default key policy, and no 
           tags.
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in the Description or Tags ﬁelds. 
           These ﬁelds may appear in plain text in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      For example, the following command creates a multi-Region replica key in the Asia Paciﬁc (Sydney) 
      Region (ap-southeast-2). This replica key is modeled on the primary key in the US East (N. Virginia) 
      Region (us-east-1), which is identiﬁed by the value of the KeyId parameter. This example accepts 
      default values for all other properties, including the key policy.
      The response describes the new replica key. It includes ﬁelds for shared properties, such as the
      KeyId, KeySpec, KeyUsage, and key material origin (Origin). It also includes properties that are 
      independent of the primary key, such as the Description, key policy (ReplicaKeyPolicy), and 
      tags (ReplicaTags).
      The response also includes the key ARN and region of the primary key and all of its replica 
      keys, including the one that was just created in the ap-southeast-2 Region. In this example, the
      ReplicaKey element shows that this primary key was already replicated in the Europe (Ireland) 
      Region (eu-west-1).

      Create a KMS key with imported key material
      Imported key material lets you protect your AWS resources under cryptographic keys that you 
      generate. The following overview explains how to import your key material into AWS KMS. For 
      more details about each step in the process, see the corresponding topics.
      1.
         Create a KMS key with no key material – The origin must be EXTERNAL. A key origin of
         EXTERNAL indicates that the key is designed for imported key material and prevents AWS KMS 
         from generating key material for the KMS key. In a later step you will import your own key 
         material into this KMS key.
         The key material that you import must be compatible with the key spec of the associated AWS 
         KMS key. For more information about compatibility, see the section called “Requirements for 
         imported key material”.
      2. Download the wrapping public key and import token – After completing step 1, download 
         a wrapping public key and an import token. These items protect your key material while it's 
         imported to AWS KMS.
         In this step, you choose the type ("key spec") of the RSA wrapping key and the wrapping 
         algorithm that you'll use to encrypt your data in transit to AWS KMS. You can choose a diﬀerent 
         wrapping key spec and wrapping key algorithm each time you import or reimport the same key 
         material.
      3. Encrypt the key material – Use the wrapping public key that you downloaded in step 2 to 
         encrypt the key material that you created on your own system.
      4. Import the key material – Upload the encrypted key material that you created in step 3 and the 
         import token that you downloaded in step 2.
         At this stage, you can set an optional expiration time. When imported key material expires, AWS 
         KMS deletes it, and the KMS key becomes unusable. To continue to use the KMS key, you must 
         reimport the same key material.
         When the import operation completes successfully, the key state of the KMS key changes from
         PendingImport to Enabled. You can now use the KMS key in cryptographic operations.
      AWS KMS records an entry in your AWS CloudTrail log when you create the KMS key, download 
      the wrapping public key and import token, and import the key material. AWS KMS also records an 
      entry when you delete imported key material or when AWS KMS deletes expired key material.

      Permissions for importing key material
      To create and manage KMS keys with imported key material, the user needs permission 
      for the operations in this process. You can provide the kms:GetParametersForImport,
      kms:ImportKeyMaterial, and kms:DeleteImportedKeyMaterial permissions in the key 
      policy when you create the KMS key. In the AWS KMS console, these permissions are added 
      automatically for key administrators when you create a key with an External key material origin.
      To create KMS keys with imported key material, the principal needs the following permissions.
      • kms:CreateKey (IAM policy)
        • To limit this permission to KMS keys with imported key material, use the kms:KeyOrigin policy 
          condition with a value of EXTERNAL.
            { 
              "Sid": "CreateKMSKeysWithoutKeyMaterial", 
              "Effect": "Allow", 
              "Resource": "*", 
              "Action": "kms:CreateKey", 
              "Condition": { 
                "StringEquals": { 
                  "kms:KeyOrigin": "EXTERNAL" 
                } 
              }
            }
      • kms:GetParametersForImport (Key policy or IAM policy)
        • To limit this permission to requests that use a particular wrapping algorithm and wrapping key 
          spec, use the kms:WrappingAlgorithm and kms:WrappingKeySpec policy conditions.
      • kms:ImportKeyMaterial (Key policy or IAM policy)
        • To allow or prohibit key material that expires and control the expiration date, use the
          kms:ExpirationModel and kms:ValidTo policy conditions.
      To reimport imported key material, the principal needs the kms:GetParametersForImport and
      kms:ImportKeyMaterial permissions.
      To delete imported key material, the principal needs kms:DeleteImportedKeyMaterial permission.
      Permissions for importing key material                                                  301

      For example, to give the example KMSAdminRole permission to manage all aspects of a KMS key 
      with imported key material, include a key policy statement like the following one in the key policy 
      of the KMS key.
        { 
          "Sid": "Manage KMS keys with imported key material", 
          "Effect": "Allow", 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/KMSAdminRole" 
          }, 
          "Action": [ 
            "kms:GetParametersForImport", 
            "kms:ImportKeyMaterial", 
            "kms:DeleteImportedKeyMaterial" 
          ]   
        }
      Requirements for imported key material
      The key material that you import must be compatible with the key spec of the associated KMS key. 
      For asymmetric key pairs, import only the private key of the pair. AWS KMS derives the public key 
      from the private key.
      AWS KMS supports the following key specs for KMS keys with imported key material.

      Step 1: Create an AWS KMS key without key material
      By default, AWS KMS creates key material for you when you create a KMS key. To import your 
      own key material instead, start by creating a KMS key with no key material. Then import the 
      key material. To create a KMS key with no key material, use AWS KMS console or the CreateKey
      operation.
      To create a key with no key material, specify an origin of EXTERNAL. The origin property of a KMS 
      key is immutable. Once you create it, you cannot convert a KMS key designed for imported key 
      material into a KMS key with key material from AWS KMS or any other source.

      AWS Key Management Service                                             Developer Guide
      The key state of a KMS key with an EXTERNAL origin and no key material is PendingImport. A 
      KMS key can remain in PendingImport state indeﬁnitely. However, you cannot use a KMS key in
      PendingImport state in cryptographic operations. When you import key material, the key state of 
      the KMS key changes to Enabled, and you can use it in cryptographic operations.
      AWS KMS records an event in your AWS CloudTrail log when you create the KMS key, download the 
      public key and import token, and import the key material. AWS KMS also records a CloudTrail event 
      when you delete imported key material or when AWS KMS deletes expired key material.

      Creating a KMS key with no key material (console)
      You only need to create a KMS key for the imported key material once. You can import and 
      reimport the same key material into the existing KMS key as often as you need to, but you cannot 
      import diﬀerent key material into a KMS key. For details, see Step 2: Download the wrapping public 
      key and import token.
      To ﬁnd existing KMS keys with imported key material in your Customer managed keys table, use 
      the gear icon in the upper right corner to show the Origin column in the list of KMS keys. Imported 
      keys have an Origin value of External (Import Key material).
      To create a KMS key with imported key material, begin by following the instructions for creating a 
      KMS key of your preferred key type, with the following exception.
      After choosing the key usage, do the following:
      1. Expand Advanced options.
      2. For Key material origin, choose External (Import key material).
      3. Choose the check box next to I understand the security and durability implications of using an 
        imported key to indicate that you understand the implications of using imported key material. 
        To read about these implications, see Protecting imported key material.
      4. Optional: To create a multi-Region KMS key with imported key material, under Regionality
        select Multi-Region key.
      5. Return to the basic instructions. The remaining steps of the basic procedure are the same for all 
        KMS keys of that type.

      When you choose Finish, you have created a KMS key with no key material and a status (key state) 
      of Pending import.
      However. instead of returning to the Customer managed keys table, the console displays a page 
      where you can download the public key and import token that you need to import your key 
      material. You can continue with the download step now, or choose Cancel to stop at this point. You 
      can return to this download step at any time.
      Next: Step 2: Download the wrapping public key and import token.
      Creating a KMS key with no key material (AWS KMS API)
      To use the AWS KMS API to create a symmetric encryption KMS key with no key material, send a
      CreateKey request with the Origin parameter set to EXTERNAL. The following example shows 
      how to do this with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
        $ aws kms create-key --origin EXTERNAL
      When the command is successful, you see output similar to the following. The AWS KMS key's
      Origin is EXTERNAL and its KeyState is PendingImport.
           Tip
           If the command does not succeed, you might see a KMSInvalidStateException or a
           NotFoundException. You can retry the request.

      Copy the KeyId value from your command output to use in later steps, and then proceed to Step 
      2: Download the wrapping public key and import token.
           Note
           This command creates a symmetric encryption KMS key with a KeySpec of
           SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT and KeyUsage of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT. You can use the optional 
           parameters --key-spec and --key-usage to create an asymmetric or HMAC KMS key. 
           For more information, see the CreateKey operation.
      Step 2: Download the wrapping public key and import token
      After you create a AWS KMS key with no key material, download a wrapping public key and an 
      import token for that KMS key by using the AWS KMS console or the GetParametersForImport API. 
      The wrapping public key and import token are an indivisible set that must be used together.
      You will use the wrapping public key to encrypt your key material for transport. Before 
      downloading an RSA wrapping key pair, you select the length (key spec) of the RSA wrapping 
      key pair and the wrapping algorithm that you will use to encrypt your imported key material for 
      transport in step 3. AWS KMS also supports the SM2 wrapping key spec (China Regions only).
      Each wrapping public key and import token set is valid for 24 hours. If you don't use them to 
      import key material within 24 hours of downloading them, you must download a new set. You can 
      download new wrapping public key and import token sets at any time. This lets you change your 
      RSA wrapping key length ("key spec") or replace a lost set.
      You can also download a wrapping public key and import token set to reimport the same key 
      material into a KMS key. You might do this to set or change the expiration time for the key 
      Step 2: Download the wrapping public key and import token                               307

      material, or to restore expired or deleted key material. You must download and re-encrypt your key 
      material every time you import it to AWS KMS.
      Use of the wrapping public key
         The download includes a public key that is unique to your AWS account, also called a wrapping 
         public key.
         Before you import key material, you encrypt the key material with the public wrapping key, and 
         then upload the encrypted key material to AWS KMS. When AWS KMS receives your encrypted 
         key material, it decrypts the key material with the corresponding private key, then reencrypts 
         the key material under an AES symmetric key, all within an AWS KMS hardware security module 
         (HSM).
      Use of the import token
         The download includes an import token with metadata that ensures that your key material 
         is imported correctly. When you upload your encrypted key material to AWS KMS, you must 
         upload the same import token that you downloaded in this step.
      Select a wrapping public key spec
      To protect your key material during import, you encrypt it using wrapping public key that you 
      download from AWS KMS, and a supported wrapping algorithm. You select a key spec before you 
      download your wrapping public key and import token. All wrapping key pairs are generated in AWS 
      KMS hardware security modules (HSMs). The private key never leaves the HSM in plain text.
      RSA wrapping key specs
         The key spec of the wrapping public key determines the length of the keys in the RSA key pair 
         that protects your key material during its transport to AWS KMS. In general, we recommend 
         using the longest wrapping public key that is practical. We oﬀer several wrapping public key 
         specs to support a variety of HSMs and key managers.
         AWS KMS supports the following key specs for the RSA wrapping keys used to import key 
         material of all types, except as noted.
         • RSA_4096 (preferred)
         • RSA_3072
         • RSA_2048

                Note
                The following combination is NOT supported: ECC_NIST_P521 key material, 
                the RSA_2048 public wrapping key spec, and an RSAES_OAEP_SHA_* wrapping 
                algorithm.
                You cannot directly wrap ECC_NIST_P521 key material with a RSA_2048 public 
                wrapping key. Use a larger wrapping key or an RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_* wrapping 
                algorithm.
      SM2 wrapping key spec (China Regions only)
         AWS KMS supports the following key spec for the SM2 wrapping keys used to import 
         asymmetric key material.
         • SM2
      Select a wrapping algorithm
      To protect your key material during import, you encrypt it using the downloaded wrapping public 
      key and a supported wrapping algorithm.
      AWS KMS supports several standard RSA wrapping algorithms and a two-step hybrid wrapping 
      algorithm. In general, we recommend using the most secure wrapping algorithm that is compatible 
      with your imported key material and wrapping key spec. Typically, you choose an algorithm that is 
      supported by the hardware security module (HSM) or key management system that protects your 
      key material.
      The following table shows the wrapping algorithms that are supported for each type of key 
      material and KMS key. The algorithms are listed in preference order.

          If you have a Next option, to continue the process now, choose Next. To continue later, choose
          Cancel.
      11.
          Decompress the .zip ﬁle that you saved in the previous step 
          (Import_Parameters_<key_id>_<timestamp>).
          The folder contains the following ﬁles:
          •
            A wrapping public key in a ﬁle named WrappingPublicKey.bin.
          •
            An import token in a ﬁle named ImportToken.bin.
          • A text ﬁle named README.txt. This ﬁle contains information about the wrapping public key, 
            the wrapping algorithm to use to encrypt your key material, and the date and time when the 
            wrapping public key and import token expire.
      12. To continue the process, see encrypt your key material.
      Downloading the wrapping public key and import token (AWS KMS API)
      To download the public key and import token, use the GetParametersForImport API. Specify the 
      KMS key that will be associated with the imported key material. This KMS key must have an Origin
      value of EXTERNAL.
      Step 2: Download the wrapping public key and import token                              314
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
           Note
           You can't import key material for ML-DSA KMS keys.
      This example speciﬁes the RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_256 wrapping algorithm, the RSA_3072 
      wrapping public key spec, and an example key ID. Replace these example values with valid values 
      for your download. For the key ID, you can use a key ID or key ARN, but you cannot use an alias 
      name or alias ARN in this operation.
        $ aws kms get-parameters-for-import \ 
            --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
            --wrapping-algorithm RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_256 \ 
            --wrapping-key-spec RSA_3072
      When the command is successful, you see output similar to the following:
        { 
            "ParametersValidTo": 1568290320.0, 
            "PublicKey": "public key (base64 encoded)", 
            "KeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-
        west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab", 
            "ImportToken": "import token (base64 encoded)"
        }
      To prepare the data for the next step, base64 decode the public key and import token and save the 
      decoded values in ﬁles.
      To base64 decode the public key and import token:
      1.
          Copy the base64 encoded public key (represented by public key (base64 encoded) in 
          the example output), paste it into a new ﬁle, and then save the ﬁle. Give the ﬁle a descriptive 
          name, such as PublicKey.b64.
      2.  Use OpenSSL to base64 decode the ﬁle's contents and save the decoded data to a new 
          ﬁle. The following example decodes the data in the ﬁle that you saved in the previous step 
          (PublicKey.b64) and saves the output to a new ﬁle named WrappingPublicKey.bin.
            $ openssl enc -d -base64 -A -in PublicKey.b64 -out WrappingPublicKey.bin
      Step 2: Download the wrapping public key and import token                               315

      3.
          Copy the base64 encoded import token (represented by import token (base64 encoded)
          in the example output), paste it into a new ﬁle, and then save the ﬁle. Give the ﬁle a 
          descriptive name, for example importtoken.b64.
      4.  Use OpenSSL to base64 decode the ﬁle's contents and save the decoded data to a new 
          ﬁle. The following example decodes the data in the ﬁle that you saved in the previous step 
          (ImportToken.b64) and saves the output to a new ﬁle named ImportToken.bin.
            $ openssl enc -d -base64 -A -in importtoken.b64 -out ImportToken.bin
      Proceed to Step 3: Encrypt the key material.
      Step 3: Encrypt the key material
      After you download the public key and import token, encrypt your key material using the public 
      key that you downloaded and the wrapping algorithm that you speciﬁed. If you need to replace the 
      public key or import token, or change the wrapping algorithm, you must download a new public 
      key and import token. For information about the public keys and wrapping algorithms that AWS 
      KMS supports, see Select a wrapping public key spec and Select a wrapping algorithm.
      The key material must be in binary format. For detailed information, see Requirements for 
      imported key material.
           Note
           For asymmetric key pairs, encrypt and import only the private key. AWS KMS derives the 
           public key from the private key.
           The following combination is NOT supported: ECC_NIST_P521 key material, the RSA_2048 
           public wrapping key spec, and an RSAES_OAEP_SHA_* wrapping algorithm.
           You cannot directly wrap ECC_NIST_P521 key material with a RSA_2048 public wrapping 
           key. Use a larger wrapping key or an RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_* wrapping algorithm.
           The RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_256 and RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_1 wrapping algorithms 
           are not supported in China Regions.
      Typically, you encrypt your key material when you export it from your hardware security module 
      (HSM) or key management system. For information about how to export key material in binary 
      Step 3: Encrypt the key material                                                        316
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      format, see the documentation for your HSM or key management system. You can also refer to the 
      following section that provides a proof of concept demonstration using OpenSSL.
      When you encrypt your key material, use the same wrapping algorithm that you speciﬁed when 
      you downloaded the public key and import token. To ﬁnd the wrapping algorithm that you 
      speciﬁed, see the CloudTrail log event for the associated GetParametersForImport request.
      Generate key material for testing
      The following OpenSSL commands generate key material of each supported type for testing. 
      These examples are provided only for testing and proof-of-concept demonstrations. For production 
      systems, use a more secure method to generate your key material, such as a hardware security 
      module or key management system.
      To convert the private keys of asymmetric key pairs into DER-encoded format, pipe the key 
      material generation command to the following openssl pkcs8 command. The topk8 parameter 
      directs OpenSSL to take a private key as input and return a PKCS#8 formatted key. (The default 
      behavior is the opposite.)
        openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -outform der -nocrypt
      The following commands generate test key material for each of the supported key types.
      • Symmetric encryption key (32 bytes)
        This command generates a 256-bit symmetric key (32-byte random string) and saves it in the
        PlaintextKeyMaterial.bin ﬁle. You do not need to encode this key material.
          openssl rand -out PlaintextKeyMaterial.bin 32
        In China Regions only, you must generate a 128-bit symmetric key (16-byte random string).
          openssl rand -out PlaintextKeyMaterial.bin 16
      • HMAC keys
        This command generates a random byte string of the speciﬁed size. You do not need to encode 
        this key material.
      Step 3: Encrypt the key material                                                        317

        The length of your HMAC key must match the length deﬁned by the key spec of the KMS key. For 
        example, if the KMS key is HMAC_384, you must import a 384-bit (48-byte) key.
          openssl rand -out HMAC_224_PlaintextKey.bin 28
          openssl rand -out HMAC_256_PlaintextKey.bin 32

      Examples of encrypting key material with OpenSSL
      The following examples show how to use OpenSSL to encrypt your key material with the public key 
      that you downloaded. To encrypt your key material using an SM2 public key (China Regions only), 
      use the SM2OfflineOperationHelper class. For more information on the key material types 
      that each wrapping algorithm supports, see the section called “Select a wrapping algorithm”.
           Important
           These examples are a proof of concept demonstration only. For production systems, use a 
           more secure method (such as a commercial HSM or key management system) to generate 
           and store your key material.
           The following combination is NOT supported: ECC_NIST_P521 key material, the RSA_2048 
           public wrapping key spec, and an RSAES_OAEP_SHA_* wrapping algorithm.
           You cannot directly wrap ECC_NIST_P521 key material with a RSA_2048 public wrapping 
           key. Use a larger wrapping key or an RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_* wrapping algorithm.
      RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1
         AWS KMS supports the RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1 for symmetric encryption keys 
         (SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT), elliptic curve (ECC) private keys, SM2 private keys, and HMAC keys.
         RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1 is not supported for RSA private keys. Also, you cannot use an 
         RSA_2048 public wrapping key with any RSAES_OAEP_SHA_* wrapping algorithm to wrap 
         an ECC_NIST_P521 (secp521r1) private key. You must use a larger public wrapping key or an 
         RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP wrapping algorithm.
         The following example encrypts your key material with the public key that you 
         downloaded and the RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1 wrapping algorithm, and saves it in the
         EncryptedKeyMaterial.bin ﬁle.
         In this example:
         •
           WrappingPublicKey.bin is the ﬁle that contains the downloaded wrapping public key.
         •
           PlaintextKeyMaterial.bin is the ﬁle that contains the key material that you are 
           encrypting, such as PlaintextKeyMaterial.bin, HMAC_384_PlaintextKey.bin or
           ECC_NIST_P521_PrivateKey.der.

      RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256
         AWS KMS supports the RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 for symmetric encryption keys 
         (SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT), elliptic curve (ECC) private keys, SM2 private keys, and HMAC keys.
         RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 is not supported for RSA private keys. Also, you cannot use an 
         RSA_2048 public wrapping key with any RSAES_OAEP_SHA_* wrapping algorithm to 
         wrap an ECC_NIST_P521 (secp521r1) private key. You must use a larger public key or an 
         RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP wrapping algorithm.
         The following example encrypts key material with the public key that you downloaded and the 
         RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 wrapping algorithm, and saves it in the EncryptedKeyMaterial.bin
         ﬁle.

      RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_1
         The RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_1 wrapping algorithm involves two encryption operations.
         1. Encrypt your key material with an AES symmetric key that you generate and an AES 
            symmetric encryption algorithm.
         2. Encrypt the AES symmetric key that you used with the public key that you downloaded and 
            the RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1 wrapping algorithm.
         The RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_1 wrapping algorithm requires OpenSSL version 3.x or later.
         1.  Generate a 256-bit AES symmetric encryption key
             This command generates an AES symmetric encryption key consisting of 256 random bits, 
             and saves it in the aes-key.bin ﬁle
               # Generate a 32-byte AES symmetric encryption key
               $ openssl rand -out aes-key.bin 32
         2.  Encrypt your key material with the AES symmetric encryption key
             This command encrypts your key material with the AES symmetric encryption key and 
             saves the encrypted key material in the key-material-wrapped.bin ﬁle.
             In this example command:
             •
               PlaintextKeyMaterial.bin is the ﬁle that contains the key material that you are 
               importing, such as PlaintextKeyMaterial.bin, HMAC_384_PlaintextKey.bin,
               RSA_3072_PrivateKey.der, or ECC_NIST_P521_PrivateKey.der.
             •
               aes-key.bin is the ﬁle that contains 256-bit AES symmetric encryption key that you

                       -out key-material-wrapped.bin
         3.  Encrypt your AES symmetric encryption key with the public key
             This command encrypts your AES symmetric encryption key with the public key that you 
             downloaded and the RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1 wrapping algorithm, DER-encodes it, and save it 
             in the aes-key-wrapped.bin ﬁle.
             In this example command:
             •
               WrappingPublicKey.bin is the ﬁle that contains the downloaded public wrapping key. 
               If you downloaded the public key from the console, this ﬁle is named wrappingKey_KMS

             •
               aes-key.bin is the ﬁle that contains 256-bit AES symmetric encryption key that you 
               generated in the ﬁrst command in this example sequence.
               # Encrypt your AES symmetric encryption key with the downloaded public key
               $ openssl pkeyutl \

         4.  Generate the ﬁle to import
             Concatenate the ﬁle with the encrypted key material and the ﬁle with the encrypted AES 
             key. Save them in the EncryptedKeyMaterial.bin ﬁle, which is the ﬁle that you'll

      RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_256
         The RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_256 wrapping algorithm involves two encryption operations.
         1. Encrypt your key material with an AES symmetric key that you generate and an AES 
            symmetric encryption algorithm.
         2. Encrypt the AES symmetric key that you used with the public key that you downloaded and 
            the RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 wrapping algorithm.
         The RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_256 wrapping algorithm requires OpenSSL version 3.x or later.
         1.  Generate a 256-bit AES symmetric encryption key
             This command generates an AES symmetric encryption key consisting of 256 random bits, 
             and saves it in the aes-key.bin ﬁle
               # Generate a 32-byte AES symmetric encryption key
               $ openssl rand -out aes-key.bin 32
         2.  Encrypt your key material with the AES symmetric encryption key
             This command encrypts your key material with the AES symmetric encryption key and 
             saves the encrypted key material in the key-material-wrapped.bin ﬁle.
             In this example command:

         3.  Encrypt your AES symmetric encryption key with the public key
             This command encrypts your AES symmetric encryption key with the public key that you 
             downloaded and the RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 wrapping algorithm, DER-encodes it, and save 
             it in the aes-key-wrapped.bin ﬁle.

         4.  Generate the ﬁle to import
             Concatenate the ﬁle with the encrypted key material and the ﬁle with the encrypted AES 
             key. Save them in the EncryptedKeyMaterial.bin ﬁle, which is the ﬁle that you'll 
             import in the Step 4: Import the key material.
             In this example command:
             •
               key-material-wrapped.bin is the ﬁle that contains your encrypted key material.
             •
               aes-key-wrapped.bin is the ﬁle that contains the encrypted AES encryption key.
               # Combine the encrypted AES key and encrypted key material in a file
               $ cat aes-key-wrapped.bin key-material-wrapped.bin > EncryptedKeyMaterial.bin
      Proceed to Step 4: Import the key material.
      Step 4: Import the key material
      After you encrypt your key material, you can import the key material to use with an AWS KMS 
      key. To import key material, you upload the encrypted key material from Step 3: Encrypt the key 
      material and the import token that you downloaded at Step 2: Download the wrapping public key 
      and import token. You must import key material into the same KMS key that you speciﬁed when 
      you downloaded the public key and import token. When key material is successfully imported, 
      the key state of the KMS key changes to Enabled, and you can use the KMS key in cryptographic 
      operations.
      When you import key material, you can set an optional expiration time for the key material. When 
      the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and the KMS key becomes unusable. 
      After you import your key material, you cannot set, change, or cancel the expiration date for the 
      current import. To change these values, you must reimport the same key material.
      For all KMS keys with EXTERNAL origin, the ﬁrst key material imported into it becomes current and 
      permanently associated with it. Single-Region, symmetric encryption keys with EXTERNAL origin 
      support on-demand rotation. You can associate multiple key materials with imported keys that 
      support on-demand rotation. You must set the importType parameter to NEW_KEY_MATERIAL
      with the ImportKeyMaterial action to associate new key material with a KMS key. This key 
      material is not permanently associated with the key until you perform the RotateKeyOnDemand
      Step 4: Import the key material                                                         325
      AWS Key Management Service                                                  Developer Guide
      action. Until then, this key material is in PENDING_ROTATION state. The default value of the 
      optional ImportType parameter is EXISTING_KEY_MATERIAL. When you omit the ImportType
      parameter or specify it as EXISTING_KEY_MATERIAL, you must import a key material that is 
      previously associated with the KMS key.
      For asymmetric, HMAC or multi-Region KMS keys with EXTERNAL origin, only one key material 
      can ever be associated with the key. AWS KMS will reject  ImportKeyMaterial API requests with the
      ImportType parameter.
      When all key materials permanently associated with a KMS key are imported, the KMS key is 
      available for use in cryptographic operations. If any one of these key materials is deleted or 
      allowed to expire, the KMS key state changes to PendingImport and the key is unusable for 
      cryptographic operations.
      To import key material, you can use the AWS KMS console or the ImportKeyMaterial API. You can 
      use the API directly by making HTTP requests, or by using an AWS SDKs, AWS Command Line 
      Interface or AWS Tools for PowerShell.
      When you import the key material, an ImportKeyMaterial entry is added to your AWS CloudTrail 
      log to record the ImportKeyMaterial operation. The CloudTrail entry is the same whether you 
      use the AWS KMS console or the AWS KMS API.
      Setting an expiration time (optional)
      When you import the key material for your KMS key, you can set an optional expiration date and 
      time for the key material of up to 365 days from the import date. When imported key material 
      expires, AWS KMS deletes it. This action changes the key state of the KMS key to PendingImport, 
      which prevents it from being used in any cryptographic operation. To use the KMS key, you must
      reimport a copy of the original key material.
      Ensuring that imported key material expires frequently can help you to satisfy regulatory 
      requirements, but it introduces an additional a risk to data encrypted under the KMS key. Until you 
      reimport a copy of the original key material, a KMS key with expired key material is unusable, and 
      any data encrypted under the KMS key is inaccessible. If you fail to reimport the key material for 
      any reason, including losing your copy of the original key material, the KMS key is permanently 
      unusable, and data encrypted under the KMS key is unrecoverable.
      To mitigate this risk, make sure that your copy of the imported key material is accessible, and 
      design a system to delete and reimport the key material before it expires and interrupts your AWS 
      workload. We recommend that you set an alarm for the expiration of your imported key material 
      Step 4: Import the key material                                                     326
      AWS Key Management Service                                               Developer Guide
      that gives you plenty of time to reimport the key material before it expires. You can also use your 
      CloudTrail logs to audit operations that import (and reimport) key material and delete imported 
      key material, and the AWS KMS operation to delete expired key material.
      AWS KMS cannot restore, recover, or reproduce the deleted key material. Instead of setting 
      an expiration time, you can programmatically delete and reimport the imported key material 
      periodically, but the requirements for retaining a copy of the original key material are the same.
      You determine whether and when imported key material expires when you import the key material. 
      However you can turn expiration on and oﬀ, or set a new expiration time by reimporting the key 
      material. Use the ExpirationModel parameter of ImportKeyMaterial to turn expiration on 
      (KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES) and oﬀ (KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE) and the ValidTo
      parameter to set the expiration time. The maximum time is 365 days from the import data; there is 
      no minimum, but the time must be in the future.
      Set key material description
      Single-Region, symmetric encryption keys with EXTERNAL origin can have multiple key materials 
      associated with them. You can specify an optional key material description when importing key 
      material into such keys. The description can be used to keep track of where the corresponding key 
      material is durably maintained outside AWS KMS.
      Reimport key material
      If you manage a KMS key with imported key material, you might need to reimport the key material. 
      You might reimport key material to replace expiring or deleted key material, or to change the 
      expiration model or expiration date of the key material.
      You can reimport key material at any time, on any schedule that meets your security requirements. 
      You do not have to wait until the key material is at or close to its expiration time.
      The procedure to reimport key material is the same procedure that you use to import the key 
      material the ﬁrst time, with the following exceptions.
      • Use an existing KMS key, instead of creating a new KMS key. You can skip Step 1 of the import 
        procedure.
      • When you reimport key material, you can change the expiration model and expiration date.
      Each time you import key material to a KMS key, you need to download and use a new wrapping 
      key and import token for the KMS key. The wrapping procedure does not aﬀect the content of the 
      Step 4: Import the key material                                                 327

      key material, so you can use diﬀerent wrapping public keys and diﬀerent wrapping algorithms to 
      import the same key material.
      Import new key material
      To perform on-demand rotation on a symmetric encryption KMS key with imported key material, 
      you'll ﬁrst need to import new key material, not previously associated with the key. Use the
      ImportKeyMaterial operation with the ImportType parameter set to NEW_KEY_MATERIAL to 
      accomplish this task. Key material imported in this manner will be in PENDING_ROTATION state 
      until you perform the RotateKeyOnDemand operation or rotate the key in the AWS Management 
      Console. A KMS key can have at most one key material in PENDING_ROTATION state at any time.
      Import key material (console)
      You can use the AWS Management Console to import key material.
      1.  If you are on the Upload your wrapped key material page, skip to Step 8.
      2.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      3.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      4.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
      5.  Choose the key ID or alias of the KMS key for which you downloaded the public key and import 
          token.
      6.  Choose the Cryptographic conﬁguration tab and view its values. The tabs are on the detail 
          page for a KMS key below the General conﬁguration section.
          You can only import key material into KMS keys with an Origin of External (Import key 
          material). For information about creating KMS keys with imported key material, see Importing 
          key material for AWS KMS keys.
      7.  For asymmetric, HMAC and multi-Region keys, choose the Key material tab and then choose
          Import key material. For single-Region, symmetric encryption keys, choose the Key material 
          and rotations tab. Then, choose either Import initial key material or Import new key 
          material or Reimport key material. The Reimport key material option is available in the
          Actions menu in the key materials table.
          If you downloaded the key material, import token, and encrypted the key material, choose
          Next.
      Step 4: Import the key material                                                         328

      8.  In the Encrypted key material and import token section, do the following.
          a.  Under Wrapped key material, choose Choose ﬁle. Then upload the ﬁle that contains your 
              wrapped (encrypted) key material.
          b.  Under Import token, choose Choose ﬁle. Upload the ﬁle that contains the import token 
              that you downloaded.
      9.  In the Expiration option section, you determine whether the key material expires. To set an 
          expiration date and time, choose Key material expires, and use the calendar to select a date 
          and time. You can specify a date up to 365 days from the current date and time.
      10. For symmetric encryption keys, you can optionally specify a description for the key material 
          being imported.
      11. Choose Import key material.
      Import key material (AWS KMS API)
      To import key material, use the ImportKeyMaterial operation. The following example uses the AWS 
      CLI, but you can use any supported programming language.
      To use this example:
      1.
         Replace 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab with a key ID of the KMS key that you 
         speciﬁed when you downloaded the public key and import token. To identify the KMS key, use 
         its key ID or key ARN. You cannot use an alias name or alias ARN for this operation.
      2.
         Replace EncryptedKeyMaterial.bin with the name of the ﬁle that contains the encrypted 
         key material.
      3.
         Replace ImportToken.bin with the name of the ﬁle that contains the import token.
      4.
         If you want the imported key material to expire, set the value of the expiration-model
         parameter to its default value, KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES, or omit the expiration-model
         parameter. Then, replace the value of the valid-to parameter with the date and time that you 
         want the key material to expire. The date and time can be up to 365 days from the time of the 
         request.
          $ aws kms import-key-material --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
              --encrypted-key-material fileb://EncryptedKeyMaterial.bin \ 
              --import-token fileb://ImportToken.bin \ 
              --expiration-model KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES \ 
      Step 4: Import the key material                                                         329

              --valid-to 2023-06-17T12:00:00-08:00
         If you do not want the imported key material to expire, set the value of the expiration-
         model parameter to KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE and omit the valid-to parameter 
         from the command.
          $ aws kms import-key-material --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
              --encrypted-key-material fileb://EncryptedKeyMaterial.bin \ 
              --import-token fileb://ImportToken.bin \ 
              --expiration-model KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE
      5. If you want to import new key material, not previously associated with the KMS key, set 
         the ImportType parameter to NEW_KEY_MATERIAL. This option can only be used with 
         single-Region symmetric encryption keys. For these keys, you can also use the optional
         KeyMaterialDescription parameter to set a description for the imported key material in the 
         following command line example:
          $ aws kms import-key-material --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
              --encrypted-key-material fileb://EncryptedKeyMaterial.bin \ 
              --import-token fileb://ImportToken.bin \ 
              --expiration-model KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES \ 
              --valid-to 2023-06-17T12:00:00-08:00 \ 
              --import-type NEW_KEY_MATERIAL \ 
              --key-material-description "Q2 2025 Rotation"
                  
           Tip
           If the command does not succeed, you might see a KMSInvalidStateException or a
           NotFoundException. You can retry the request.
      Create a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store
      After you have created an AWS CloudHSM key store, you can create AWS KMS keys in your key 
      store. They must be symmetric encryption KMS keys with key material that AWS KMS generates. 
      You cannot create asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys or KMS keys with imported key material
      in a custom key store. Also, you cannot use symmetric encryption KMS keys in a custom key store 
      Create a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store                                           330
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      to generate asymmetric data key pairs. KMS cannot communicate over IPv6 with AWS CloudHSM 
      key stores.
      To create a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store, the AWS CloudHSM key store must be
      connected to the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster and the cluster must contain at least two 
      active HSMs in diﬀerent Availability Zones. To ﬁnd the connection state and number of HSMs, 
      view the AWS CloudHSM key stores page in the AWS Management Console. When using the API 
      operations, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation to verify that the AWS CloudHSM key 
      store is connected. To verify the number of active HSMs in the cluster and their Availability Zones, 
      use the AWS CloudHSM DescribeClusters operation.
      When you create a KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS creates the KMS key in 
      AWS KMS. But, it creates the key material for the KMS key in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. 
      Speciﬁcally, AWS KMS signs into the cluster as the kmsuser CU that you created. Then it creates 
      a persistent, non-extractable, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric key in the 
      cluster. AWS KMS sets the value of the key label attribute, which is visible only in the cluster, to 
      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.
      When the command succeeds, the key state of the new KMS key is Enabled and its origin is
      AWS_CLOUDHSM. You cannot change the origin of any KMS key after you create it. When you view 
      a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store in the AWS KMS console or by using the DescribeKey
      operation, you can see typical properties, like its key ID, key state, and creation date. But you can 
      also see the custom key store ID and (optionally) the AWS CloudHSM cluster ID.
      If your attempt to create a KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store fails, use the error 
      message to help you determine the cause. It might indicate that the AWS CloudHSM key 
      store is not connected (CustomKeyStoreInvalidStateException) or the associated 
      AWS CloudHSM cluster doesn't have the two active HSMs that are required for this operation 
      (CloudHsmClusterInvalidConfigurationException). For help see Troubleshooting a 
      custom key store.
      For an example of the AWS CloudTrail log of the operation that creates a KMS key in an AWS 
      CloudHSM key store, see CreateKey.
      Create a new KMS key in your CloudHSM key store
      You can create a symmetric encryption KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store in the AWS KMS 
      console or by using the CreateKey operation.

          When you add tags to your AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report with 
          usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For 
          information about tagging KMS keys, see Tags in AWS KMS and ABAC for AWS KMS.
      14. Choose Next.
      15. In the Key Administrators section, select the IAM users and roles who can manage the KMS 
          key. For more information, see Allows key administrators to administer the KMS key.
               Notes
               IAM policies can give other IAM users and roles permission to use the KMS key.
               IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. 
               Whenever possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials. For details, see
               Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
               The AWS KMS console adds key administrators to the key policy under the statement 
               identiﬁer "Allow access for Key Administrators". Modifying this statement 
               identiﬁer might impact how the console displays updates that you make to the 
               statement.
      16. (Optional) To prevent these key administrators from deleting this KMS key, clear the box at the 
          bottom of the page for Allow key administrators to delete this key.

               Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.
               The AWS KMS console adds key users to the key policy under the statement 
               identiﬁers "Allow use of the key" and "Allow attachment of persistent 
               resources". Modifying these statement identiﬁers might impact how the console 
               displays updates that you make to the statement.

      19. (Optional) You can allow other AWS accounts to use this KMS key for cryptographic operations. 
          To do so, in the Other AWS accounts section at the bottom of the page, choose Add another 
          AWS account and enter the AWS account ID of an external account. To add multiple external 
          accounts, repeat this step.
               Note
               Administrators of the other AWS accounts must also allow access to the KMS key by 
               creating IAM policies for their users. For more information, see Allowing users in other 
               accounts to use a KMS key.
      20. Choose Next.
      21. Review the key policy statements for the key. To make changes to the key policy, select Edit.
      22. Choose Next.
      23. Review the key settings that you chose. You can still go back and change all settings.
      24. When you're done, choose Finish to create the key.
      When the procedure succeeds, the display shows the new KMS key in the AWS CloudHSM key 
      store that you chose. When you choose the name or alias of the new KMS key, the Cryptographic 
      conﬁguration tab on its detail page displays the origin of the KMS key (AWS CloudHSM), the 
      name, ID, and type of the custom key store, and the ID of the AWS CloudHSM cluster. If the 
      procedure fails, an error message appears that describes the failure.
           Tip
           To make it easier to identify KMS keys in a custom key store, on the Customer managed 
           keys page, add the Custom key store ID column to the display. Click the gear icon in the 
           upper-right and select Custom key store ID. For details, see Customize your console view.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To create a new AWS KMS key (KMS key) in your AWS CloudHSM key store, use the CreateKey
      operation. Use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify your custom key store and specify 
      an Origin value of AWS_CLOUDHSM.

      You might also want to use the Policy parameter to specify a key policy. You can change the key 
      policy (PutKeyPolicy) and add optional elements, such as a description and tags at any time.
      The examples in this section use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any 
      supported programming language.
      The following example begins with a call to the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation to verify that 
      the AWS CloudHSM key store is connected to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. By default, this 
      operation returns all custom keys stores in your account and Region. To describe only a particular 
      AWS CloudHSM key store, use its CustomKeyStoreId or CustomKeyStoreName parameter (but 
      not both).
      Before running this command, replace the example custom key store ID with a valid ID.
           Note
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in the Description or Tags ﬁelds. 
           These ﬁelds may appear in plain text in CloudTrail logs and other output.
        $ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
        { 
           "CustomKeyStores": [ 
              "CustomKeyStoreId": "cks-1234567890abcdef0", 
              "CustomKeyStoreName": "ExampleKeyStore",

               "ConnectionState": "CONNECTED"
           ],
        }
      The next example command uses the DescribeClusters operation to verify that the AWS CloudHSM 
      cluster that is associated with the ExampleKeyStore (cluster-1a23b4cdefg) has at least two active 
      HSMs. If the cluster has fewer than two HSMs, the CreateKey operation fails.

      Create a KMS key in external key stores
      After you have created and connected your external key store, you can create AWS KMS keys in 
      your key store. They must be symmetric encryption KMS keys with an origin value of External key 
      store (EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE). You cannot create asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys or KMS 
      keys with imported key material in a custom key store. Also, you cannot use symmetric encryption 
      KMS keys in a custom key store to generate asymmetric data key pairs.
      A KMS key in an external key store might have poorer latency, durability and availability than a 
      standard KMS key because it depends on components located outside of AWS. Before creating 
      or using a KMS key in an external key store, verify that you require a key with external key store 
      properties.

           Note
           Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating KMS keys in an external 
           key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation.
      To create a KMS key in your external key store, you specify the following:
      • The ID of your external key store.
      •
        A key material origin of External key store (EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE).
      • The ID of an existing external key in the external key manager associated with your external key 
        store. This external key serves as key material for the KMS key. You cannot change the external 
        key ID after you create the KMS key.
        AWS KMS provides the external key ID to your external key store proxy in requests for encryption 
        and decryption operations. AWS KMS cannot directly access your external key manager or any of 
        its cryptographic keys.
      In addition to the external key, a KMS key in an external key store also has AWS KMS key material. 
      All data encrypted under the KMS key is ﬁrst encrypted in AWS KMS using the key's AWS KMS key 
      material and then by your external key manager using your external key. This double encryption
      process ensures that ciphertext protected by a KMS key in an external key store is at least as strong 
      as ciphertext protected only by AWS KMS. For details, see How external key stores work.
      When the CreateKey operation succeeds, the key state of the new KMS key is Enabled. When 
      you view a KMS key in an external key store you can see typical properties, like its key ID, key spec,
      key usage, key state, and creation date. But you can also see the ID and connection state of the 
      external key store and the ID of the external key.
      If your attempt to create a KMS key in your external key store fails, use the error message 
      to identify the cause. It might indicate that the external key store is not connected 
      (CustomKeyStoreInvalidStateException), that your external key store proxy cannot 
      ﬁnd an external key with the speciﬁed external key ID (XksKeyNotFoundException), or 
      that the external key is already associated with a KMS key in the same external key store
      XksKeyAlreadyInUseException.
      For an example of the AWS CloudTrail log of the operation that creates a KMS key in an external 
      key store, see CreateKey.

        AWS KMS also recommends that the external key be used exclusively for the external key store. 
        This restriction makes it easier to identify and resolve problems with the key.
      • Accessible by the external key store proxy for the external key store.
        If the external key store proxy can't ﬁnd the key using the speciﬁed external key ID, the
        CreateKey operation fails.
      • Can handle the anticipated traﬃc that your use of AWS services generates. AWS KMS 
        recommends that external keys be prepared to handle up to 1800 requests per second.
      Create a new KMS key in your external key store
      You can create a new KMS key in your external key store in the AWS KMS console or by using the
      CreateKey operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      There are two ways to create a KMS key in an external key store.
      • Method 1 (recommended): Choose an external key store, then create a KMS key in that external 
        key store.
      • Method 2: Create a KMS key, then indicate that it's in an external key store.
      If you use Method 1, where you choose your external key store before you create your key, AWS 
      KMS chooses all required KMS key properties for you and ﬁlls in the ID of your external key store. 
      This method avoids errors you might make when creating your KMS key.
           Note
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in the alias, description, or tags. These 
           ﬁelds may appear in plain text in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      Method 1 (recommended): Start in your external key store
      To use this method, choose your external key store, then create a KMS key. The AWS KMS console 
      chooses all required properties for you and ﬁlls in the ID of your external key store. This method 
      avoids many errors you might make when creating your KMS key.

      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, External key stores.
      4.  Choose the name of your external key store.
      5.  In the top right corner, choose Create a KMS key in this key store.
          If the external key store is not connected, you will be prompted to connect it. If the connection 
          attempt fails, you need to resolve the problem and connect the external key store before you 
          can create a new KMS key in it.
          If the external key store is connected, you are redirected to the Customer managed keys page 
          for creating a key. The required Key conﬁguration values are already chosen for you. Also, the 
          custom key store ID of your external key store is ﬁlled in, although you can change it.
      6.  Enter the key ID of an external key in your external key manager. This external key must fulﬁll 
          the requirements for use with a KMS key. You cannot change this value after the key is created.
          If the external key has multiple IDs, enter the key ID that the external key store proxy uses to 
          identify the external key.
      7.  Conﬁrm that you intend to create a KMS key in the speciﬁed external key store.
      8.  Choose Next.
          The remainder of this procedure is the same as creating a standard KMS key.
      9.  Type an alias (required) and a description (optional) for the KMS key.
      10. (Optional). On the Add Tags page, add tags that identify or categorize your KMS key.
          When you add tags to your AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report with 
          usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For 
          information about tagging KMS keys, see Tags in AWS KMS and ABAC for AWS KMS.
      11. Choose Next.
      12. In the Key Administrators section, select the IAM users and roles who can manage the KMS 
          key. For more information, see Allows key administrators to administer the KMS key.

           Customize your console view.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To create a new KMS key in an external key store, use the CreateKey operation. The following 
      parameters are required:
      •
        The Origin value must be EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE.
      •
        The CustomKeyStoreId parameter identiﬁes your external key store. The ConnectionState
        of the speciﬁed external key store must be CONNECTED. To ﬁnd the CustomKeyStoreId and
        ConnectionState, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
      •
        The XksKeyId parameter identiﬁes the external key. This external key must fulﬁlls the 
        requirements for association with a KMS key.

      You can also use any of the optional parameters of the CreateKey operation, such as using the
      Policy or Tags parameters.
           Note
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in the Description or Tags ﬁelds. 
           These ﬁelds may appear in plain text in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      The examples in this section use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any 
      supported programming language.
      This example command uses the CreateKey operation to create a KMS key in an external key store. 
      The response includes the properties of the KMS keys, the ID of the external key store, and the ID, 
      usage, and status of the external key.
      Before running this command, replace the example custom key store ID with a valid ID.

      Identify and view keys
      You can use AWS Management Console or the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) API to 
      view AWS KMS keys in each account and Region, including KMS keys that you manage and KMS 
      keys that are managed by AWS.
      Topics

      • Access and list KMS key details
      • Identify diﬀerent key types
      • Customize your console view
      • Find KMS keys and key material in an AWS CloudHSM key store
      Find the key ID and key ARN
      To identify an AWS KMS key, you can use the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (key ARN). In
      cryptographic operations, you can also use the alias name or alias ARN.
      You can use the AWS KMS console or the ListKeys operation to identify the key ID and key ARN of 
      each KMS key in your account and Region.
      For detailed information about the KMS key identiﬁers supported by AWS KMS, see Key identiﬁers 
      (KeyId). For help ﬁnding an alias name and alias ARN, see Find the alias name and alias ARN for a 
      KMS key.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      1.  Open the AWS KMS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  To view the keys in your account that you create and manage, in the navigation pane choose
          Customer managed keys. To view the keys in your account that AWS creates and manages for 
          you, in the navigation pane, choose AWS managed keys.
      4.  To ﬁnd the key ID for a KMS key, see the row that begins with the KMS key alias.

          The Key ID column appears in the tables by default. If the Key ID column doesn't appear in 
          your table, use the procedure described in the section called “Customize your console view” to 
          restore it. You can also view the key ID of a KMS key on its details page.
      5.  To ﬁnd the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key, choose the key ID or alias. The key 
          ARN appears in the General Conﬁguration section.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To ﬁnd the key ID and key ARN of an AWS KMS key, use the ListKeys operation.
      The ListKeys operation returns the key ID and Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of all KMS keys in 
      the caller's account and Region.
      For example, this call to the ListKeys operation returns the ID and ARN of each KMS key in this 
      ﬁctitious account. For examples in multiple programming languages, see Use ListKeys with an 
      AWS SDK or CLI.

        }
      Access and list KMS key details
      You can use the AWS KMS console or the DescribeKey operation to access and list detailed 
      information about the KMS keys in the account and Region.
      The following procedures demonstrate how to access KMS key details, such as the key ID, key spec, 
      key usage, and more.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      The details page for each KMS key displays the properties of the KMS key. It diﬀers slightly for the 
      diﬀerent types of KMS keys.
      To display detailed information about a KMS key, on the AWS managed keys  or Customer 
      managed keys page, choose the alias or key ID of the KMS key.
      The details page for a KMS key includes a General Conﬁguration section that displays the basic 
      properties of the KMS key. It also includes tabs on which you can view and edit properties of the 
      KMS key, such as Key policy, Cryptographic conﬁguration, Tags, Key material and rotations (for 
      KMS keys that support automatic or on-demand rotation), Regionality (for multi-Region keys), and
      Public key (for asymmetric KMS keys).
           Note
           The AWS KMS console displays the KMS keys that you have permission to view in your 
           account and Region. KMS keys in other AWS accounts do not appear in the console, even if 
           you have permission to view, manage, and use them. To view KMS keys in other accounts, 
           use the DescribeKey operation.

      Identify asymmetric KMS keys
      In the AWS KMS console
         The Key type column of the Customer managed keys table shows whether each KMS key 
         is symmetric or asymmetric. You can ﬁlter the table by the Key type value to display only 
         asymmetric KMS keys. For more information see the section called “Sort and ﬁlter your KMS 
         keys”.
         The Cryptographic conﬁguration tab on the details page for a KMS key displays the Key Type, 
         which indicates whether the key is symmetric or asymmetric. It also displays the Key Usage, 
         which indicates whether your asymmetric KMS key is used for encryption and decryption, 
         signing and veriﬁcation, or deriving shared secrets.
      In DescribeKey responses
         When you call the DescribeKey operation on an asymmetric KMS key the response includes 
         the KeySpec and KeyUsage values, which can be used to determine if a KMS key is symmetric 
         or asymmetric.
         If the KeySpec value is SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, the key is a symmetric encryption KMS key. For 
         details on asymmetric key specs, see Key spec reference.
         If the KeyUsage value is SIGN_VERIFY or KEY_AGREEMENT, the key is an asymmetric KMS key.
         The DescribeKey operation also returns the following details for asymmetric KMS keys.
         •
           For asymmetric KMS keys with a KeyUsage value of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, the operation 
           returns the EncryptionAlgorithms, which lists the valid encryption algorithms for the key.
         •
           For asymmetric KMS keys with a KeyUsage value of SIGN_VERIFY, the operation returns the
           SigningAlgorithms, which lists the valid signing algorithms for the key.
         •
           For asymmetric KMS keys with a KeyUsage value of KEY_AGREEMENT, the operation returns 
           the KeyAgreementAlgorithms, which lists the valid key agreement algorithms for the key.
      For more information on asymmetric KMS keys, see the section called “Asymmetric keys”.
      Identify asymmetric KMS keys                                                         360

      Identify HMAC KMS keys
      In the AWS KMS console
         HMAC KMS keys are included in the Customer managed keys table, but you cannot sort or ﬁlter 
         this table by the key spec or key usage values that identify HMAC keys. To make it easier to ﬁnd 
         your HMAC keys, assign them a distinctive alias or tag. Then you can sort or ﬁlter by the alias or 
         tag.
         The Cryptographic conﬁguration tab on the details page for a KMS key displays the Key Type, 
         which indicates whether the key is symmetric or asymmetric. HMAC KMS keys are symmetric. 
         The Cryptographic conﬁguration tab also displays the Key Usage. For HMAC KMS keys the key 
         usage value is always Generate and verify MAC.
      In DescribeKey responses
         When you call the DescribeKey operation on an HMAC KMS key the response includes 
         the KeySpec and KeyUsage values. For HMAC KMS keys the key usage value is always
         GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC and the key spec value always starts with HMAC_.
      For more information on HMAC KMS keys, see the section called “HMAC keys”.
      Identify multi-Region KMS keys
      In the AWS KMS console
         The Customer managed keys table only displays KMS keys in the selected Region. You can view 
         multi-Region primary and replica keys in the selected Region. To change the AWS Region, use 
         the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the console.
         To make it easier to identify multi-Region keys in the Customer managed keys table, add the
         Regionality column to your table. For help, see the section called “Customize your KMS key 
         tables”.
         The detail page for multi-Region KMS keys includes a Regionality tab. The Regionality tab 
         for a primary key includes Change primary Region and Create new replica keys buttons. (The 
         Regionality tab for a replica key has neither button.) The Related multi-Region keys section 
         lists all multi-Region keys related to the current one. If the current key is a replica key, this list 
         includes the primary key.
      Identify HMAC KMS keys                                                               361
      AWS Key Management Service                                                    Developer Guide
         If you choose a related multi-Region key from the Related multi-Region keys table, the AWS 
         KMS console changes to the Region of the selected key and it opens the detail page for the key. 
         For example, if you choose the replica key in the sa-east-1 Region from the example Related 
         multi-Region keys section below, the AWS KMS console changes to the sa-east-1 Region to 
         display the detail page for that replica key. You might do this to view the alias or key policy for 
         the replica key. To change the Region again, use the Region selector at the top right corner of 
         the page.
      In DescribeKey responses
         By default, AWS KMS API operations are Regional and only return the resources in the current 
         or speciﬁed Region. But, when you call the DescribeKey operation on a multi-Region 
         KMS key, the response includes all related multi-Region keys in other AWS Regions in the
         MultiRegionConfiguration element.
      For more information on multi-Region KMS keys, see the section called “Multi-Region keys”.
      Identify KMS keys with imported key material
      In the AWS KMS console
         To make it easier to identify KMS keys with imported key material in the Customer managed 
         keys table, add the Origin column to your table. The Origin column makes it easy to identify 
         KMS keys with an External (Import Key material) origin property value. For help, see the 
         section called “Customize your KMS key tables”.
         The Cryptographic conﬁguration tab on the details page for a KMS key displays the Origin, 
         which identiﬁes the source of the key material for the KMS key. For KMS keys with imported 
         key material, the origin value is always External (Import Key material). The details page 
         also includes a Key material tab that provides detailed information about the imported key 
         material. Single-Region, symmetric encryption keys with EXTERNAL origin support on-demand 
         rotations and can have multiple key materials associated with them. For such keys, the tab is 
         labeled Key material and rotations.
      In DescribeKey responses
         When you call the DescribeKey operation on a KMS key with imported key material the 
         response includes the Origin, ExpirationModel, and ValidTo values. For KMS keys with 
         imported key material the origin value is always EXTERNAL. The ExpirationModel value

      AWS Key Management Service                                                    Developer Guide
         indicates whether or not the key material is set to expire, and the ValidTo value indicates 
         when the key material will expire. When multiple key materials are associated with a key, the
         ValidTo value indicates the earliest expiry time across all key materials (except for the one 
         pending rotation) and ExpirationModel is set to DOES_NOT_EXPIRE only if none of these 
         key materials are set to expire. For more information, see Setting an expiration time (optional).
      For more information on KMS keys with imported key material, see the section called “Imported 
      key material”.
      Identify KMS keys in AWS CloudHSM key stores
      In the AWS KMS console
         To make it easier to identify KMS keys in AWS CloudHSM key stores in the Customer managed 
         keys table, add the Origin column to your table. The Origin column makes it easy to identify 
         KMS keys with an AWS CloudHSM origin property value. For help, see the section called 
         “Customize your KMS key tables”.
         The Cryptographic conﬁguration tab on the details page for a KMS key displays the Origin, 
         which identiﬁes the source of the key material for the KMS key. For KMS keys in AWS CloudHSM 
         key stores, the origin value is always AWS CloudHSM.
         For a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store, the Cryptographic conﬁguration tab includes an 
         additional section, Custom key store, that provides information about the AWS CloudHSM key 
         store and AWS CloudHSM cluster associated with the KMS key.
      In DescribeKey responses
         When you call the DescribeKey operation on a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store the 
         response includes the Origin, which identiﬁes the source of the key material. For KMS keys 
         in an AWS CloudHSM key store the origin value is always AWS_CLOUDHSM. The operation also 
         returns the following special ﬁelds for KMS keys in AWS CloudHSM key stores:
         •
           CloudHsmClusterId
         •
           CustomKeyStoreId
      For more information on AWS CloudHSM key stores, see the section called “AWS CloudHSM key 
      stores”.

      Identify KMS keys in external key stores
      In the AWS KMS console
         To make it easier to identify KMS keys in external key stores in the Customer managed keys
         table, add the Origin column to your table. The Origin column makes it easy to identify 
         KMS keys with an External key store origin property value. For help, see the section called 
         “Customize your KMS key tables”.
         The Cryptographic conﬁguration tab on the details page for a KMS key displays the Origin, 
         which identiﬁes the source of the key material for the KMS key. For KMS keys in external key 
         stores, the origin value is always External key store.
         For a KMS key in an external key store, the Cryptographic conﬁguration tab includes two 
         additional sections, Custom key store and External key. The Custom key store table provides 
         information about the external key store associated with the KMS key. The External key
         table appears in the AWS KMS console only for KMS keys in external key stores. It provides 
         information about the external key associated with the KMS key. The external key is a 
         cryptographic key outside of AWS that serves as the key material for the KMS key in the 
         external key store. When you encrypt or decrypt with the KMS key, the operation is performed 
         by your external key manager using the speciﬁed external key.
         The following values appear in the External key section.
         External key ID
            The identiﬁer for the external key in its external key manager. This is the value that the 
            external key store proxy uses to identify the external key. You specify the ID of the external 
            key when you create the KMS key and you cannot change it. If the external key ID value that 
            you used to create the KMS key changes or becomes invalid, you must schedule the KMS key 
            for deletion and create a new KMS key with the correct external key ID value.
      In DescribeKey responses
         When you call the DescribeKey operation on a KMS key in an external key store the response 
         includes the Origin, which identiﬁes the source of the key material. For KMS keys in an AWS 
         CloudHSM key store the origin value is always EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE. The operation also 
         returns the CustomKeyStoreId element, which identiﬁes the external key store associated 
         with the KMS keys.

      Sort and ﬁlter your KMS keys
      To make it easier to ﬁnd your KMS keys in the console, you can sort and ﬁlter the key tables.
      Sort
         You can sort KMS keys in ascending or descending order by their column values. This feature 
         sorts all KMS keys in the table, even if they don't appear on the current table page.
         Sortable columns are indicated by an arrow beside the column name. On the AWS managed 
         keys page, you can sort by Aliases or Key ID. On the Customer managed keys page, you can 
         sort by Aliases, Key ID, or Key type.
         To sort in ascending order, choose the column heading until the arrow points upward. To sort in 
         descending order, choose the column heading until the arrow points downward. You can sort by 
         only one column at a time.
         For example, you can sort KMS keys in ascending order by key ID, instead of aliases, which is the 
         default.
      Customize your console view                                                             365
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
       When you sort KMS keys on the Customer managed keys page in ascending order by Key type, 
       all asymmetric keys are displayed before all symmetric keys.
     Filter
       You can ﬁlter KMS keys by their property values or tags. The ﬁlter applies to all KMS keys in the 
       table, even if they don't appear on the current table page. The ﬁlter is not case-sensitive.
       Filterable properties are listed in the ﬁlter box. On the AWS managed keys  page, you can ﬁlter 
       by alias and key ID. On the Customer managed keys page, you can ﬁlter by the alias, key ID, 
       and key type properties, and by tags.
       • On the AWS managed keys page, you can ﬁlter by alias and key ID.
       • On the Customer managed keys page, you can ﬁlter by tags, or by the alias, key ID, key type, 
         or regionality properties.
       To ﬁlter by a property value, choose the ﬁlter, choose the property name, and then choose from 
       the list of actual property values. To ﬁlter by a tag, choose the tag key, and then choose from 
       the list of actual tag values. After choosing a property or tag key, you can also type all or part of 
       the property value or tag value. You'll see a preview of the results before you make your choice.
       For example, to display KMS keys with an alias name that contains aws/e, choose the ﬁlter box, 
       choose Alias, type aws/e, and then press Enter or Return to add the ﬁlter.

      Suggested KMS key table ﬁlters
      Filter for asymmetric KMS keys
         To display only asymmetric KMS keys on the Customer managed keys page, click the ﬁlter box, 
         choose Key type and then choose Key type: Asymmetric. The Asymmetric option appears only 
         when you have asymmetric KMS keys in the table.
      Filter for multi-Region keys
         To display only multi-Region keys, on the Customer managed keys page, choose the ﬁlter box, 
         choose Regionality and then choose Regionality: Multi-Region. The Multi-Region option 
         appears only when you have multi-Region keys in the table.
      Filter for tags
         To display only KMS keys with a particular tag, choose the ﬁlter box, choose the tag key, and 
         then choose from among the actual tag values. You can also type all or part of the tag value.
         The resulting table displays all KMS keys with the chosen tag. However, it doesn't display the 
         tag. To see the tag, choose the key ID or alias of the KMS key and on its detail page, choose the
         Tags tab. The tabs appear below the General conﬁguration section.
         This ﬁlter requires both the tag key and tag value. It won't ﬁnd KMS keys by typing only 
         the tag key or only its value. To ﬁlter tags by all or part of the tag key or value, use the
         ListResourceTags operation to get tagged KMS keys, then use the ﬁltering features of your 
         programming language.
      Filter by text
         To search for text, in the ﬁlter box, type all or part of an alias, key ID, key type, or tag key. (After 
         you select the tag key, you can search for a tag value ). You'll see a preview of the results before 
         you make your choice.
         For example, to display KMS keys with test in its tag keys or ﬁlterable properties, type test
         in the ﬁlter box. The preview shows the KMS keys that the ﬁlter will select. In this case, test
         appears only in the Alias property.

      choose is saved when you conﬁrm it and reapplied whenever you open the pages.
      To customize your KMS key tables
      1.  On the AWS managed keys or Customer managed keys page, choose the settings icon 
          (                                                                                  ) 
          in the upper-right corner of the page.
      2.  On the Preferences page, choose your preferred settings, and then choose Conﬁrm.
      Consider using the Page size setting to increase the number of KMS keys displayed on each page, 
      especially if you typically use a device that's easy to scroll.
      The data columns that you display might vary depending on the table, your job role, and the types 
      of KMS keys in the account and Region. The following table oﬀers some suggested conﬁgurations. 
      For descriptions of the columns, see Using the AWS KMS console.
      Suggested KMS key table conﬁgurations
      You can customize the columns that appear in your KMS key table to display the information you 
      need about your KMS keys.
      AWS managed keys
         By default, the AWS managed key table displays the Aliases, Key ID, and Status columns. 
         These columns are ideal for most use cases.
      Symmetric encryption KMS keys
         If you use only symmetric encryption KMS keys with key material generated by AWS KMS, the
         Aliases, Key ID, Status, and Creation date columns are likely to be the most useful.
      Asymmetric KMS keys
         If you use asymmetric KMS keys, in addition to the Aliases, Key ID, and Status columns, 
         consider adding the Key type, Key spec, and Key usage columns. These columns will show you 
         whether a KMS key is symmetric or asymmetric, the type of key material, and whether the KMS 
         key can be used for encryption or signing.
      Customize your KMS key tables                                                       368

      HMAC KMS keys
         If you use HMAC KMS keys, in addition to the Aliases, Key ID, and Status columns, consider 
         adding the Key spec and Key usage columns. These columns will show you whether a KMS key 
         is an HMAC key. Because you can't sort KMS keys by key spec or key usage, use aliases and tags 
         to identify your HMAC keys and then use the ﬁlter features of the AWS KMS console to ﬁlter by 
         aliases or tags.
      Imported key material
         If you have KMS keys with imported key material, consider adding the Origin and Expiration 
         date columns. These columns will show you whether the key material in a KMS key is imported 
         or generated by AWS KMS and when the key material expires, if at all. The Creation date ﬁeld 
         displays the date that the KMS key was created (without key material). It doesn't reﬂect any 
         characteristic of the key material.
      Keys in custom key stores
         If you have KMS keys in custom key stores, consider adding the Origin and Custom key store ID
         columns. These columns show that the KMS key is in a custom key store, display the custom key 
         store type, and identify the custom key store.
      Multi-Region keys
         If you have multi-Region keys, consider adding the Regionality column. This shows whether a 
         KMS key is a single-Region key, a multi-Region primary key or a multi-Region replica key.
      Find KMS keys and key material in an AWS CloudHSM key store
      If you manage an AWS CloudHSM key store, you might need to identify the KMS keys in each AWS 
      CloudHSM key store. For example, you might need to do some of the following tasks.
      • Track the KMS keys in AWS CloudHSM key store in AWS CloudTrail logs.
      • Predict the eﬀect on KMS keys of disconnecting an AWS CloudHSM key store.
      • Schedule deletion of KMS keys before you delete an AWS CloudHSM key store.
      In addition, you might want to identify the keys in your AWS CloudHSM cluster that serve as key 
      material for your KMS keys. Although AWS KMS manages the KMS keys and the key material, you 
      still retain control of and responsibility for the management of your AWS CloudHSM cluster, as well 
      as the HSMs and backups and the keys in the HSMs. You might need to identify the keys in order

      to audit the key material, protect it from accidental deletion, or delete it from HSMs and cluster 
      backups after deleting the KMS key.
      All key material for the KMS keys in your AWS CloudHSM key store is owned by the kmsuser
      crypto user (CU). AWS KMS sets the key label attribute, which is viewable only in AWS CloudHSM, 
      to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.

      Find the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store
      If you manage an AWS CloudHSM key store, you might need to identify the KMS keys in each 
      AWS CloudHSM key store. You can use this information to track the KMS key operations in AWS 
      CloudTrail logs, predict the eﬀect of disconnecting a custom key store on KMS keys, or schedule 
      deletion of KMS keys before you delete an AWS CloudHSM key store.
      To ﬁnd the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store (console)
      To ﬁnd the KMS keys in a particular AWS CloudHSM key store, on the Customer managed keys
      page, view the values in the Custom Key Store Name or Custom Key Store ID ﬁelds. To identify 
      KMS keys in any AWS CloudHSM key store, look for KMS keys with an Origin value of AWS 
      CloudHSM. To add optional columns to the display, choose the gear icon in the upper right corner 
      of the page.
      To ﬁnd the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store (API)
      To ﬁnd the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store, use the ListKeys and DescribeKey operations 
      and then ﬁlter by CustomKeyStoreId value. Before running the following examples, replace the 
      ﬁctitious custom key store ID values with a valid value.

           Notes
           The following procedures use the AWS CloudHSM Client SDK 5 command line tool,
           CloudHSM CLI. The CloudHSM CLI replaces key-handle with key-reference.
           On January 1, 2025, AWS CloudHSM will end support for the Client SDK 3 command line 
           tools, the CloudHSM Management Utility (CMU) and the Key Management Utility (KMU). 
           For more information on the diﬀerences between the Client SDK 3 command line tools and 
           the Client SDK 5 command line tool, see Migrate from Client SDK 3 CMU and KMU to Client 
           SDK 5 CloudHSM CLI in the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.
      To run this procedure you need to disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store temporarily so you can 
      log in as the kmsuser CU.
      1.  Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store, if it is not already disconnected, then log in as
          kmsuser, as explained in How to disconnect and log in.
               Note
               While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS keys in the 
               custom key store or to use existing KMS keys in cryptographic operations will fail. This 
               action can prevent users from storing and accessing sensitive data.
      2.  Use the key list command in CloudHSM CLI to ﬁnd all keys for the current user present in your 
          AWS CloudHSM cluster.
          By default, only 10 keys of the currently logged in user are displayed, and only the key-
          reference and label are displayed as output. For more options, see key list in the AWS 
          CloudHSM User Guide.

      Find the KMS key for an AWS CloudHSM key
      If you know the key reference or ID of a key that the kmsuser owns in the cluster, you can use that 
      value to identify the associated KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store.
      When AWS KMS creates the key material for a KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM cluster, it writes the 
      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key in the key label. Unless you have changed the label 
      value, you can use the key list command in CloudHSM CLI to identify the KMS key associated with 
      the AWS CloudHSM key.

      Identify the KMS key associated with a key reference
      The following procedures demonstrate how to use the key list command in CloudHSM CLI with 
      the key-reference attribute ﬁlter to ﬁnd the key in your cluster that serves as key material for a 
      particular KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store.
      1.  Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store, if it is not already disconnected, then log in as
          kmsuser, as explained in How to disconnect and log in.
      2.
          Use the key list command in CloudHSM CLI to ﬁlter by the key-reference attribute. Specify 
          the verbose argument to include all attributes and key information for the matched key. If 
          you don't specify the verbose argument, the key list operation only returns the matched 
          key's key-reference and label attribute.
          Before running this command, replace the example key-reference with a valid one from 
          your account.

      Identify the KMS key associated with a backing key ID
      All CloudTrail log entries for cryptographic operations with a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key 
      store include an additionalEventData ﬁeld with the customKeyStoreId and backingKeyId. 
      The value returned in the backingKeyId ﬁeld correlates to the CloudHSM key id attribute. You 
      can ﬁlter the key list operation by the id attribute to identify the KMS key associated with a 
      speciﬁc backingKeyId.
      1.  Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store, if it is not already disconnected, then log in as
          kmsuser, as explained in How to disconnect and log in.
      2.  Use the key list command in CloudHSM CLI with the attribute ﬁlter to ﬁnd the key in your 
          cluster that serves as key material for a particular KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store.
          The following example demonstrates how to ﬁlter by the id attribute. AWS CloudHSM 
          recognizes the id value as a hexadecimal value. To ﬁlter the key list operation by the
          id attribute, you must ﬁrst convert the backingKeyId value that you identiﬁed in your 
          CloudTrail log entry into a format that AWS CloudHSM recognizes.
          a.
              Use the following Linux command to convert the backingKeyId into a hexadecimal 
              representation.
                echo backingKeyId | tr -d '\n' |  xxd -p
              The following example demonstrates how to convert the backingKeyId byte array into a 
              hexadecimal representation.

      3.  Log out and reconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store as described in How to log out and 
          reconnect.
      Find the AWS CloudHSM key for a KMS key
      You can use the KMS key ID of a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store to identify the key in your 
      AWS CloudHSM cluster that serves as its key material.
      When AWS KMS creates the key material for a KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM cluster, it writes the 
      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key in the key label. Unless you have changed the label 
      value, you can use the key list command in CloudHSM CLI to ﬁnd the key-resource and id of the 
      key material for the KMS key.
      All CloudTrail log entries for cryptographic operation with a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key 
      store include an additionalEventData ﬁeld with the customKeyStoreId and backingKeyId. 
      The value returned in the backingKeyId ﬁeld is the id AWS CloudHSM key attribute. You can 
      ﬁlter the key list AWS CloudHSM CLI operation by KMS key ARN to identify the CloudHSM key id
      attribute associated with a speciﬁc KMS key.
      To run this procedure, you need to disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store temporarily so you can 
      log in as the kmsuser CU.

           Notes
           The following procedures use the AWS CloudHSM Client SDK 5 command line tool,
           CloudHSM CLI. The CloudHSM CLI replaces key-handle with key-reference.
           On January 1, 2025, AWS CloudHSM will end support for the Client SDK 3 command line 
           tools, the CloudHSM Management Utility (CMU) and the Key Management Utility (KMU). 
           For more information on the diﬀerences between the Client SDK 3 command line tools and 
           the Client SDK 5 command line tool, see Migrate from Client SDK 3 CMU and KMU to Client 
           SDK 5 CloudHSM CLI in the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.
      1.  Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store, if it is not already disconnected, then log in as
          kmsuser, as explained in How to disconnect and log in.
               Note
               While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS keys in the 
               custom key store or to use existing KMS keys in cryptographic operations will fail. This 
               action can prevent users from storing and accessing sensitive data.
      2.
          Use the key list command in CloudHSM CLI and ﬁlter by label to ﬁnd the KMS key for a 
          particular key in your AWS CloudHSM cluster. Specify the verbose argument to include 
          all attributes and key information for the matched key. If you don't specify the verbose
          argument, the key list operation only returns the matched key's key-reference and label 
          attributes.
          The following example demonstrates how to ﬁlter by the label attribute that stores the KMS 
          key ARN. Before running this command, replace the example KMS key ARN with a valid one 
          from your account.

      Enable and disable keys
      You can disable and re-enable customer managed keys. When you create a KMS key, it is enabled 
      by default. If you disable a KMS key, it cannot be used in any cryptographic operation until you re-
      enable it.
      Because it's temporary and easily undone, disabling a KMS key is a safe alternative to deleting a 
      KMS key, an action that is destructive and irreversible. If you are considering deleting a KMS key, 
      disable it ﬁrst and set a CloudWatch alarm or similar mechanism to be certain that you'll never 
      need to use the key to decrypt encrypted data.
      When you disable a KMS key, it becomes unusable right away (subject to eventual consistency). 
      However, resources encrypted with data keys protected by the KMS key are not aﬀected until the 
      the KMS key is used again, such as to decrypt the data key. This issue aﬀects AWS services, many of 
      which use data keys to protect your resources. For details, see How unusable KMS keys aﬀect data 
      keys.
      You cannot enable or disable AWS managed keys or AWS owned keys. AWS managed keys are 
      permanently enabled for use by services that use AWS KMS. AWS owned keys are managed solely 
      by the service that owns them.
           Note
           AWS KMS does not rotate the key material of customer managed keys while they are 
           disabled. For more information, see How key rotation works.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      You can use the AWS KMS console to enable and disable customer managed keys.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
      4.  Choose the check box for the KMS keys that you want to enable or disable.
      Using the AWS KMS console                                                               382

      5.  To enable a KMS key, choose Key actions, Enable. To disable a KMS key, choose Key actions,
          Disable.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      The EnableKey operation enables a disabled AWS KMS key. These examples use the AWS Command 
      Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any supported programming language. The key-id
      parameter is required.
      This operation does not return any output. To see the key status, use the DescribeKey operation.
        $ aws kms enable-key --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
      The DisableKey operation disables an enabled KMS key. The key-id parameter is required.
        $ aws kms disable-key --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
      This operation does not return any output. To see the key status, use the DescribeKey operation, 
      and see the Enabled ﬁeld.

     Rotate AWS KMS keys
     To create new cryptographic material for your customer managed keys, you can create new KMS 
     keys, and then change your applications or aliases to use the new KMS keys. Or, you can rotate the 
     key material associated with an existing KMS key by enabling automatic key rotation or performing 
     on-demand rotation.
     By default, when you enable automatic key rotation for a KMS key, AWS KMS generates new 
     cryptographic material for the KMS key every year. You can also specify a custom rotation-period
     to deﬁne the number of days after you enable automatic key rotation that AWS KMS will rotate 
     your key material, and the number of days between each automatic rotation thereafter. If you need 
     to immediately initiate key material rotation, you can perform on-demand rotation, regardless of 
     whether or not automatic key rotation is enabled. On-demand rotations do not change existing 
     automatic rotation schedules.
     You can track the rotation of key material for your KMS keys in Amazon CloudWatch, AWS 
     CloudTrail, and the AWS Key Management Service console. You can also use GetKeyRotationStatus
     operation to verify whether automatic rotation is enabled for a KMS key and identify any in 
     progress on-demand rotations. You can use ListKeyRotations operation to view the details of 
     completed rotations.
     Key rotation changes only the current key material, which is the cryptographic secret that is used 
     in encryption operations. When you use the rotated KMS key to decrypt ciphertext, AWS KMS 
     uses the key material that was used to encrypt it. You cannot select a particular key material for 
     decrypt operations, AWS KMS automatically chooses the correct key material. Because AWS KMS 
     transparently decrypts with the appropriate key material, you can safely use a rotated KMS key in 
     applications and AWS services without code changes.
     The KMS key is the same logical resource, regardless of whether or how many times its key material 
     changes. The properties of the KMS key do not change, as shown in the following image.
                                                                       385
      AWS Key Management Service                                             Developer Guide
      You might decide to create a new KMS key and use it in place of the original KMS key. This has the 
      same eﬀect as rotating the key material in an existing KMS key, so it's often thought of as manually 
      rotating the key. Manual rotation is a good choice when you want to rotate KMS keys that are not 
      eligible for automatic or on-demand key rotation, including asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS 
      keys, KMS keys in custom key stores, and multi-Region KMS keys with imported key material.
          Note
          Key rotation has no eﬀect on the data that the KMS key protects. It does not rotate the 
          data keys that the KMS key generated or re-encrypt any data protected by the KMS key. 
          Key rotation will not mitigate the eﬀect of a compromised data key.
      Key rotation and pricing
      AWS KMS charges a monthly fee for ﬁrst and second rotation of key material maintained for your 
      KMS key. This price increase is capped at the second rotation, and any subsequent rotations will not 
      be billed. For details, see AWS Key Management Service Pricing.
          Note
          You can use the AWS Cost Explorer Service to view a breakdown of your key storage 
          charges. For example, you can ﬁlter your view to see the total charges for keys billed as 
          current and rotated KMS keys by specifying $REGION-KMS-Keys for the Usage Type and 
          grouping the data by API Operation.
          You might still see instances of the legacy Unknown API operation for historical dates.
      Key rotation and quotas
      Each KMS key counts as one key when calculating key resource quotas, regardless of the number of 
      rotated key material versions.
      For detailed information about key material and rotation, see AWS Key Management Service 
      Cryptographic Details.

      Why rotate KMS keys?
      Cryptographic best practices discourage extensive reuse of keys that encrypt data directly, such as 
      the data keys that AWS KMS generates. When 256-bit data keys encrypt millions of messages they 
      can become exhausted and begin to produce ciphertext with subtle patterns that clever actors can 
      exploit to discover the bits in the key. It's best to use data keys once, or just a few times, to mitigate 
      this key exhaustion.
      However, KMS keys are most often used as wrapping keys, also known as key-encryption keys. 
      Instead of encrypting data, wrapping keys encrypt the data keys that encrypt your data. As 
      such, they are used far less often than data keys, and are almost never reused enough to risk key 
      exhaustion.
      Despite this very low exhaustion risk, you might be required to rotate your KMS keys due to 
      business or contract rules or government regulations. When you are compelled to rotate KMS keys, 
      we recommend that you use automatic key rotation where it is supported, use on-demand rotation 
      if automatic rotation is not supported, and manual key rotation when neither automatic nor on-
      demand key rotation is supported.
      You might consider performing on-demand rotations to demonstrate key material rotation 
      capabilities or to validate automation scripts. We recommend using on-demand rotations for 
      unplanned rotations, and using automatic key rotation with a custom rotation period whenever 
      possible.
      How key rotation works
      AWS KMS key rotation is designed to be transparent and easy to use. AWS KMS supports optional 
      automatic and on-demand key rotation only for customer managed keys.
      Why rotate KMS keys?                                                                    387
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Automatic key rotation
         AWS KMS rotates the KMS key automatically on the next rotation date deﬁned by your rotation 
         period. You don't need to remember or schedule the update.
         Automatic key rotation is supported only on symmetric encryption KMS keys with key material 
         that AWS KMS generates (AWS_KMS origin).
         Automatic rotation is optional for customer managed KMS keys. AWS KMS always rotates 
         the key material for AWS managed KMS keys every year. Rotation of AWS owned KMS keys is 
         managed by the AWS service that owns the key.
      On-demand rotation
         Immediately initiate rotation of the key material associated with your KMS key, regardless of 
         whether or not automatic key rotation is enabled.
         On-demand key rotation is supported on symmetric encryption KMS keys with key material that 
         AWS KMS generates (AWS_KMS origin) and single-Region, symmetric encryption KMS keys with 
         imported key material (EXTERNAL origin).
      Manual rotation
         Neither automatic nor on-demand key rotation is supported for the following types of KMS 
         keys, but you can rotate these KMS keys manually.
         • Asymmetric KMS keys
         • HMAC KMS keys
         • KMS keys in custom key stores
         • Multi-Region KMS keys with imported key material
      Managing key material
         AWS KMS retains all key material for a KMS key with AWS_KMS origin, even if key rotation is 
         disabled. AWS KMS deletes key material only when you delete the KMS key.
         You manage the key materials for symmetric encryption keys with EXTERNAL origin. You can 
         delete any key material using the DeleteImportedKeyMaterial operation or set an expiration 
         time when importing the material. The KMS key becomes unusable as soon as any of its

      Using key material
         When you use a rotated KMS key to encrypt data, AWS KMS uses the current key material. When 
         you use the rotated KMS key to decrypt ciphertext, AWS KMS uses the same version of the key 
         material that was used to encrypt it. You cannot select a particular version of the key material 
         for decrypt operations, AWS KMS automatically chooses the correct version.
      Rotation period
         Rotation period deﬁnes the number of days after you enable automatic key rotation that 
         AWS KMS will rotate your key material, and the number of days between each automatic key 
         rotation thereafter. If you do not specify a value for RotationPeriodInDays when you 
         enable automatic key rotation, the default value is 365 days.
         You can use the kms:RotationPeriodInDays condition key to further constrain the values that 
         principals can specify in the RotationPeriodInDays parameter.
      Rotation date
         Rotation date reﬂects the date when the current key material for a KMS key was updated either 
         as a result of automatic (scheduled) rotation or an on-demand key rotation.
      Rotation date
         AWS KMS automatically rotates the KMS key on the rotation date deﬁned by your rotation 
         period. The default rotation period is 365 days.
         Customer managed keys
            Because automatic key rotation is optional on customer managed keys and can be enabled 
            and disabled at any time, the rotation date depends on the date that rotation was most 
            recently enabled. The date can change if you modify the rotation period for a key that you 
            previously enabled automatic key rotation on. The rotation date can change many times 
            over the life of the key.
            For example, if you create a customer managed key on January 1, 2022, and enable 
            automatic key rotation with the default rotation period of 365 days on March 15, 2022, 
            AWS KMS rotates the key material on March 15, 2023, March 15, 2024, and every 365 days 
            thereafter.
            The following examples assume that automatic key rotation was enabled with the default 
            rotation period of 365 days. These examples demonstrate special cases that might impact a 
            key's rotation period.
      How key rotation works                                                           389
      AWS Key Management Service                                             Developer Guide
           • Disable key rotation — If you disable automatic key rotation at any point, the KMS key 
             continues to use the version of the key material it was using when rotation was disabled. If 
             you enable automatic key rotation again, AWS KMS rotates the key material based on the 
             new rotation-enable date.
           • Disabled KMS keys — While a KMS key is disabled, AWS KMS does not rotate it. However, 
             the key rotation status does not change, and you cannot change it while the KMS key is 
             disabled. When the KMS key is re-enabled, if the key material is past its last scheduled 
             rotation date , AWS KMS rotates it immediately. If the key material has not missed its last 
             scheduled rotation date, AWS KMS resumes the original key rotation schedule.
           • KMS keys pending deletion — While a KMS key is pending deletion, AWS KMS does not 
             rotate it. The key rotation status is set to false and you cannot change it while deletion 
             is pending. If deletion is canceled, the previous key rotation status is restored. If the 
             key material is past its last scheduled rotation date, AWS KMS rotates it immediately. If 
             the key material has not missed its last scheduled rotation date, AWS KMS resumes the 
             original key rotation schedule.
         AWS managed keys
           AWS KMS automatically rotates AWS managed keys every year (approximately 365 days). 
           You cannot enable or disable key rotation for AWS managed keys.
           The key material for an AWS managed key is ﬁrst rotated one year after its creation date, 
           and every year (approximately 365 days from the last rotation) thereafter.
                Note
                In May 2022, AWS KMS changed the rotation schedule for AWS managed keys from 
                every three years (approximately 1,095 days) to every year (approximately 365 days).
         AWS owned keys
           You cannot enable or disable key rotation for AWS owned keys. The key rotation strategy for 
           an AWS owned key is determined by the AWS service that creates and manages the key. For 
           details, see the Encryption at Rest topic in the user guide or developer guide for the service.
      How key rotation works                                                        390

      Rotating multi-Region keys
         You can enable and disable automatic rotation and perform on-demand rotation of the key 
         material in symmetric encryption multi-Region keys with AWS_KMS origin. Key rotation is a
         shared property of multi-Region keys.
         You enable and disable automatic key rotation only on the primary key. You initiate on-demand 
         rotation only on the primary key.
         • When AWS KMS synchronizes the multi-Region keys, it copies the key rotation property 
           setting from the primary key to all of its related replica keys.
         • When AWS KMS rotates the key material, it creates new key material for the primary key and 
           then copies the new key material across Region boundaries to all related replica keys. The key 
           material never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. This step is carefully controlled to ensure that 
           key material is fully synchronized before any key is used in a cryptographic operation.
         • AWS KMS does not encrypt any data with the new key material until that key material is 
           available in the primary key and every one of its replica keys.
         • When you replicate a primary key that has been rotated, the new replica key has the current 
           key material and all previous versions of the key material for its related multi-Region keys.
         This pattern ensures that related multi-Region keys are fully interoperable. Any multi-Region 
         key can decrypt any ciphertext encrypted by a related multi-Region key, even if the ciphertext 
         was encrypted before the key was created.
      AWS services
         You can enable automatic key rotation on the customer managed keys that you use for server-
         side encryption in AWS services. The annual rotation is transparent and compatible with AWS 
         services.
      Monitoring key rotation
         When AWS KMS rotates the key material for an AWS managed key or customer managed key, it 
         writes a KMS CMK Rotation event to Amazon EventBridge and a RotateKey event to your AWS 
         CloudTrail log. You can use these records to verify that the KMS key was rotated.
         You can use the AWS Key Management Service console to view the number of remaining on-
         demand rotations and a list of all completed key material rotations for a KMS key.
         You can use ListKeyRotations operation to view the details of completed rotations.
      How key rotation works                                                                391
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Eventual consistency
         Key rotation is subject to the same eventual consistency eﬀects as other AWS KMS management 
         operations. There might be a slight delay before the new key material is available throughout 
         AWS KMS. However, rotating key material does not cause any interruption or delay in 
         cryptographic operations. The current key material is used in cryptographic operations until the 
         new key material is available throughout AWS KMS. When key material for a multi-Region key 
         is automatically rotated, AWS KMS uses the current key material until the new key material is 
         available in all Regions with a related multi-Region key.
      Enable automatic key rotation
      By default, when you enable automatic key rotation for a KMS key, AWS KMS generates new 
      cryptographic material for the KMS key every year. You can also specify a custom rotation-period
      to deﬁne the number of days after you enable automatic key rotation that AWS KMS will rotate 
      your key material, and the number of days between each automatic rotation thereafter.
      Automatic key rotation has the following beneﬁts:
      • The properties of the KMS key, including its key ID, key ARN, region, policies, and permissions, do 
        not change when the key is rotated.
      • You do not need to change applications or aliases that refer to the key ID or key ARN of the KMS 
        key.
      • Rotating key material does not aﬀect the use of the KMS key in any AWS service.
      • After you enable key rotation, AWS KMS rotates the KMS key automatically on the next rotation 
        date deﬁned by your rotation period. You don't need to remember or schedule the update.
      You can enable automatic key rotation in the AWS KMS console or by using the EnableKeyRotation
      operation. To enable automatic key rotation, you need kms:EnableKeyRotation permissions. 
      For more information about AWS KMS permissions, see the Permissions reference.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.

      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys. (You cannot enable or disable 
          rotation of AWS managed keys. They are automatically rotated every year.)
      4.  Choose the alias or key ID of a KMS key.
      5.  Choose the Key rotation tab.
          The Key rotation tab appears only on the detail page of symmetric encryption KMS keys 
          with key material that AWS KMS generated (the Origin is AWS_KMS), including multi-Region
          symmetric encryption KMS keys.
          You cannot automatically rotate asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, KMS keys with
          imported key material, or KMS keys in custom key stores. However, you can rotate them 
          manually.
      6.  In the Automatic key rotation section, choose Edit.
      7.  For Key rotation, select Enable.
               Note
               If a KMS key is disabled or pending deletion, AWS KMS does not rotate the key material 
               and you cannot update the automatic key rotation status or rotation period. Enable 
               the KMS key or cancel deletion to update the automatic key rotation conﬁguration. For 
               details, see How key rotation works and Key states of AWS KMS keys.
      8.  (Optional) Type a rotation period between 90 and 2560 days. The default value is 365 days. If 
          you do not specify a custom rotation period, AWS KMS will rotate the key material every year.
          You can use the kms:RotationPeriodInDays condition key to limit the values that principals can 
          specify for the rotation period.
      9.  Choose Save.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      You can use the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) API to enable automatic key rotation 
      and view the current rotation status of any customer managed key. These examples use the AWS 
      Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any supported programming language.
      Enable automatic key rotation                                                           393

      The EnableKeyRotation operation enables automatic key rotation for the speciﬁed KMS key. To 
      identify the KMS key in this operation, use its key ID or key ARN. By default, key rotation is disabled 
      for customer managed keys.
      You can use the  kms:RotationPeriodInDays condition key to limit the values that principals can 
      specify for the RotationPeriodInDays parameter of an EnableKeyRotation request.
      The following example enables key rotation with a rotation period of 180 days on the speciﬁed 
      symmetric encryption KMS key and uses the GetKeyRotationStatus operation to see the result.
        $ aws kms enable-key-rotation \ 
            --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
            --rotation-period-in-days 180
        $ aws kms get-key-rotation-status --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
        {

            "NextRotationDate": "2024-02-14T18:14:33.587000+00:00"
        }
      Disable automatic key rotation
      After enabling automatic key rotation on a customer managed key, you can choose to disable it at 
      any time.
      If you disable automatic key rotation, the KMS key continues to use the version of the key material 
      it was using when rotation was disabled. If you enable automatic key rotation again, AWS KMS 
      rotates the key material based on the new rotation-enable date.
      Disabling automatic rotation does not impact your ability to perform on-demand rotations, nor 
      does it cancel any in progress on-demand rotations.
      You can disable automatic key rotation in the AWS KMS console or by using the DisableKeyRotation
      operation. To disable automatic key rotation, you need kms:DisableKeyRotation permissions. 
      For more information about AWS KMS permissions, see the Permissions reference.

      The DisableKeyRotation operation disables automatic key rotation. To identify the KMS key in this 
      operation, use its key ID or key ARN. By default, key rotation is disabled for customer managed 
      keys.
      The following example disables automatic key rotation on the speciﬁed symmetric encryption KMS

            "KeyRotationEnabled": false
        }
                    
      Perform on-demand key rotation
      You can perform on-demand rotation of the key material in customer managed KMS keys, 
      regardless of whether or not automatic key rotation is enabled. Disabling automatic rotation 
      (DisableKeyRotation) does not impact your ability to perform on-demand rotations, nor does 
      it cancel any in progress on-demand rotations. On-demand rotations do not change existing 
      automatic rotation schedules. For example, consider a KMS key that has automatic key rotation 
      enabled with a rotation period of 730 days. If the key is scheduled to automatically rotate on April 
      14, 2024, and you perform an on-demand rotation on April 10, 2024, the key will automatically 
      rotate, as scheduled, on April 14, 2024 and every 730 days thereafter.
      You can perform on-demand key rotation a maximum of 10 times per KMS key. You can use the 
      AWS KMS console to view the number of remaining on-demand rotations available for a KMS key.
      On-demand key rotation is supported only on symmetric encryption KMS keys. You cannot 
      perform on-demand rotation of asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, multi-Region KMS keys 
      with imported key material, or KMS keys in a custom key store. To perform on-demand rotation of 
      a set of related multi-Region keys, invoke the on-demand rotation on the primary key.
      Authorized users with kms:RotateKeyOnDemand and kms:GetKeyRotationStatus permissions 
      can use the AWS KMS console and the AWS KMS API to initiate on-demand key rotation and view 
      the key rotation status. Use ListKeyRotations to view completed rotations for a KMS key.

      speciﬁed KMS key. To identify the KMS key in these operations, use its key ID or key ARN.
      The following example initiates on-demand key rotation on the speciﬁed symmetric encryption 
      KMS key and uses the GetKeyRotationStatus operation to verify that the on-demand rotation is in 
      progress. The OnDemandRotationStartDate in the kms:GetKeyRotationStatus response 
      identiﬁes the date and time that an in progress on-demand rotation was initiated. In this example, 
      the KMS key also has automatic rotation enabled with a period of 365 days.
        $ aws kms rotate-key-on-demand --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
        { 
            "KeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"     
        }
        $ aws kms get-key-rotation-status --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
        { 
            "KeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab", 
            "KeyRotationEnabled": true,

        }
      If the KMS key does not support automatic rotation or does not have automatic rotation enabled, 
      the kms:GetKeyRotationStatus response would have fewer ﬁelds as shown in the following 
      example:
        $ aws kms rotate-key-on-demand --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

      List rotations and key materials
      KMS keys that support automatic or on-demand key rotation can have multiple key materials 
      associated with them. These keys have an initial key material and one additional key material for 
      each automatic or on-demand rotation.
      Authorized users with kms:ListKeyRotations permission can use the AWS KMS console and 
      the ListKeyRotations API to list all key materials associated with a KMS key, including those from 
      completed automatic and on-demand rotations.

          • The Key materials table in the Key material and rotations tab lists all the key materials 
            associated with the KMS key. For each key material, the corresponding entry displays its 
            unique identiﬁer assigned by AWS KMS, the rotation date, and key material state. The 
            rotation date identiﬁes when the key material became current after an automatic or 
            on-demand key rotation. There is no rotation date associated with the ﬁrst or Pending 
            rotation key material. The key material state determines how AWS KMS uses the key 
            material. Current key material is used for both encryption and decryption. Non-current key 
            material is only used for decryption. A key material state of Pending rotation indicates 
            the key material is staged for rotation. This key material is not used for any cryptographic 
            operation until an on-demand key rotation makes it the current key material. Additional 
            information displayed for the key material depends on type of KMS key.
          •
            For symmetric encryption KMS keys with AWS_KMS origin, each row also displays the rotation 
            type — On-demand or Automatic.
          •
            Single-Region, symmetric encryption KMS keys with imported key material (EXTERNAL
            origin) only support On-demand rotation, so there is no rotation type column. Instead, each 
            row displays an import state, a user-speciﬁed description, expiration information, and an
            Actions menu. The import state is either Imported indicating the key material is available 
            inside AWS KMS or Pending import indicating the key material is not available inside 
            AWS KMS. The Actions menu can be used to delete imported key material or reimport key 
            material. The Delete key material action is disabled if the import state of the key material is
            Pending import. The Reimport key material action is always available. You do not need to 
            wait for a key material to expire or be deleted before reimporting it.
      List rotations and key materials (AWS KMS API)
      You can use the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) API to initiate on-demand key rotation 
      and view the current rotation status of any customer managed key. This example uses the AWS 
      Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any supported programming language.
      The ListKeyRotations operation lists all rotations and key materials for the speciﬁed KMS key. To 
      identify the KMS key in these operations, use its key ID or key ARN.
      This operation supports an optional IncludeKeyMaterial parameter. The default value of this 
      parameter is ROTATIONS_ONLY. If you omit this parameter, AWS KMS returns information on 
      the key materials created by automatic or on-demand key rotation. When you specify a value of
      ALL_KEY_MATERIAL, AWS KMS adds the ﬁrst key material and any imported key material pending

      Rotate keys manually
      You might want to create a new KMS key and use it in place of a current KMS key instead of using 
      automatic or on-demand key rotation. When the new KMS key has diﬀerent cryptographic material 
      than the current KMS key, using the new KMS key has the same eﬀect as changing the key material 
      in an existing KMS key. The process of replacing one KMS key with another is known as manual key 
      rotation.
      Rotate keys manually                                                                    401
      AWS Key Management Service                                             Developer Guide
      Manual rotation is a good choice when you want to rotate KMS keys that are not eligible for 
      automatic or on-demand key rotation, such as asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, KMS keys in
      custom key stores, and multi-Region KMS keys with imported key material.
          Note
          When you begin using the new KMS key, be sure to keep the original KMS key enabled so 
          that AWS KMS can decrypt data that the original KMS key encrypted.
      When you rotate KMS keys manually, you also need to update references to the KMS key ID or key 
      ARN in your applications. Aliases, which associate a friendly name with a KMS key, can make this 
      process easier. Use an alias to refer to a KMS key in your applications. Then, when you want to 
      change the KMS key that the application uses, instead of editing your application code, change the 
      target KMS key of the alias. For details, see Learn how to use aliases in your applications.
          Note
          Aliases that point to the latest version of a manually rotated KMS key are a good solution 
          for DescribeKey, GetPublicKey and cryptographic operations like DeriveSharedSecret,
          Encrypt, GenerateDataKey, GenerateDataKeyPair, GenerateMac, VerifyMac, Sign and Verify. 
          Aliases are not permitted in operations that manage KMS keys, such as DisableKey or
          ScheduleKeyDeletion.
          When calling the Decrypt operation on manually rotated symmetric encryption KMS keys, 
          omit the KeyId parameter from the command. AWS KMS automatically uses the KMS key 
          that encrypted the ciphertext.
      Rotate keys manually                                                          402

           The KeyId parameter is required when calling Decrypt or Verify with an asymmetric KMS 
           key, or calling VerifyMac with an HMAC KMS key. These requests fail when the value of 
           the KeyId parameter is an alias that no longer points to the KMS key that performed the 
           cryptographic operation, such as when a key is manually rotated. To avoid this error, you 
           must track and specify the correct KMS key for each operation.
      To change the target KMS key of an alias, use UpdateAlias operation in the AWS KMS API. For 
      example, this command updates the alias/TestKey alias to point to a new KMS key. Because the 
      operation does not return any output, the example uses the ListAliases operation to show that the 
      alias is now associated with a diﬀerent KMS key and the LastUpdatedDate ﬁeld is updated. The 
      ListAliases commands use the query parameter in the AWS CLI to get only the alias/TestKey
      alias.
        $ aws kms list-aliases --query 'Aliases[?AliasName==`alias/TestKey`]'

      Change the primary key in a set of multi-Region keys
      Every set of related multi-Region keys must have a primary key. But you can change the primary 
      key. This action, known as updating the primary Region, converts the current primary key to a 
      replica key and converts one of the related replica keys to the primary key. You might do this if you 
      need to delete the current primary key while maintaining the replica keys, or to locate the primary 
      key in the same Region as your key administrators.
      You can select any related replica key to be the new primary key. Both the primary key and the 
      replica key must be in the Enabled key state when the operation starts.
      The Updating key state
         Even after the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation completes, the process of updating the 
         primary Region might still be in progress for a few more seconds. During this time, the old and 
         new primary keys have a transient key state of Updating. While the key state is Updating, you 
         can use the keys in cryptographic operations, but you cannot replicate the new primary key or 
         perform certain management operations, such as enabling or disabling these keys. Operations 
         such as DescribeKey might display both the old and new primary keys as replicas. The Enabled
         key state is restored when the update is complete.
         For information about the eﬀect of the Updating key state, see Key states of AWS KMS keys.
      How it works
         Suppose you have a primary key in US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1) and a replica key in Europe 
         (Ireland) (eu-west-1). You can use the update feature to change the primary key in US East (N. 
         Virginia) (us-east-1) to a replica key and change the replica key in Europe (Ireland) (eu-west-1) 
         to the primary key.
      Change the primary key in a set of multi-Region keys                                    404
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
       When the update process completes, the multi-Region key in the Europe (Ireland) (eu-west-1) 
       Region is a multi-Region primary key and the key in the US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1) Region 
       is its replica key. If there are other related replica keys, they become replicas of the new primary 
       key. The next time that AWS KMS synchronizes the shared properties of the multi-Region keys, 
       it will get the shared properties from the new primary key and copy them to its replica keys, 
       including the former primary key.
       The update operation has no eﬀect on the key ARN of any multi-Region key. It also has no 
       eﬀect on shared properties, such as the key material, or on independent properties, such as 
       the key policy. However, you might want to update the key policy of the new primary key. For 
       example, you might want to add kms:ReplicateKey permission for trusted principals to the new 
       primary key and remove it from the new replica key.

      Update the primary Region
      You can convert a replica key to a primary key, which changes the former primary key into a replica. 
      To update the primary Region, you need kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion permission in both Regions.
      You can update the primary Region in the AWS KMS console or by using the UpdatePrimaryRegion
      operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      You can update the primary key in the AWS KMS console. Start on the key details page for the 
      current primary key.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
      4.  Select the key ID or alias of the multi-Region primary key. This opens the key details page for 
          the primary key.
          To identify a multi-Region primary key, use the tool icon in the upper right corner to add the
          Regionality column to the table.
      5.  Choose the Regionality tab.
      6.  In the Primary key section, choose Change primary Region.
      7.  Choose the Region of the new primary key. You can choose only one Region from the menu.
          The Change primary Regions menu includes only Regions that have a related multi-Region 
          key. You might not have permission to update the primary Region in all of the Regions on the 
          menu.
      8.  Choose Change primary Region.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To change the primary key in a set of related multi-Region keys, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion
      operation.
      Update the primary Region                                                               406

      Use the KeyId parameter to identify the current primary key. Use the PrimaryRegion parameter 
      to indicate the AWS Region of the new primary key. If the primary key doesn't already have a 
      replica in the new primary Region, the operation fails.
      The following example changes the primary key from the multi-Region key in the us-west-2
      Region to its replica in the eu-west-1 Region. The KeyId parameter identiﬁes the current primary 
      key in the us-west-2 Region. The PrimaryRegion parameter speciﬁes the AWS Region of the 
      new primary key, eu-west-1.
        $ aws kms update-primary-region \ 
              --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/
        mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab \ 
              --primary-region eu-west-1
      When successful, this operation doesn't return any output; just the HTTP status code. To see the 
      eﬀect, call the DescribeKey operation on either of the multi-Region keys. You might want to wait 
      until the key state returns to Enabled. While the key state is Updating, the values for the key 
      might still be in ﬂux.
      For example, the following DescribeKey call gets the details about the multi-Region key in the
      eu-west-1 Region. The output shows that the multi-Region key in the eu-west-1 Region is now 
      the primary key. The related multi-Region key (same key ID) in the us-west-2 Region is now a

      Delete an AWS KMS key
      Deleting an AWS KMS key is destructive and potentially dangerous. It deletes the key material 
      and all metadata associated with the KMS key and is irreversible. After a KMS key is deleted, you 
      can no longer decrypt the data that was encrypted under that KMS key, which means that data 
      becomes unrecoverable. (The only exceptions are multi-Region replica keys and asymmetric and 
      HMAC KMS keys with imported key material.) This risk is signiﬁcant for asymmetric KMS keys used 
      for encryption where, without warning or error, users can continue to generate ciphertexts with the 
      public key that cannot be decrypted after the private key is deleted from AWS KMS.
      You should delete a KMS key only when you are sure that you don't need to use it anymore. If you 
      are not sure, consider disabling the KMS key instead of deleting it. You can re-enable a disabled 
      KMS key and cancel the scheduled deletion of a KMS key, but you cannot recover a deleted KMS 
      key.
      You can only schedule the deletion of a customer managed key. You cannot delete AWS managed 
      keys or AWS owned keys.
      Before deleting a KMS key, you might want to know how many ciphertexts were encrypted under 
      that KMS key. AWS KMS does not store this information and does not store any of the ciphertexts. 
      To get this information, you must determine past usage of a KMS key. For help, go to Determine 
      past usage of a KMS key.
      AWS KMS never deletes your KMS keys unless you explicitly schedule them for deletion and the 
      mandatory waiting period expires.
      However, you might choose to delete a KMS key for one or more of the following reasons:
      • To complete the key lifecycle for KMS keys that you no longer need
      • To avoid the management overhead and costs associated with maintaining unused KMS keys
      • To reduce the number of KMS keys that count against your KMS key resource quota
          Note
          If you close your AWS account, your KMS keys become inaccessible and you are no longer 
          billed for them.
                                                                                    409
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
      AWS KMS records an entry in your AWS CloudTrail log when you schedule deletion of the KMS key 
      and when the KMS key is actually deleted.
      About the waiting period
      Because it is destructive and potentially dangerous to delete a KMS key, AWS KMS requires you to 
      set a waiting period of 7 – 30 days. The default waiting period is 30 days.
      However, the actual waiting period might be up to 24 hours longer than the one you scheduled. To 
      get the actual date and time when the KMS key will be deleted, use the DescribeKey operation. Or 
      in the AWS KMS console, on detail page for the KMS key, in the General conﬁguration section, see 
      the Scheduled deletion date. Be sure to note the time zone.
      During the waiting period, the KMS key status and key state is Pending deletion.
      • A KMS key pending deletion cannot be used in any cryptographic operations.
      • AWS KMS does not rotate the key material of KMS keys that are pending deletion.
      After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key, its aliases, and all related AWS KMS 
      metadata.
      Scheduling the deletion of a KMS key might not immediately aﬀect data keys encrypted by the 
      KMS key. For details, see How unusable KMS keys aﬀect data keys.
      Use the waiting period to ensure that you don't need the KMS key now or in the future. You can
      conﬁgure an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to warn you if a person or application attempts to use the 
      KMS key during the waiting period. To recover the KMS key, you can cancel key deletion before the 
      waiting period ends. After the waiting period ends you cannot cancel key deletion, and AWS KMS 
      deletes the KMS key.
      Special considerations
      Before you schedule your keys for deletion, review the following special considerations for deleting 
      special purpose KMS keys.
      Deleting asymmetric KMS keys
         Users who are authorized can delete symmetric or asymmetric KMS keys. The procedure to 
         schedule the deletion of these KMS keys is the same for both types of keys. However, because 
      About the waiting period                                                              410
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
       the public key of an asymmetric KMS key can be downloaded and used outside of AWS KMS, 
       the operation poses signiﬁcant additional risks, especially for asymmetric KMS keys used for 
       encryption (the key usage is ENCRYPT_DECRYPT).
       • When you schedule the deletion of a KMS key, the key state of KMS key changes to Pending 
         deletion, and the KMS key cannot be used in cryptographic operations. However, scheduling 
         deletion has no eﬀect on public keys outside of AWS KMS. Users who have the public key 
         can continue to use them to encrypt messages. They do not receive any notiﬁcation that the 
         key state is changed. Unless the deletion is canceled, ciphertext created with the public key 
         cannot be decrypted.
       • Alarms, logs, and other strategies that detect attempted use of KMS key that is pending 
         deletion cannot detect use of the public key outside of AWS KMS.
       • When the KMS key is deleted, all AWS KMS actions involving that KMS key fail. However, users 
         who have the public key can continue to use them to encrypt messages. These ciphertexts 
         cannot be decrypted.
       If you must delete an asymmetric KMS key with a key usage of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, use your 
       CloudTrail Log entries to determine whether the public key has been downloaded and shared. If 
       it has, verify that the public key is not being used outside of AWS KMS. Then, consider disabling 
       the KMS key instead of deleting it.
       The risk posed by deleting an asymmetric KMS key is mitigated for asymmetric KMS keys with 
       imported key material. For details, see Deleting KMS keys with imported key material.
     Deleting multi-Region keys
       To delete a primary key, you must schedule the deletion all of its replica keys, and then wait for 
       the replica keys to be deleted. The required waiting period for deleting a primary key begins 
       when the last of its replica keys is deleted. If you must delete a primary key from a particular 
       Region without deleting its replica keys, change the primary key to a replica key by updating the 
       primary Region.
       You can delete a replica key at any time. It doesn't depend on the key state of any other KMS 
       key. If you mistakenly delete a replica key, you can recreate it by replicating the same primary 
       key in the same Region. The new replica key you create will have the same shared properties as 
       the original replica key.
     Deleting KMS keys with imported key material
       Deleting the key material of a KMS key with imported key material is temporary and reversible. 
       To restore the key, reimport its key material.
     Special considerations                                            411
      AWS Key Management Service                                                    Developer Guide
         In contrast, deleting a KMS key is irreversible. If you schedule key deletion and the required 
         waiting period expires, AWS KMS permanently and irreversibly deletes the KMS key, its key 
         material, and all metadata associated with the KMS key.
         However, the risk and consequence of deleting a KMS key with imported key material depends 
         on the type ("key spec") of the KMS key.
         • Symmetric encryption keys — If you delete a symmetric encryption KMS key, all remaining 
           ciphertexts encrypted by that key are unrecoverable. You cannot create a new symmetric 
           encryption KMS key that can decrypt the ciphertexts of a deleted symmetric encryption 
           KMS key, even if you have the same key material. Metadata unique to each KMS key is 
           cryptographically bound to each symmetric ciphertext. This security feature guarantees that 
           only the KMS key that encrypted the symmetric ciphertext can decrypt it, but it prevents you 
           from recreating an equivalent KMS key.
         • Asymmetric and HMAC keys — If you have the original key material, you can create a new 
           KMS key with the same cryptographic properties as an asymmetric or HMAC KMS key that 
           was deleted. AWS KMS generates standard RSA ciphertexts and signatures, ECC signatures, 
           and HMAC tags, which do not include any unique security features. Also, you can use an 
           HMAC key or the private key of an asymmetric key pair outside of AWS.
           A new KMS key that you create with the same asymmetric or HMAC key material will have 
           a diﬀerent key identiﬁer. You will have to create a new key policy, recreate any aliases, and 
           update existing IAM policies and grants to refer to the new key.
      Deleting KMS keys from an AWS CloudHSM key stores
         When you schedule deletion of a KMS key from an AWS CloudHSM key store, its key state
         changes to Pending deletion. The KMS key remains in the Pending deletion state throughout 
         the waiting period, even if the KMS key becomes unavailable because you have disconnected 
         the custom key store. This allows you to cancel the deletion of the KMS key at any time during 
         the waiting period.
         When the waiting period expires, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key from AWS KMS. Then AWS KMS 
         makes a best eﬀort to delete the key material from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. If 
         AWS KMS cannot delete the key material, such as when the key store is disconnected from AWS 
         KMS, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster.
         AWS KMS does not delete the key material from cluster backups. Even if you delete the KMS key 
         from AWS KMS and delete its key material from your AWS CloudHSM cluster, clusters created 
         from backups might contain the deleted key material. To permanently delete the key material, 
      Special considerations                                                               412
      AWS Key Management Service                                                  Developer Guide
         use the DescribeKey operation to identify the creation date of the KMS key. Then delete all 
         cluster backups that might contain the key material.
         When you schedule the deletion of a KMS key from an AWS CloudHSM key store, the KMS key 
         becomes unusable right away (subject to eventual consistency). However, resources encrypted 
         with data keys protected by the KMS key are not aﬀected until the KMS key is used again, such 
         to decrypt the data key. This issue aﬀects AWS services, many of which use data keys to protect 
         your resources. For details, see How unusable KMS keys aﬀect data keys.
      Deleting KMS keys from an external key store
         Deleting a KMS key from an external key store has no eﬀect on the external key that served as 
         its key material.
         When you schedule deletion of a KMS key from an external key store, its key state changes to
         Pending deletion. The KMS key remains in the Pending deletion state throughout the waiting 
         period, even if the KMS key becomes unavailable because you have disconnected the external 
         key store. This allows you to cancel the deletion of the KMS key at any time during the waiting 
         period. When the waiting period expires, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key from AWS KMS.
         When you schedule the deletion of a KMS key from an external key store, the KMS key becomes 
         unusable right away (subject to eventual consistency). However, resources encrypted with data 
         keys protected by the KMS key are not aﬀected until the KMS key is used again, such to decrypt 
         the data key. This issue aﬀects AWS services, many of which use data keys to protect your 
         resources. For details, see How unusable KMS keys aﬀect data keys.
      Control access to key deletion
      If you use IAM policies to allow AWS KMS permissions, IAM identities that have AWS administrator 
      access ("Action": "*") or AWS KMS full access ("Action": "kms:*") are already allowed to 
      schedule and cancel key the deletion of KMS keys. To allow key administrators to schedule and 
      cancel key deletion in the key policy, use the AWS KMS console or the AWS KMS API.
      Typically, only key administrators have permission to schedule or cancel key deletion. However, you 
      can give these permissions to other IAM identities by adding the kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion
      and kms:CancelKeyDeletion permission to the key policy or an IAM policy. You can also 
      use the kms:ScheduleKeyDeletionPendingWindowInDays condition key to further 
      constrain the values that principals can specify in the PendingWindowInDays parameter of a
      ScheduleKeyDeletion request.
      Control access to key deletion                                                      413

      Allow key administrators to schedule and cancel key deletion
      Using the AWS KMS console
      To give key administrators permission to schedule and cancel key deletion.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
      4.  Choose the alias or key ID of the KMS key whose permissions you want to change.
      5.  Choose the key policy tab.
      6.  The next step diﬀers for the default view and policy view of your key policy. Default view is 
          available only if you are using the default console key policy. Otherwise, only policy view is 
          available.
          When default view is available, a Switch to policy view or Switch to default view button 
          appears on the Key policy tab.
          •   In default view:
              •   Under Key deletion, choose Allow key administrators to delete this key.
          •   In policy view:
              a.  Choose Edit.
              b.

      Schedule key deletion
      The following procedures describe how to schedule key deletion and cancel key deletion of AWS 
      KMS keys (KMS keys) in AWS KMS using the AWS Management Console and the AWS KMS API.
           Warning
           Deleting a KMS key is destructive and potentially dangerous. You should proceed only when 
           you are sure that you don't need to use the KMS key anymore and won't need to use it in 
           the future. If you are not sure, you should disable the KMS key instead of deleting it.
      Before you can delete a KMS key, you must have permission to do so. For information about giving 
      these permissions to key administrators, see Control access to key deletion. You can also use the
      kms:ScheduleKeyDeletionPendingWindowInDays condition key to further constrain the 
      waiting period, such as enforcing a minimum waiting period.
      AWS KMS records an entry in your AWS CloudTrail log when you schedule deletion of the KMS key 
      and when the KMS key is actually deleted.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      In the AWS Management Console, you can schedule and cancel the deletion of multiple KMS keys 
      at one time.
      To schedule key deletion
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
          You cannot schedule the deletion of AWS managed keys or AWS owned keys.
      4.  Choose the checkbox next to the KMS key that you want to delete.
      Schedule key deletion                                                                   416
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      5.  Choose Key actions, Schedule key deletion.
      6.  Read and consider the warning, and the information about canceling the deletion during the 
          waiting period. If you decide to cancel the deletion, at the bottom of the page, choose Cancel.
      7.  For Waiting period (in days), enter a number of days between 7 and 30.
      8.  Review the KMS keys that you are deleting.
      9.
          Choose the check box next to Conﬁrm you want to schedule this key for deletion in <number 
          of days> days..
      10. Choose Schedule deletion.
      The KMS key status changes to Pending deletion.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      Use the aws kms schedule-key-deletion command to schedule key deletion of a customer 
      managed key, as shown in the following example.
      You cannot schedule the deletion of an AWS managed key or AWS owned key.
        $ aws kms schedule-key-deletion --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab --
        pending-window-in-days 10
      When used successfully, the AWS CLI returns output like the output shown in the following 
      example:
        { 
            "KeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-
        west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",

            "KeyState": "PendingDeletion", 
            "PendingWindowInDays": 10
        }
      Cancel key deletion
      After you schedule a KMS key for deletion, you can cancel the key deletion while it is still in the
      pending deletion state. You can cancel key deletion in the AWS KMS console or by using the
      CancelKeyDeletion operation. After you cancel the pending deletion of a KMS key, the key state of 
      Cancel key deletion                                                                     417

      the KMS key is Disabled. For more information on enabling the KMS key, see Enable and disable 
      keys.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      To cancel key deletion
      1.  Open the AWS KMS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
      4.  Choose the check box next to the KMS key that you want to recover.
      5.  Choose Key actions, Cancel key deletion.
      The KMS key status changes from Pending deletion to Disabled. To use the KMS key, you must
      enable it.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      Use the aws kms cancel-key-deletion command to cancel key deletion from the AWS CLI as 
      shown in the following example.
        $ aws kms cancel-key-deletion --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
      When used successfully, the AWS CLI returns output like the output shown in the following 
      example:
        { 
            "KeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-
        west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
        }
      The status of the KMS key changes from Pending Deletion to Disabled. To use the KMS key, you 
      must enable it.
      Create an alarm that detects use of a KMS key pending deletion
      You can combine the features of AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and Amazon Simple 
      Notiﬁcation Service (Amazon SNS) to create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that notiﬁes you 
      Create an alarm                                                                         418
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      when someone in your account tries to use a KMS key that is pending deletion. If you receive this 
      notiﬁcation, you might want to cancel deletion of the KMS key and reconsider your decision to 
      delete it.
      The following procedures create an alarm that notiﬁes you whenever the "Key ARN is pending 
      deletion" error message is written to your CloudTrail log ﬁles. This error message indicates 
      that a person or application tried to use the KMS key in a cryptographic operation. Because the 
      notiﬁcation is linked to the error message, it is not triggered when you use API operations that are 
      permitted on KMS keys that are pending deletion, such as ListKeys, CancelKeyDeletion, and
      PutKeyPolicy. To see a list of the AWS KMS API operations that return this error message, see
      Key states of AWS KMS keys.
      The notiﬁcation email that you receive does not list the KMS key or the cryptographic operation. 
      You can ﬁnd that information in your CloudTrail log. Instead, the email reports that the alarm state 
      changed from OK to Alarm. For more information about CloudWatch alarms and state changes, 
      see Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
           Warning
           This Amazon CloudWatch alarm cannot detect use of the public key of an asymmetric 
           KMS key outside of AWS KMS. For details about the special risks of deleting asymmetric 
           KMS keys used for public key cryptography, including creating ciphertexts that cannot be 
           decrypted, see Deleting asymmetric KMS keys.
      In this procedure, you create a CloudWatch log group metric ﬁlter that ﬁnds instances of the 
      pending deletion exception. Then, you create a CloudWatch alarm based on the log group metric. 
      For information about log group metric ﬁlters, see Creating metrics from log events using ﬁlters in 
      the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide.
      1.  Create a CloudWatch metric ﬁlter that parses CloudTrail logs.

      After you complete this procedure, you will receive a notiﬁcation each time your new CloudWatch 
      alarm enters the ALARM state. If you receive a notiﬁcation for this alarm, it might mean that a KMS 
      key that is scheduled for deletion is still needed to encrypt or decrypt data. In that case, cancel 
      deletion of the KMS key and reconsider your decision to delete it.
      Determine past usage of a KMS key
      Before deleting a KMS key, you might want to know how many ciphertexts were encrypted under 
      that key. AWS KMS does not store this information, and does not store any of the ciphertexts.

          Warning
          These strategies for determining past and actual usage are eﬀective only for AWS users and 
          AWS KMS operations. They cannot detect use of the public key of an asymmetric KMS key 
          outside of AWS KMS. For details about the special risks of deleting asymmetric KMS keys

      Examine KMS key permissions to determine the scope of potential 
      usage
      Determining who or what currently has access to a KMS key might help you determine how widely 
      the KMS key was used and whether it is still needed. To learn how to determine who or what 
      currently has access to a KMS key, go to Determining access to AWS KMS keys.
      Examine AWS CloudTrail logs to determine actual usage
      You might be able to use a KMS key usage history to help you determine whether you have 
      ciphertexts encrypted under a particular KMS key.
      All AWS KMS API activity is recorded in AWS CloudTrail log ﬁles. If you have created a CloudTrail 
      trail in the region where your KMS key is located, you can examine your CloudTrail log ﬁles to 
      view a history of all AWS KMS API activity for a particular KMS key. If you don't have a trail, you 
      can still view recent events in your CloudTrail event history. For details about how AWS KMS uses 
      CloudTrail, see Logging AWS KMS API calls with AWS CloudTrail.
      The following examples show CloudTrail log entries that are generated when a KMS key is used 
      to protect an object stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). In this example, the 
      object is uploaded to Amazon S3 using Protecting data using server-side encryption with KMS keys

      (SSE-KMS). When you upload an object to Amazon S3 with SSE-KMS, you specify the KMS key to 
      use for protecting the object. Amazon S3 uses the AWS KMS GenerateDataKey operation to request 
      a unique data key for the object, and this request event is logged in CloudTrail with an entry similar

      All AWS KMS API activity is logged by CloudTrail. By evaluating these log entries, you might be able 
      to determine the past usage of a particular KMS key, and this might help you determine whether or 
      not you want to delete it.
      To see more examples of how AWS KMS API activity appears in your CloudTrail log ﬁles, go to
      Logging AWS KMS API calls with AWS CloudTrail. For more information about CloudTrail go to the
      AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
      Delete imported key material
      You can delete the imported key material from a KMS key at any time. Also, when imported key 
      material with an expiration date expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material. In either case, when 
      the key material is deleted, the key state of the KMS key changes to Pending import, and the KMS 
      key can't be used in any cryptographic operations.
      Single-Region, symmetric encryption keys can have multiple key materials associated with them 
      and the deletion or expiration of any key material in a state other than PENDING_ROTATION
      changes the key state to Pending import. For these keys, KMS assigns a unique identiﬁer to each 
      key material. You can use the ListKeyRotations API to view these key material identiﬁers. You can 
      delete a speciﬁc key material by specifying its identiﬁer using the key-material-id parameter in 
      the DeleteImportedKeyMaterial API.
      Delete imported key material                                                            424

           Warning
           The key-material-id parameter is optional and if you do not specify it, AWS KMS will 
           delete the current key material.
      Along with disabling the KMS key and withdrawing permissions, deleting key material can be 
      used as a strategy to quickly, but temporarily, halt the use of the KMS key. In contrast, scheduling 
      the deletion of a KMS key with imported key material also quickly halts the use of the KMS key. 
      However, if the deletion is not canceled during the waiting period, the KMS key, associated key 
      materials, and all key metadata are permanently deleted. For details, see Deleting KMS keys with 
      imported key material.
      To delete key material, you can use the AWS KMS console or the DeleteImportedKeyMaterial API 
      operation. AWS KMS records an entry in your AWS CloudTrail log when you delete imported key 
      material and when AWS KMS deletes expired key material.
      How deleting key material aﬀects AWS services
         When you delete any key material, the KMS key becomes unusable right away (subject to 
         eventual consistency). However, resources encrypted with data keys protected by the KMS key 
         are not aﬀected until the KMS key is used again, such as to decrypt the data key. This issue 
         aﬀects AWS services, many of which use data keys to protect your resources. For details, see
         How unusable KMS keys aﬀect data keys.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      You can use the AWS KMS console to delete key material.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
      4.  Do one of the following:
          • Select the check box for a KMS key with imported key material. Choose Key actions, Delete 
            key material. For symmetric encryption keys that have multiple key materials associated 
            with them, this will delete the current key material.
      Delete imported key material                                                            425

          • For single-Region, symmetric encryption KMS keys with imported key material, choose the 
            alias or key ID of a KMS key. Choose the Key material and rotations tab. The key material 
            table will list all of the key materials associated with the key. Choose Delete key material
            from the Actions menu in the row corresponding to the key material you want to delete.
      5.  Conﬁrm that you want to delete the key material and then choose Delete key material. The 
          KMS key's status, which corresponds to its key state, changes to Pending import. If the deleted 
          key material was in PENDING_ROTATION state, there is no change to the KMS key's status.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To use the AWS KMS API to delete key material, send a DeleteImportedKeyMaterial request. The 
      following example shows how to do this with the AWS CLI.
      Replace 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab with the key ID of the KMS key whose key 
      material you want to delete. You can use the KMS key's key ID or ARN but you cannot use an alias 
      for this operation. The following command deletes the current key material which may be the only 
      key material associated with the key.
        $ aws kms delete-imported-key-material --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
      To delete a speciﬁc key material, specify the key material identiﬁed using the key-material-id
      parameter. Replace
      123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0 with the 
      identiﬁer of the key material you want to delete.
        $ aws kms delete-imported-key-material --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
            --key-material-id 123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0
            
      Delete imported key material                                                            426

     Generate data keys
     Data keys are symmetric keys you can use to encrypt data, including large amounts of data and 
     other data encryption keys. Unlike symmetric KMS keys, which can't be downloaded, data keys are 
     returned to you for use outside of AWS KMS.
     When AWS KMS generates data keys, it returns a plaintext data key for immediate use (optional) 
     and an encrypted copy of the data key that you can safely store with the data. When you are ready 
     to decrypt the data, you ﬁrst ask AWS KMS to decrypt the encrypted data key.
     AWS KMS generates, encrypts, and decrypts data keys. However, AWS KMS does not store, manage, 
     or track your data keys, or perform cryptographic operations with data keys. You must use and 
     manage data keys outside of AWS KMS. For help using the data keys securely, see the AWS 
     Encryption SDK.

     Create a data key
     To create a data key, call the GenerateDataKey operation. AWS KMS generates the data key. Then 
     it encrypts a copy of the data key under a symmetric encryption KMS key that you specify. The 
     operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key and the copy of the data key encrypted under 
     the KMS key. The following image shows this operation.

     AWS KMS also supports the GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext operation, which returns only an 
     encrypted data key. When you need to use the data key, ask AWS KMS to decrypt it.
     How cryptographic operations with data keys work
     The following topics explain how data keys generated by a GenerateDataKey or
     GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext operation work.
     Encrypt data with a data key
     AWS KMS cannot use a data key to encrypt data. But you can use the data key outside of AWS KMS, 
     such as by using OpenSSL or a cryptographic library like the AWS Encryption SDK.
     How cryptographic operations with data keys work                     428
     AWS Key Management Service                                     Developer Guide
     After using the plaintext data key to encrypt data, remove it from memory as soon as possible. You 
     can safely store the encrypted data key with the encrypted data so it is available to decrypt the 
     data.
     Decrypt data with a data key
     To decrypt your data, pass the encrypted data key to the Decrypt operation. AWS KMS uses your 
     KMS key to decrypt the data key and then returns the plaintext data key. Use the plaintext data key 
     to decrypt your data and then remove the plaintext data key from memory as soon as possible.
     The following diagram shows how to use the Decrypt operation to decrypt an encrypted data key.

     How unusable KMS keys aﬀect data keys
     When a KMS key becomes unusable, the eﬀect is almost immediate (subject to eventual 
     consistency). The key state of the KMS key changes to reﬂect its new condition, and all requests to 
     use the KMS key in cryptographic operations fail.
     However, the eﬀect on data keys encrypted by the KMS key, and on data encrypted by the data key, 
     is delayed until the KMS key is used again, such as to decrypt the data key.
     KMS keys can become unusable for a variety of reasons, including the following actions that you 
     might perform.
     • Disabling the KMS key
     • Scheduling the KMS key for deletion
     • Deleting the key material from a KMS key with imported key material, or allowing the imported 
       key material to expire. If a KMS key with EXTERNAL origin has multiple key materials associated, 
       the deletion or expiration of any key material will cause the key to become unusable.
     • Disconnecting the AWS CloudHSM key store that hosts the KMS key, or deleting the key from the 
       AWS CloudHSM cluster that serves as key material for the KMS key.
     How unusable KMS keys aﬀect data keys                             430
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     • Disconnecting the external key store that hosts the KMS key, or any other action that interferes 
       with encryption and decryption requests to the external key store proxy, including deleting the 
       external key from its external key manager.
     This eﬀect is particularly important for the many AWS services that use data keys to protect 
     the resources that the service manages. The following example uses Amazon Elastic Block Store 
     (Amazon EBS) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). Diﬀerent AWS services use data 
     keys in diﬀerent ways. For details, see the Data protection section of the Security chapter for the 
     AWS service.
     For example, consider this scenario:
     1. You create an encrypted EBS volume and specify a KMS key to protect it. Amazon EBS asks AWS 
       KMS to use your KMS key to generate an encrypted data key for the volume. Amazon EBS stores 
       the encrypted data key with the volume's metadata.
     2. When you attach the EBS volume to an EC2 instance, Amazon EC2 uses your KMS key to decrypt 
       the EBS volume's encrypted data key. Amazon EC2 uses the data key in the Nitro hardware, 
       which is responsible for encrypting all disk I/O to the EBS volume. The data key persists in the 
       Nitro hardware while the EBS volume is attached to the EC2 instance.
     3. You perform an action that makes the KMS key unusable. This has no immediate eﬀect on the 
       EC2 instance or the EBS volume. Amazon EC2 uses the data key—not the KMS key—to encrypt 
       all disk I/O while the volume is attached to the instance.
     4. However, when the encrypted EBS volume is detached from the EC2 instance, Amazon EBS 
       removes the data key from the Nitro hardware. The next time the encrypted EBS volume is 
       attached to an EC2 instance, the attachment fails, because Amazon EBS cannot use the KMS key 
       to decrypt the volume's encrypted data key. To use the EBS volume again, you must make the 
       KMS key usable again.

      Generate data key pairs
      An asymmetric KMS key represents a data key pair. Data key pairs are asymmetric data keys 
      consisting of a mathematically-related public key and private key. They are designed for use in 
      client-side encryption and decryption, signing and veriﬁcation outside of AWS KMS, or to establish 
      a shared secret between two peers.
      Unlike the data key pairs that tools like OpenSSL generate, AWS KMS protects the private key 
      in each data key pair under a symmetric encryption KMS key in AWS KMS that you specify. 
      However, AWS KMS does not store, manage, or track your data key pairs, or perform cryptographic 
      operations with data key pairs. You must use and manage data key pairs outside of AWS KMS.
      Topics
      • Create a data key pair
      • How cryptographic operations with data key pairs work
      Create a data key pair
      To create a data key pair, call the GenerateDataKeyPair or GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext
      operations. Specify the symmetric encryption KMS key you want to use to encrypt the private key.
      GenerateDataKeyPair returns a plaintext public key, a plaintext private key, and an encrypted 
      private key. Use this operation when you need a plaintext private key immediately, such as to 
      generate a digital signature.
      GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext returns a plaintext public key and an encrypted 
      private key, but not a plaintext private key. Use this operation when you don't need a plaintext 
      private key immediately, such as when you're encrypting with a public key. Later, when you need a 
      plaintext private key to decrypt the data, you can call the Decrypt operation.
      The following image shows the GenerateDataKeyPair operation. The
      GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operation omits the plaintext private key.

     Encrypt data with a data key pair
     When you encrypt with a data key pair, you use the public key of the pair to encrypt the data and 
     the private key of the same pair to decrypt the data. Typically, you use data key pairs when many 
     parties need to encrypt data that only the party with the private key can decrypt.
     The parties with the public key use that key to encrypt data, as shown in the following diagram.
     Decrypt data with a data key pair
     To decrypt your data, use the private key in the data key pair. For the operation to succeed, 
     the public and private keys must be from the same data key pair, and you must use the same 
     encryption algorithm.
     To decrypt the encrypted private key, pass it to the Decrypt operation. Use the plaintext private key 
     to decrypt the data. Then remove the plaintext private key from memory as soon as possible.
     The following diagram shows how to use the private key in a data key pair to decrypt ciphertext.

     Sign messages with a data key pair
     To generate a cryptographic signature for a message, use the private key in the data key pair. 
     Anyone with the public key can use it to verify that the message was signed with your private key 
     and that it has not changed since it was signed.
     If you encrypt your private key, pass the encrypted private key to the Decrypt operation. AWS 
     KMS uses your KMS key to decrypt the data key and then it returns the plaintext private key. Use 
     the plaintext private key to generate the signature. Then remove the plaintext private key from 
     memory as soon as possible.
     To sign a message, create a message digest using a cryptographic hash function, such as the dgst
     command in OpenSSL. Then, pass your plaintext private key to the signing algorithm. The result 
     is a signature that represents the contents of the message. (You might be able to sign shorter 
     messages without ﬁrst creating a digest. The maximum message size varies with the signing tool 
     you use.)
     The following diagram shows how to use the private key in a data key pair to sign a message.

      Verify a signature with a data key pair
      Anyone who has the public key in your data key pair can use it to verify the signature that you 
      generated with your private key. Veriﬁcation conﬁrms that an authorized user signed the message 
      with the speciﬁed private key and signing algorithm, and the message hasn't changed since it was 
      signed.
      To be successful, the party verifying the signature must generate the same type of digest, use 
      the same algorithm, and use the public key that corresponds to the private key used to sign the 
      message.
      The following diagram shows how to use the public key in a data key pair to verify a message 
      signature.

      Derive a shared secret with data key pairs
      Key agreement enables two peers, each having an elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish 
      a shared secret over an insecure channel. To derive a shared secret, the two peers must exchange 
      their public keys over the insecure communication channel (like the internet). Then, each party 
      uses their private key and their peer's public key to calculate the same shared secret using a key 
      agreement algorithm. You can use the shared secret value to derive a symmetric key that can 
      encrypt and decrypt data that is sent between the two peers, or that can generate and verify 
      HMACs.
          Note
          AWS KMS strongly recommends verifying that the public key you receive came from the 
          expected party before using it to derive a shared secret.

      Perform oﬄine operations with public keys
      In an asymmetric KMS key, the private key is created in AWS KMS and never leaves AWS KMS 
      unencrypted. To use the private key, you must call AWS KMS. You can use the public key within 
      AWS KMS by calling the AWS KMS API operations. Or, you can download the public key and share 
      for use outside of AWS KMS.
      You might share a public key to let others encrypt data outside of AWS KMS that you can decrypt 
      only with your private key. Or, to allow others to verify a digital signature outside of AWS KMS 
      that you have generated with your private key. Or, to share your public key with a peer to derive a 
      shared secret.
      When you use the public key in your asymmetric KMS key within AWS KMS, you beneﬁt from the 
      authentication, authorization, and logging that are part of every AWS KMS operation. You also 
      reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These features are not eﬀective outside 
      of AWS KMS. For details, see Special considerations for downloading public keys.

      Special considerations for downloading public keys

      detailed logs of every operation. AWS KMS also allows you to prevent the use of KMS keys,

      temporarily or permanently. Finally, AWS KMS operations are designed to minimize of risk 
      of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These features are not available when you use 
      downloaded public keys outside of AWS KMS.
      Authorization
         Key policies and IAM policies that control access to the KMS key within AWS KMS have no eﬀect 
         on operations performed outside of AWS. Any user who can get the public key can use it outside 
         of AWS KMS even if they don't have permission to encrypt data or verify signatures with the 
         KMS key.
      Key usage restrictions
         Key usage restrictions are not eﬀective outside of AWS KMS. If you call the Encrypt operation 
         with a KMS key that has a KeyUsage of SIGN_VERIFY, the AWS KMS operation fails. But if 
         you encrypt data outside of AWS KMS with a public key from a KMS key with a KeyUsage of
         SIGN_VERIFY or KEY_AGREEMENT, the data cannot be decrypted.
      Algorithm restrictions
         Restrictions on the encryption and signing algorithms that AWS KMS supports are not eﬀective 
         outside of AWS KMS. If you encrypt data with the public key from a KMS key outside of AWS 
         KMS, and use an encryption algorithm that AWS KMS does not support, the data cannot be 
         decrypted.
      Disabling and deleting KMS keys
         Actions that you can take to prevent the use of KMS key in a cryptographic operation within 
         AWS KMS do not prevent anyone from using the public key outside of AWS KMS. For example, 
         disabling a KMS key, scheduling deletion of a KMS key, deleting a KMS key, or deleting the key 
         material from a KMS key have no eﬀect on a public key outside of AWS KMS. If you delete an 
         asymmetric KMS key or delete or lose its key material, data that you encrypt with a public key 
         outside of AWS KMS is unrecoverable.
      Logging
         AWS CloudTrail logs that record every AWS KMS operation, including the request, response, 
         date, time, and authorized user, do not record the use of the public key outside of AWS KMS.
      Oﬄine veriﬁcation with SM2 key pairs (China Regions only)
         To verify a signature outside of AWS KMS with an SM2 public key, you must specify the 
         distinguishing ID. By default, AWS KMS uses 1234567812345678 as the distinguishing ID. For 
         more information, see Oﬄine veriﬁcation with SM2 key pairs (China Regions only).

      Download public key
      You can download the public key from an asymmetric KMS key pair in the AWS KMS console or by 
      using the GetPublicKey operation. To download the public key, you must have kms:GetPublicKey
      permission on the asymmetric KMS key.
      The public key that AWS KMS returns is a DER-encoded X.509 public key, also known as
      SubjectPublicKeyInfo (SPKI), as deﬁned in RFC 5280. When you use the HTTP API or the AWS 
      CLI, the value is Base64-encoded. Otherwise, it is not Base64-encoded.
      To download the public key from an asymmetric KMS key pair, you need kms:GetPublicKey
      permissions. For more information about AWS KMS permissions, see the Permissions reference.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      You can use the AWS Management Console to view, copy, and download the public key from an 
      asymmetric KMS key in your AWS account. To download the public key from an asymmetric KMS 
      key in diﬀerent AWS account, use the AWS KMS API.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.
      4.  Choose the alias or key ID of an asymmetric KMS key.
      5.  Choose the Cryptographic conﬁguration tab. Record the values of the Key spec, Key usage, 
          and Encryption algorithms or Signing Algorithms ﬁelds. You'll need to use these values to 
          use the public key outside of AWS KMS. Be sure to share this information when you share the

      usage and encryption algorithms. Be sure to save these values and share them whenever you share 
      the public key.
      The examples in this section use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any 
      supported programming language.
      To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, 
      preﬁx it with alias/. To specify a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use its key ARN or 
      alias ARN.
      Before running this command, replace the example alias name with a valid identiﬁer for the KMS 
      key. To run this command, you must have kms:GetPublicKey permissions on the KMS key.

      Example oﬄine operations
      After downloading the public key of your asymmetric KMS key pair, you can share it with others 
      and use it to perform oﬄine operations.
      AWS CloudTrail logs that record every AWS KMS operation, including the request, response, date, 
      time, and authorized user, do not record the use of the public key outside of AWS KMS.
      This topic provides example oﬄine operations and details the tools AWS KMS provides to make 
      oﬄine operations easier.

      Deriving shared secrets oﬄine
      You can download the public key of your ECC key pair for use in oﬄine operations, that is, 
      operations outside of AWS KMS.
      The following OpenSSL walkthrough demonstrates one method of deriving a shared secret outside 
      of AWS KMS using the public key of an ECC KMS key pair and a private key created with OpenSSL.
      1. Create an ECC key pair in OpenSSL and prepare it for use with AWS KMS.
          // Create an ECC key pair in OpenSSL and save the private key in 
           openssl_ecc_key_priv.pem
          export OPENSSL_CURVE_NAME="P-256"
          export KMS_CURVE_NAME="ECC_NIST_P256"
          export OPENSSL_KEY1_PRIV_PEM="openssl_ecc_key1_priv.pem"
          openssl ecparam -name ${OPENSSL_CURVE_NAME} -genkey -out ${OPENSSL_KEY1_PRIV_PEM}     
                           
                               
          // Derive the public key from the private key                     
          export OPENSSL_KEY1_PUB_PEM="openssl_ecc_key1_pub.pem"
          openssl ec -in ${OPENSSL_KEY1_PRIV_PEM} -pubout -outform pem \ 
              -out ${OPENSSL_KEY1_PUB_PEM}                     
                               
          // View the PEM file containing the public key and extract the public key as a  
          // Base64 encoded string into OPENSSL_KEY1_PUB_BASE64 for use with AWS KMS
          export OPENSSL_KEY1_PUB_BASE64=`cat ${OPENSSL_KEY1_PUB_PEM} | \ 
              tee /dev/stderr | grep -v "PUBLIC KEY" | tr -d "\n"`
      2. Create an ECC key agreement key pair in AWS KMS and prepare it for use with OpenSSL.
          // Create a KMS key on the same curve as the key pair from step 1  
          // with a key usage of KEY_AGREEMENT
          // Save its ARN in KMS_KEY1_ARN.
          export KMS_KEY1_ARN=`aws kms create-key --key-spec ${KMS_CURVE_NAME} \ 
              --key-usage KEY_AGREEMENT | tee /dev/stderr | jq -r .KeyMetadata.Arn`
          // Download the public key and save the Base64-encoded version in KMS_KEY1_PUB_BASE64

              tee /dev/stderr | jq -r .PublicKey`                     
                               
          // Create a PEM file for the public KMS key for use with OpenSSL    
          export KMS_KEY1_PUB_PEM="aws_kms_ecdh_key1_pub.pem"
          echo "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----" > ${KMS_KEY1_PUB_PEM}
          echo ${KMS_KEY1_PUB_BASE64} | fold -w 64 >> ${KMS_KEY1_PUB_PEM}
          echo "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" >> ${KMS_KEY1_PUB_PEM}
      3. Derive shared secret in OpenSSL using the private key in OpenSSL and the public KMS key.
          export OPENSSL_SHARED_SECRET1_BIN="openssl_shared_secret1.bin"
          openssl pkeyutl -derive -inkey ${OPENSSL_KEY1_PRIV_PEM} \ 
              -peerkey ${KMS_KEY1_PUB_PEM} -out ${OPENSSL_SHARED_SECRET1_BIN}
      Oﬄine veriﬁcation with ML-DSA key pairs
      AWS KMS supports a hedged variant of ML-DSA signing, as described in Federal Information 
      Processing Standards (FIPS) 204 standard section 3.4 for messages up to 4 KB bytes.
      To sign messages larger than 4 KB, you perform the message pre-processing step outside of AWS 
      KMS. This hashing step creates a 64-byte message representative μ, as deﬁned in NIST FIPS 204, 
      section 6.2.
      AWS KMS has a message type called EXTERNAL_MU for messages larger than 4 KB. When you use 
      this instead of the RAW message type, AWS KMS:
      • Assumes you've already performed the hashing step
      • Skips its internal hashing process
      • Works with messages of any size
      When you verify a message, the method that you use depends on the size restriction of the 
      external system or library and whether it supports the 64-byte message representative μ:
      •
        If the message is smaller than the size restriction, use the RAW message type.
      • If the message is larger than the size restriction, use the representative μ in the external system.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      The following sections demonstrate how to sign messages using AWS KMS and verify messages 
      using OpenSSL. We provide examples for both messages under and over the 4 KB message size 
      limit imposed by AWS KMS. OpenSSL doesn't impose a limit on message size for veriﬁcation.
      For both examples, ﬁrst get the public key from AWS KMS. Use the following AWS CLI command:
        aws kms get-public-key \ 
            --key-id _<1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>_ \ 
            --output text \ 
            --query PublicKey | base64 --decode > public_key.der
      Message size less than 4KB
      For messages under 4 KB, use the RAW message type with AWS KMS. While you can use
      EXTERNAL_MU, it isn't necessary for messages within the size limit.
      Use the following AWS CLI command to sign the message:
        aws kms sign \ 
            --key-id _<1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>_ \ 
            --message 'your message' \ 
            --message-type RAW \ 
            --signing-algorithm ML_DSA_SHAKE_256 \ 
            --output text \ 
            --query Signature | base64 --decode > ExampleSignature.bin
      To verify this message using OpenSSL use the following command:
        echo -n 'your message' | ./openssl dgst -verify public_key.der -signature 
         ExampleSignature.bin
      Message size more than 4KB
      To sign messages larger than 4KB, use the EXTERNAL_MU message type. When you use
      EXTERNAL_MU, you pre-hash the message externally to a 64-byte representative μ as deﬁned 
      in NIST FIPS 204 section 6.2 and pass it to the signing or verifying operations. Note that this is 
      diﬀerent from the "Pre-hash MLDSA" or HashML-DSA deﬁned in NIST FIPS 204 section 5.4.
      1.  First, construct a message preﬁx. The preﬁx contains a domain separator, the length of any 
          context, and the context. The default for the domain separator and context length is zero.
      2.  Prepend the message preﬁx to the message.

      3.  Use SHAKE256 to hash the public key and prepend it to the result of step 2.
      4.
          Finally, hash the result of step 3 to produce a 64-byte EXTERNAL_MU.
      The following example uses OpenSSL 3.5 to construct the EXTERNAL_MU:
        { 
            openssl asn1parse -inform DER -in public_key.der -strparse 17 -noout -out - 2>/dev/
        null | 
            openssl dgst -provider default -shake256 -xoflen 64 -binary; 
            printf '\x00\x00'; 
            echo -n "your message"
        } | openssl dgst -provider default -shake256 -xoflen 64 -binary > mu.bin
      After you create the mu.bin ﬁle, call the AWS KMS API with the following command to sign the 
      message:
        aws kms sign \ 
            --key-id _<1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>_ \ 
            --message fileb://mu.bin \ 
            --message-type EXTERNAL_MU \ 
            --signing-algorithm ML_DSA_SHAKE_256 \ 
            --output text \ 
            --query Signature | base64 --decode > ExampleSignature.bin
      The resulting signature is the same as a RAW signature on the original message. You can use the 
      same OpenSSL 3.5 command to verify the message:
        echo -n 'your message' | ./openssl dgst -verify public_key.der -signature 
         ExampleSignature.bin
      Oﬄine veriﬁcation with SM2 key pairs (China Regions only)
      To verify a signature outside of AWS KMS with an SM2 public key, you must specify the 
      distinguishing ID. When you pass a raw message, MessageType:RAW, to the Sign API, AWS KMS 
      uses the default distinguishing ID, 1234567812345678, deﬁned by OSCCA in GM/T 0009-2012. 
      You cannot specify your own distinguishing ID within AWS KMS.
      However, if you are generating a message digest outside of AWS, you can specify your own 
      distinguishing ID, then pass the message digest, MessageType:DIGEST, to AWS KMS to sign. To 
      Oﬄine veriﬁcation with SM2 key pairs (China Regions only)                               445
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      do this, change the DEFAULT_DISTINGUISHING_ID value in the SM2OfflineOperationHelper
      class. The distinguishing ID you specify can be any string up to 8,192 characters long. After 
      AWS KMS signs the message digest, you need either the message digest or the message and the 
      distinguishing ID used to compute the digest to verify it oﬄine.
           Important
           The SM2OfflineOperationHelper reference code is designed to be compatible with
           Bouncy Castle version 1.68. For help with other versions, contact bouncycastle.org.
      SM2OfflineOperationHelper class
      To help you with oﬄine operations with SM2 keys, the SM2OfflineOperationHelper class for 
      Java has methods that perform the tasks for you. You can use this helper class as a model for other 
      cryptographic providers.
      Within AWS KMS, the raw ciphertext conversions and SM2DSA message digest calculations occur 
      automatically. Not all cryptographic providers implement SM2 in the same way. Some libraries, like
      OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and later, perform these actions automatically. AWS KMS conﬁrmed this 
      behavior in testing with OpenSSL version 3.0. Use the following SM2OfflineOperationHelper
      class with libraries, like Bouncy Castle, that require you to perform these conversions and 
      calculations manually.
      The SM2OfflineOperationHelper class provides methods for the following oﬄine operations:
      • Message digest calculation
           To generate a message digest oﬄine that you can use for oﬄine veriﬁcation, or 
           that you can pass to AWS KMS to sign, use the calculateSM2Digest method. The
           calculateSM2Digest method generates a message digest with the SM3 hashing 
           algorithm. The GetPublicKey API returns your public key in binary format. You must parse 
           the binary key into a Java PublicKey. Provide the parsed public key with the message. 
           The method automatically combines your message with the default distinguishing 
           ID, 1234567812345678, but you can set your own distinguishing ID by changing the
           DEFAULT_DISTINGUISHING_ID value.

      • Verify
           To verify a signature oﬄine, use the offlineSM2DSAVerify method. The
           offlineSM2DSAVerify method uses the message digest calculated from the speciﬁed 
           distinguishing ID, and original message you provide to verify the digital signature. The
           GetPublicKey API returns your public key in binary format. You must parse the binary key into 
           a Java PublicKey. Provide the parsed public key with the original message and the signature 
           you want to verify. For more details, see  Oﬄine veriﬁcation with SM2 key pairs.
      • Encrypt
           To encrypt plaintext oﬄine, use the offlineSM2PKEEncrypt method. This method ensures 
           the ciphertext is in a format AWS KMS can decrypt. The offlineSM2PKEEncrypt method 
           encrypts the plaintext, and then converts the raw ciphertext produced by SM2PKE to the 
           ASN.1 format. The GetPublicKey API returns your public key in binary format. You must parse 
           the binary key into a Java PublicKey. Provide the parsed public key with the plaintext that you 
           want to encrypt.
           If you're unsure whether you need to perform the conversion, use the following OpenSSL 
           operation to test the format of your ciphertext. If the operation fails, you need to convert the 
           ciphertext to the ASN.1 format.
             openssl asn1parse -inform DER -in ciphertext.der
      By default, the SM2OfflineOperationHelper class uses the default distinguishing ID,
      1234567812345678, when generating message digests for SM2DSA operations.

      Monitor AWS KMS keys
      Monitoring is an important part of understanding the availability, state, and usage of your AWS 
      KMS keys in AWS KMS and maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of your AWS 
      solutions. Collecting monitoring data from all the parts of your AWS solution will help you debug 
      a multipoint failure if one occurs. Before you start monitoring your KMS keys, however, create a 
      monitoring plan that includes answers to the following questions:
      • What are your monitoring goals?
      • What resources will you monitor?
      • How often will you monitor these resources?
      • What monitoring tools will you use?
      • Who will perform the monitoring tasks?
      • Who should be notiﬁed when something happens?
      The next step is to monitor your KMS keys over time to establish a baseline for normal AWS KMS 
      usage and expectations in your environment. As you monitor your KMS keys, store historical 
      monitoring data so that you can compare it with current data, identify normal patterns and 
      anomalies, and devise methods to address issues.
      For example, you can monitor AWS KMS API activity and events that aﬀect your KMS keys. When 
      data falls above or below your established norms, you might need to investigate or take corrective 
      action.
      To establish a baseline for normal patterns, monitor the following items:
      • AWS KMS API activity for data plane operations. These are cryptographic operations that use a 
        KMS key, such as Decrypt, Encrypt, ReEncrypt, and GenerateDataKey.
      • AWS KMS API activity for control plane operations that are important to you. These operations 
        manage a KMS key, and you might want to monitor those that change a KMS key's availability 
        (such as ScheduleKeyDeletion, CancelKeyDeletion, DisableKey, EnableKey, ImportKeyMaterial, 
        and DeleteImportedKeyMaterial) or change a KMS key's access control (such as PutKeyPolicy and
        RevokeGrant).
      • Other AWS KMS metrics (such as the amount of time remaining until your imported key material
        expires) and events (such as the expiration of imported key material or the deletion or key 
        rotation of a KMS key).
                                                                                             451
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Monitoring tools
      AWS provides various tools that you can use to monitor your KMS keys. You can conﬁgure some of 
      these tools to do the monitoring for you, while some of the tools require manual intervention. We 
      recommend that you automate monitoring tasks as much as possible.
      Automated monitoring tools
      You can use the following automated monitoring tools to watch your KMS keys and report when 
      something has changed.
      • AWS CloudTrail Log Monitoring – Share log ﬁles between accounts, monitor CloudTrail log ﬁles 
        in real time by sending them to CloudWatch Logs, write log processing applications with the
        CloudTrail Processing Library, and validate that your log ﬁles have not changed after delivery by 
        CloudTrail. For more information, see Working with CloudTrail Log Files in the AWS CloudTrail 
        User Guide.
      • Amazon CloudWatch Alarms – Watch a single metric over a time period that you specify, and 
        perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over 
        a number of time periods. The action is a notiﬁcation sent to an Amazon Simple Notiﬁcation 
        Service (Amazon SNS) topic or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch alarms do not 
        invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state; the state must have changed and 
        been maintained for a speciﬁed number of periods. For more information, see Monitor KMS keys 
        with Amazon CloudWatch.
      • Amazon EventBridge – Match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams 
        to capture state information and, if necessary, make changes or take corrective action. For more 
        information, see Monitor KMS keys with Amazon EventBridge and the Amazon EventBridge User 
        Guide.
      • Amazon CloudWatch Logs – Monitor, store, and access your log ﬁles from AWS CloudTrail or 
        other sources. For more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide.
      Manual monitoring tools
      Another important part of monitoring KMS keys involves manually monitoring those items that the 
      CloudWatch alarms and events don't cover. The AWS KMS, CloudWatch, AWS Trusted Advisor, and 
      other AWS dashboards provide an at-a-glance view of the state of your AWS environment.
      Monitoring tools                                                                        452
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
      You can customize the AWS managed keys and Customer managed keys pages of the AWS KMS 
      console to display the following information about each KMS key:
      • Key ID
      • Status
      • Creation date
      • Expiration date (for KMS keys with imported key material)
      • Origin
      • Custom key store ID (for KMS keys in custom key stores)
      The CloudWatch console dashboard shows the following:
      • Current alarms and status
      • Graphs of alarms and resources
      • Service health status
      In addition, you can use CloudWatch to do the following:
      • Create customized dashboards to monitor the services you care about
      • Graph metric data to troubleshoot issues and discover trends
      • Search and browse all your AWS resource metrics
      • Create and edit alarms to be notiﬁed of problems
      AWS Trusted Advisor can help you monitor your AWS resources to improve performance, reliability, 
      security, and cost eﬀectiveness. Four Trusted Advisor checks are available to all users; more than 50 
      checks are available to users with a Business or Enterprise support plan. For more information, see
      AWS Trusted Advisor.
      Logging AWS KMS API calls with AWS CloudTrail
      AWS KMS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that records all calls to AWS KMS by users, 
      roles, and other AWS services. CloudTrail captures all API calls to AWS KMS as events, including 
      calls from the AWS KMS console, AWS KMS APIs, AWS CloudFormation templates, the AWS 
      Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS Tools for PowerShell.
      Logging with AWS CloudTrail                                                           453
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
      CloudTrail logs all AWS KMS operations, including read-only operations, such as ListAliases
      and GetKeyRotationStatus, operations that manage KMS keys, such as CreateKey and
      PutKeyPolicy, and cryptographic operations, such as GenerateDataKey and Decrypt. It also logs 
      internal operations that AWS KMS calls for you, such as DeleteExpiredKeyMaterial, DeleteKey,
      SynchronizeMultiRegionKey, and RotateKey.
      CloudTrail logs all successful operations and, in some scenarios, attempted calls that failed, such 
      as when the caller is denied access to a resource. Cross-account operations on KMS keys are logged 
      in both the caller account and the KMS key owner account. However, cross-account AWS KMS 
      requests that are rejected because access is denied are logged only in the caller's account.
      For security reasons, some ﬁelds are omitted from AWS KMS log entries, such as the Plaintext
      parameter of an Encrypt request, and the response to GetKeyPolicy or any cryptographic 
      operation. To make it easier to search for CloudTrail log entries for particular KMS keys, AWS KMS 
      adds the key ARN of the aﬀected KMS key to the responseElements ﬁeld in the log entries for 
      some AWS KMS key management operations, even when the API operation doesn't return the key 
      ARN.
      Although by default, all AWS KMS actions are logged as CloudTrail events, you can exclude AWS 
      KMS actions from a CloudTrail trail. For details, see Excluding AWS KMS events from a trail.

      the key ARN of the aﬀected KMS key in the responseElements.keyId element of the log entry, 
      even when the AWS KMS API operation doesn't return the key ARN.
      For example, a successful call to the DisableKey operation doesn't return any values in the 
      response, but instead of a null value, the responseElements.keyId value in the DisableKey log 
      entry includes the key ARN of the disabled KMS key.

      This feature was added in December 2022 and aﬀects the following CloudTrail log entries:
      CreateAlias, CreateGrant, DeleteAlias, DeleteKey, DisableKey, EnableKey, EnableKeyRotation,
      ImportKeyMaterial, RotateKey, SynchronizeMultiRegionKey, TagResource, UntagResource,
      UpdateAlias, and UpdatePrimaryRegion.
      Excluding AWS KMS events from a trail
      To provide a record of the use and management of their AWS KMS resources, most AWS KMS users 
      rely on the events in a CloudTrail trail. The trail can be an valuable source of data for auditing 
      critical events, such as creating, disabling, and deleting AWS KMS keys, changing key policy, 
      and the use of your KMS keys by AWS services on your behalf. In some cases, the metadata in a 
      CloudTrail log entry, such as the encryption context in an encryption operation, can help you to 
      avoid or resolve errors.
      However, because AWS KMS can generate a large number of events, AWS CloudTrail lets you 
      exclude AWS KMS events from a trail. This per-trail setting excludes all AWS KMS events; you 
      cannot exclude particular AWS KMS events.
           Warning
           Excluding AWS KMS events from a CloudTrail Log can obscure actions that use your 
           KMS keys. Be cautious when giving principals the cloudtrail:PutEventSelectors
           permission that is required to perform this operation.
      To exclude AWS KMS events from a trail:
      • In the CloudTrail console, use the Log Key Management Service events setting when you
        create a trail or update a trail. For instructions, see Logging Management Events with the AWS 
        Management Console in the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
      • In the CloudTrail API, use the PutEventSelectors operation. Add the
        ExcludeManagementEventSources attribute to your event selectors with a value of
        kms.amazonaws.com. For an example, see Example: A trail that does not log AWS Key 
        Management Service events in the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
      You can disable this exclusion at any time by changing the console setting or the event selectors 
      for a trail. The trail will then start recording AWS KMS events. However, it cannot recover AWS KMS 
      events that occurred while the exclusion was eﬀective.
      Excluding AWS KMS events from a trail                                                  456
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      When you exclude AWS KMS events by using the console or API, the resulting CloudTrail
      PutEventSelectors API operation is also logged in your CloudTrail Logs. If AWS KMS 
      events don't appear in your CloudTrail Logs, look for a PutEventSelectors event with the
      ExcludeManagementEventSources attribute set to kms.amazonaws.com.
      Examples of AWS KMS log entries
      AWS KMS writes entries to your CloudTrail log when you call an AWS KMS operation and when 
      an AWS service calls an operation on your behalf. AWS KMS also writes an entry when it calls an 
      operation for you. For example, it writes an entry when it deletes a KMS key that you scheduled for 
      deletion.

      Decrypt
      These examples show AWS CloudTrail log entries for the Decrypt operation.
      The CloudTrail log entry for a Decrypt operation always includes the encryptionAlgorithm
      in the requestParameters even if the encryption algorithm wasn't speciﬁed in the request. The 
      ciphertext in the request and the plaintext in the response are omitted.

      Decrypt failure with a standard symmetric encryption key
      The following example CloudTrail log entry records a failed Decrypt operation with a standard 
      symmetric encryption KMS key. The exception (errorCode) and error message (errorMessage) 
      are included help you to resolve the error.
      In this case, the symmetric encryption KMS key speciﬁed in the Decrypt request was not the 
      symmetric encryption KMS key that was used to encrypt the data.

      Decrypt failure with a KMS key in an external key store
      The following example CloudTrail log entry records a failed request for a Decrypt operation with 
      a KMS key in an external key store. CloudWatch logs requests that fail, in addition to successful 
      requests. When recording a failure, the CloudTrail log entry includes the exception (errorCode) and 
      the accompanying error message (errorMessage).
      If the failed request reached your external key store proxy, as in this example, you can use the
      requestId value to associate the failed request with a corresponding request your external key 
      store proxy logs, if your proxy provides them.
      For help with Decrypt requests in external key stores, see Decryption errors.

      DeleteExpiredKeyMaterial
      When you import key material into an AWS KMS key (KMS key), you can set an expiration date and 
      time for that key material. AWS KMS records an entry in your CloudTrail log when you import the 
      key material (with the expiration settings) and when AWS KMS deletes the expired key material. 
      For information about creating KMS key with imported key material, see Importing key material for 
      AWS KMS keys.
      The following example shows an AWS CloudTrail log entry generated when AWS KMS deletes the 
      expired key material.

      DeleteImportedKeyMaterial
      If you import key material into a KMS key, you can delete the imported key material at any time 
      by using the DeleteImportedKeyMaterial operation. When you delete imported key material from 
      a KMS key, the key state of the KMS key changes to PendingImport and the KMS key cannot be 
      used in any cryptographic operations. For details, see Delete imported key material.
      The following example shows an AWS CloudTrail log entry generated for the
      DeleteImportedKeyMaterial operation.

      DeleteKey
      These examples show the AWS CloudTrail log entry that is generated when a KMS key is deleted. 
      To delete a KMS key, you use the ScheduleKeyDeletion operation. After the speciﬁed waiting 
      period expires, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key and records an entry like the following one in your 
      CloudTrail log to record that event.
      CloudTrail log entries for this operation recorded on or after December 2022 include the key ARN 
      of the aﬀected KMS key in the responseElements.keyId value, even though this operation 
      does not return the key ARN.
      For an example of the CloudTrail log entry for the ScheduleKeyDeletion operation, see
      ScheduleKeyDeletion. For information about deleting KMS keys, see Delete an AWS KMS key.
      The following example CloudTrail log entry records a DeleteKey operation of a KMS key with key 
      material in AWS KMS.

      SynchronizeMultiRegionKey
      The following example shows an AWS CloudTrail log entry generated when AWS KMS synchronizes 
      a multi-Region key. Synchronizing involves cross-Region calls to copy the shared properties of a 
      multi-Region primary key to its replica keys. AWS KMS synchronizes multi-Region keys periodically 
      to assure that all related multi-Region keys have the same key material.
      The resources element of the CloudTrail log entry includes the key ARN of the multi-Region 
      primary key, including its AWS Region. The related multi-Region replica keys and their Regions are 
      not listed in this log entry.
      CloudTrail log entries for this operation recorded on or after December 2022 include the key ARN 
      of the aﬀected KMS key in the responseElements.keyId value, even though this operation 
      does not return the key ARN.

      UpdatePrimaryRegion
      The following example shows the AWS CloudTrail log entries that are generated by calling the
      UpdatePrimaryRegion operation on a multi-Region key.
      The UpdatePrimaryRegion operation writes two CloudTrail log entries: one in the Region with 
      the multi-Region primary key that is converted to a replica key, and one in the Region with a multi-
      Region replica key that is converted to a primary key.
      CloudTrail log entries for this operation recorded on or after December 2022 include the key ARN 
      of the aﬀected KMS key in the responseElements.keyId value, even though this operation 
      does not return the key ARN.
      The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry for UpdatePrimaryRegion in the Region 
      where the multi-Region key changed from a primary key to a replica key (us-west-2). The
      primaryRegion ﬁeld shows the Region that now hosts the primary key (ap-northeast-1).

      Amazon EC2 example one
      The following example records an IAM principal creating an encrypted volume using the default 
      volume key in the Amazon EC2 management console.
      The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry in which user Alice creates an encrypted 
      volume with a default volume key in the Amazon EC2 management console. The EC2 log ﬁle record 
      includes a volumeId ﬁeld with a value of "vol-13439757". The AWS KMS record contains an
      encryptionContext ﬁeld with a value of "aws:ebs:id": "vol-13439757". Similarly, the
      principalId and accountId between the two records match. The records reﬂect the fact that 
      creating an encrypted volume generates a data key that is used to encrypt the volume content.

      Amazon EC2 example two
      In the following example, an IAM principal running an Amazon EC2 instance creates and mounts 
      a data volume that is encrypted under a KMS key. This action generates multiple CloudTrail log 
      records. For more information on Amazon EBS and encryption, see Requirements for Amazon EBS 
      encryption.
      When the volume is created, Amazon EC2, acting on behalf of the customer, gets an encrypted 
      data key from AWS KMS (GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext). Then it creates a grant 
      (CreateGrant) that allows it to decrypt the data key. When the volume is mounted, Amazon EC2 
      calls AWS KMS to decrypt the data key (Decrypt).
      Examples of AWS KMS log entries                                                         533

      The instanceId of the Amazon EC2 instance, "i-81e2f56c", appears in the RunInstances
      event. The same instance ID qualiﬁes the granteePrincipal of the grant that is created 
      ("111122223333:aws:ec2-infrastructure:i-81e2f56c") and the assumed role that is 
      the principal in the Decrypt call ("arn:aws:sts::111122223333:assumed-role/aws:ec2-
      infrastructure/i-81e2f56c").
      The key ARN of the KMS key that protects the data volume, arn:aws:kms:us-
      west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab, appears in all 
      three AWS KMS calls (CreateGrant, GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext, and Decrypt).

      Monitor KMS keys with Amazon CloudWatch
      You can monitor your AWS KMS keys using Amazon CloudWatch, an AWS service that collects 
      and processes raw data from AWS KMS into readable, near real-time metrics. These data are 
      recorded for a period of two weeks so that you can access historical information and gain a better 
      understanding of the usage of your KMS keys and their changes over time.
      You can use Amazon CloudWatch to alert you to important events, such as the following ones.
      • The imported key material in a KMS key is nearing its expiration date.
      • A KMS key that is pending deletion is still being used.
      • The key material in a KMS key was automatically rotated.
      • A KMS key was deleted.
      You can also create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that alerts you when your request rate reaches a 
      certain percentage of a quota value. For details, see Manage your AWS KMS API request rates using 
      Service Quotas and Amazon CloudWatch in the AWS Security Blog.
      AWS KMS metrics and dimensions
      AWS KMS predeﬁnes Amazon CloudWatch metrics to make it easier for you to monitor critical data 
      and create alarms. You can view the AWS KMS metrics using the AWS Management Console and 
      the Amazon CloudWatch API.
      This section lists each AWS KMS metrics and the dimensions for each metric, and provides some 
      basic guidance for creating CloudWatch alarms based on these metrics and dimensions.

      SuccessfulRequest
      The number of successful requests for cryptographic operations on a speciﬁc KMS key. By using 
      the SuccessfulRequest metric, you can apply key-level ﬁltering to AWS KMS API usage in 
      CloudWatch. The Sum statistic for this metric deﬁnes the total number of successful requests 
      during the period.
      Use this metric to identify which KMS keys consume the largest portion of your request quota 
      or contribute the most to API charges. You can also create a CloudWatch alarm based on the
      SuccesfulRequest metric to notify you of anomalous AWS KMS API usage patterns. These alerts 
      can help identify ineﬃcient workﬂows that might unintentionally exceed your request quotas or 
      incur unexpected charges.

        Operation     Value for each AWS KMS API operation. This metric applies only to cryptographic 
                      operations.
       For ReEncrypt operations, the SuccessfulRequest metric includes dimensions for both the 
       source and destination KMS keys.
        Dimension     Description
        SourceKey     Value for the KMS key that decrypted the ciphertext.
        Arn
        Destinati     Value for the KMS key that re-encrypted the data.
        onKeyArn
        Operation     Value for each AWS KMS API operation, in this case, ReEncrypt.
       SecondsUntilKeyMaterialExpiration
       The number of seconds remaining until the earliest-expiring imported key material in a KMS 
       key. This metric is valid only for KMS keys with imported key material (a key material origin of
       EXTERNAL) and an expiration date.
       Use this metric to track how much time is left before your earliest-expiring imported 
       key material expires. When that time falls below a threshold that you deﬁne, you should 
       reimport the key material with a new expiration date to keep the KMS key usable. The
       SecondsUntilKeyMaterialExpiration metric is speciﬁc to a KMS key. You cannot use this 
       metric to monitor multiple KMS keys or KMS keys that you might create in the future. For help with 
       creating a CloudWatch alarm to monitor this metric, see Create a CloudWatch alarm for expiration 
       of imported key material.
       The most useful statistic for this metric is Minimum, which tells you the smallest amount of time 
       remaining for all data points in the speciﬁed statistical period. The only valid unit for this metric is
       Seconds.

      When you schedule deletion of a KMS key, AWS KMS enforces a waiting period before deleting 
      the KMS key. You can use the waiting period to ensure that you don't need the KMS key now or 
      in the future. You can also conﬁgure a CloudWatch alarm to warn you if a person or application 
      attempts to use the KMS key in a cryptographic operation during the waiting period. If you receive 
      a notiﬁcation from such an alarm, you might want to cancel deletion of the KMS key.
      For instructions, see Create an alarm that detects use of a KMS key pending deletion.
      CloudHSMKeyStoreThrottle
      The number of requests for cryptographic operations on KMS keys in each AWS CloudHSM key 
      store that AWS KMS throttles (responds with a ThrottlingException). This metric applies only 
      to AWS CloudHSM key stores.
      The CloudHSMKeyStoreThrottle metric applies only to KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key 
      store and only to requests for  cryptographic operations. AWS KMS throttles these requests when 
      the request rate exceeds the custom key store request quota  for your AWS CloudHSM key store. 
      This metric also includes throttling by the AWS CloudHSM cluster.
      Dimension group name: Keystore Throttle Metrics
        Dimension     Description
        CustomKey     Value for each AWS CloudHSM key store.

        ion           operations on KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store.
        KeySpec       Value for each type of KMS key. The only supported key spec for KMS keys in an 
                      AWS CloudHSM key store is SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT.

      ExternalKeyStoreThrottle
      The number of requests for cryptographic operations on KMS keys in each external key store that 
      AWS KMS throttles (responds with a ThrottlingException). This metric applies only to external 
      key stores.
      The ExternalKeyStoreThrottle metric applies only to KMS keys in an external key store and 
      only to requests for cryptographic operations. AWS KMS throttles these requests when the request 
      rate exceeds the custom key store request quota for your external key store. This metric does not 
      include throttling by your external key store proxy or external key manager.
      Use this metric to review and adjust the value of your custom key store request quota. If this 
      metric indicates that AWS KMS is frequently throttling your requests for these KMS keys, you 
      might consider requesting an increase in your custom key store request quota value. For help, see
      Requesting a quota increase in the Service Quotas User Guide.
      If you are getting very frequent KMSInvalidStateException errors with a message that 
      explains that the request was rejected "due to a very high request rate" or the request was rejected 
      "because the external key store proxy did not respond in time," it might indicate that your external 
      key manager or external key store proxy cannot keep pace with the current request rate. If 
      possible, lower your request rate. You might also consider requesting a decrease in your custom 
      key store request quota value. Decreasing this quota value might increase throttling (and the
      ExternalKeyStoreThrottle metric value), but it indicates that AWS KMS is rejecting excess 
      requests quickly before they are sent to your external key store proxy or external key manager. To 
      request a quota decrease, please visit the AWS Support Center and create a case.

      XksProxyCertiﬁcateDaysToExpire
      The number of days until the TLS certiﬁcate for your external key store proxy endpoint
      (XksProxyUriEndpoint) expires. This metric applies only to external key stores.
      Use this metric to create a CloudWatch alarm that notiﬁes you about the upcoming expiration of 
      your TLS certiﬁcate. When the certiﬁcate expires, AWS KMS cannot communicate with the external 
      key store proxy. All data protected by KMS keys in your external key store becomes inaccessible 
      until you renew the certiﬁcate.
      A certiﬁcate alarm prevents certiﬁcate expiration that might prevent you from accessing your 
      encrypted resources. Set the alarm to give your organization time to renew the certiﬁcate before it 
      expires.
      Dimension group name: XKS Proxy Certiﬁcate Metrics
        Dimension     Description

      You can create CloudWatch alarms based on the metrics for external key stores and KMS keys in 
      external key stores. For instructions, see Monitor external key stores.
      XksProxyCredentialAge
      The number of days since the current external key store proxy authentication credential
      (XksProxyAuthenticationCredential) was associated with the external key store. This count 
      begins when you enter the authentication credential as part of creating or updating your external 
      key store. This metric applies only to external key stores.
      This value is designed to remind you about the age of your authentication credential. However, 
      because we begin the count when you associate the credential with your external key store, not 
      when you create your authentication credential on your external key store proxy, this might not be 
      an accurate indicator of the credential age on the proxy.

      external key stores. For instructions, see Monitor external key stores.
      XksProxyErrors
      The number of exceptions related to AWS KMS requests to your external key store proxy. This 
      count includes exceptions that the external key store proxy returns to AWS KMS and timeout 
      errors that occur when the external key store proxy does not respond to AWS KMS within the 250 
      millisecond timeout interval. This metric applies only to external key stores.
      Use this metric to track the error rate of KMS keys in your external key store. It reveals the most 
      frequent errors, so you can prioritize your engineering eﬀort. For example, KMS keys that are 
      generating high rates of non-retryable errors might indicate a problem with the conﬁguration of 
      your external key store. To view your external key store conﬁguration, see View external key stores.

       XksExternalKeyManagerStates
       A count of the number of external key manager instances in each of the following health states:
       Active, Degraded, and Unavailable. The information for this metric comes from the external 
       key store proxy associated with each external key store. This metric applies only to external key 
       stores.
       The following are the health states for the external key manager instances associated with an 
       external key store. Each external key store proxy might use diﬀerent indicators to measure the 
       health states of your external key manager. For details, see the documentation for your external 
       key store proxy.
       •
         Active: The external key manager is healthy.
       •
         Degraded: The external key manager is unhealthy, but can still serve traﬃc
       •
         Unavailable: The external key manager cannot serve traﬃc.

      Use this metric to create a CloudWatch alarm that alerts you to degraded and unavailable external 
      key manager instances. To determine which external key manager instances are in each state, 
      consult your external key store proxy logs.

      You can create CloudWatch alarms based on the metrics for external key stores and KMS keys in 
      external key stores. For instructions, see Monitor external key stores.
      XksProxyLatency
      The number of milliseconds it takes for an external key store proxy to respond to an AWS KMS 
      request. If the request timed out, the recorded value is the 250 millisecond timeout limit. This 
      metric applies only to external key stores.
      Use this metric to evaluate the performance of your external key store proxy and external 
      key manager. For example, if the proxy is frequently timing out on encryption and decryption 
      operations, consult your external proxy administrator.
      Slow responses might also indicate that your external key manager cannot handle the current 
      request traﬃc. AWS KMS recommends that your external key manager be able to handle up to 
      1800 requests for cryptographic operations per second. If your external key manager cannot 
      handle the 1800 requests per second rate, consider requesting a decrease in your request quota for 
      KMS keys in a custom key store. Requests for cryptographic operations using the KMS keys in your 
      external key store will fail fast with a throttling exception, rather than being processed and later 
      rejected by your external key store proxy or external key manager.

      You can create CloudWatch alarms based on the metrics for external key stores and KMS keys in 
      external key stores. For instructions, see Monitor external key stores.
      Create a CloudWatch alarm for expiration of imported key material
      You can create a CloudWatch alarm that notiﬁes you when the imported key material in a KMS key 
      is approaching its expiration time. For example, the alarm can notify you when the time to expire is 
      less than 30 days away.
      When you import key material into a KMS key, you can optionally specify a date and time when 
      the key material expires. When the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and 
      the KMS key becomes unusable. To use the KMS key again, you must reimport the key material. 
      However, if you reimport the key material before it expires, you can avoid disrupting processes that 
      use that KMS key.
      This alarm uses the SecondsUntilKeyMaterialExpires metric that AWS KMS publishes to 
      CloudWatch for KMS keys with imported key material that expires. Each alarm uses this metric to 
      monitor the imported key material for a particular KMS key. You cannot create a single alarm for all 
      KMS keys with expiring key material or an alarm for KMS keys that you might create in the future.
      Requirements
      The following resources are required for a CloudWatch alarm that monitors the expiration of 
      imported key material.

      You can use Amazon EventBridge (formerly Amazon CloudWatch Events) to alert you to the 
      following important events in the lifecycle of your KMS keys.
      • The key material in a KMS key was rotated automatically or on-demand.
      • The imported key material in a KMS key expired.
      • A KMS key that had been scheduled for deletion was deleted.

      AWS KMS integrates with Amazon EventBridge to notify you of important events that aﬀect your 
      KMS keys. Each event is represented in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and includes the event 
      name, the date and time when the event occurred, and the aﬀected. You can collect these events 
      and establish rules that route them to one or more targets such as AWS Lambda functions, Amazon 
      SNS topics, Amazon SQS queues, streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, or built-in targets.
      For more information about using EventBridge with other kinds of events, including those emitted 
      by AWS CloudTrail when it records a read/write API request, see the Amazon EventBridge User 
      Guide.
      The following topics describe the EventBridge events that AWS KMS generates.
      KMS CMK Rotation
      AWS KMS supports automatic and on-demand rotation of the key material in symmetric encryption 
      KMS keys.
      Whenever AWS KMS rotates key material, it sends a KMS CMK Rotation event to EventBridge. 
      AWS KMS generates this event on a best-eﬀort basis.
      The following is an example of this event.

        }
      KMS Imported Key Material Expiration
      When you import key material into a KMS key, you can optionally specify a time at which the key 
      material expires. When the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and sends a 
      corresponding KMS Imported Key Material Expiration event to EventBridge. AWS KMS 
      generates this event on a best-eﬀort basis.
      The following is an example of this event.

          }
        }
      KMS CMK Deletion
      When you schedule deletion of a KMS key, AWS KMS enforces a waiting period before deleting 
      the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key and sends a KMS CMK 
      Deletion event to EventBridge. AWS KMS guarantees this EventBridge event. Due to retries, it 
      might generate multiple events within a few seconds that delete the same KMS key.
      The following is an example of this event.
        { 
          "version": "0",

      Aliases in AWS KMS
      An alias is a friendly name for a AWS KMS key. For example, an alias lets you refer to a KMS key as
      test-key instead of 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
      You can use an alias to identify a KMS key in the AWS KMS console, in the DescribeKey operation, 
      and in cryptographic operations, such as Encrypt and GenerateDataKey. Aliases also make it easy to 
      recognize an AWS managed key. Aliases for these KMS keys always have the form aws/<service-
      name>. For example, the alias for the AWS managed key for Amazon DynamoDB is aws/dynamodb. 
      You can establish similar alias standards for your projects, such as prefacing your aliases with the 
      name of a project or category.
      You can also allow and deny access to KMS keys based on their aliases without editing policies 
      or managing grants. This feature is part of AWS KMS support for attribute-based access control
      (ABAC). For details, see Use aliases to control access to KMS keys.
      Much of the power of aliases come from your ability to change the KMS key associated with an 
      alias at any time. Aliases can make your code easier to write and maintain. For example, suppose 
      you use an alias to refer to a particular KMS key and you want to change the KMS key. In that case, 
      just associate the alias with a diﬀerent KMS key. You don't need to change your code.
      Aliases also make it easier to reuse the same code in diﬀerent AWS Regions. Create aliases with the 
      same name in multiple Regions and associate each alias with a KMS key in its Region. When the 
      code runs in each Region, the alias refers to the associated KMS key in that Region. For an example, 
      see Learn how to use aliases in your applications.
      You can create an alias for a KMS key in the AWS KMS console, by using the CreateAlias API, or by 
      using the AWS::KMS::Alias AWS CloudFormation template.
      The AWS KMS API provides full control of aliases in each account and Region. The API includes 
      operations to create an alias (CreateAlias), view alias names and alias ARNs (ListAliases), change the 
      KMS key associated with an alias (UpdateAlias), and delete an alias (DeleteAlias).

      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      An alias is an independent AWS resource
         An alias is not a property of a KMS key. The actions that you take on the alias don't aﬀect its 
         associated KMS key. You can create an alias for a KMS key and then update the alias so it's 
         associated with a diﬀerent KMS key. You can even delete the alias without any eﬀect on the 
         associated KMS key. However, if you delete a KMS key, all aliases associated with that KMS key 
         are deleted.
         If you specify an alias as the resource in an IAM policy, the policy refers to the alias, not to the 
         associated KMS key.
      Each alias has two formats
         When you create an alias, you specify the alias name. AWS KMS creates the alias ARN for you.
         • An alias ARN is an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identiﬁes the alias.
             # Alias ARN
             arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/<alias-name> 
         • An alias name that is unique in the account and Region. In the AWS KMS API, the alias name is 
           always preﬁxed by alias/. That preﬁx is omitted in the AWS KMS console.
             # Alias name
             alias/<alias-name>
      Aliases are not secret
         Aliases may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output. Do not include 
         conﬁdential or sensitive information in the alias name.
      Each alias is associated with one KMS key at a time
         The alias and its KMS key must be in the same account and Region.
         You can associate an alias with any customer managed key in the same AWS account and 
         Region. However, you do not have permission to associate an alias with an AWS managed key.
         For example, this ListAliases output shows that the test-key alias is associated with exactly 
         one target KMS key, which is represented by the TargetKeyId property.

           }
      Multiple aliases can be associated with the same KMS key
         For example, you can associate the test-key and project-key aliases with the same KMS 
         key.
           { 
                "AliasName": "alias/test-key",

                "LastUpdatedDate": 1593622000.191
           },
           { 
                "AliasName": "alias/project-key", 
                "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/project-key",

                "LastUpdatedDate": 1516435200.399
           }
      An alias must be unique in an account and Region
         For example, you can have only one test-key alias in each account and Region. Aliases are 
         case-sensitive, but aliases that diﬀer only in their capitalization are very prone to error. You 
         cannot change an alias name. However, you can delete the alias and create a new alias with the 
         desired name.
      You can create an alias with the same name in diﬀerent Regions
         For example, you can have a finance-key alias in US East (N. Virginia) and a finance-key
         alias in Europe (Frankfurt). Each alias would be associated with a KMS key in its Region. If your 
         code refers to an alias name like alias/finance-key, you can run it in multiple Regions. 
         In each Region, it uses a diﬀerent KMS key. For details, see Learn how to use aliases in your 
         applications.
      How aliases work                                                                        560
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      You can change the KMS key associated with an alias
         You can use the UpdateAlias operation to associate an alias with a diﬀerent 
         KMS key. For example, if the finance-key alias is associated with the
         1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab KMS key, you can update it so it is associated 
         with the 0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321 KMS key.
         However, the current and new KMS key must be the same type (both symmetric or both 
         asymmetric or both HMAC), and they must have the same key usage (ENCRYPT_DECRYPT or 
         SIGN_VERIFY or GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC). This restriction prevents errors in code that uses 
         aliases. If you must associate an alias with a diﬀerent type of key, and you have mitigated the 
         risks, you can delete and recreate the alias.
      Some KMS keys don't have aliases
         When you create a KMS key in the AWS KMS console, you must give it a new alias. But an alias 
         is not required when you use the CreateKey operation to create a KMS key. Also, you can use 
         the UpdateAlias operation to change the KMS key associated with an alias and the DeleteAlias
         operation to delete an alias. As a result, some KMS keys might have several aliases, and some 
         might have none.
      AWS creates aliases in your account
         AWS creates aliases in your account for AWS managed keys. These aliases have names of the 
         form alias/aws/<service-name>, such as alias/aws/s3.
         Some AWS aliases have no KMS key. These predeﬁned aliases are usually associated with an 
         AWS managed key when you start using the service.
      Use aliases to identify KMS keys
         You can use an alias name or alias ARN to identify a KMS key in cryptographic operations,
         DescribeKey, and GetPublicKey. (If the KMS key is in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use 
         its key ARN or alias ARN.) Aliases are not valid identiﬁers for KMS keys in other AWS KMS 
         operations. For information about the valid key identiﬁers for each AWS KMS API operation, see 
         the descriptions of the KeyId parameters in the AWS Key Management Service API Reference.
         You cannot use an alias name or alias ARN to identify a KMS key in an IAM policy. To control 
         access to a KMS key based on its aliases, use the kms:RequestAlias or kms:ResourceAliases
         condition keys. For details, see ABAC for AWS KMS.
      How aliases work                                                                        561
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Controlling access to aliases
      When you create or change an alias, you aﬀect the alias and its associated KMS key. Therefore, 
      principals who manage aliases must have permission to call the alias operation on the alias and on 
      all aﬀected KMS keys. You can provide these permissions by using key policies, IAM policies and
      grants.
           Note
           Be cautious when giving principals permission to manage tags and aliases. Changing a tag 
           or alias can allow or deny permission to the customer managed key. For details, see ABAC 
           for AWS KMS and Use aliases to control access to KMS keys.
      For information about controlling access to all AWS KMS operations, see Permissions reference.
      Permissions to create and manage aliases work as follows.
      kms:CreateAlias
      To create an alias, the principal needs the following permissions for both the alias and for the 
      associated KMS key.
      •
        kms:CreateAlias for the alias. Provide this permission in an IAM policy that is attached to the 
        principal who is allowed to create the alias.
        The following example policy statement speciﬁes a particular alias in a Resource element. But 
        you can list multiple alias ARNs or specify an alias pattern, such as "test*". You can also specify 
        a Resource value of "*" to allow the principal to create any alias in the account and Region. 
        Permission to create an alias can also be included in a kms:Create* permission for all resources 
        in an account and Region.

            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/test-key"
          }
      •
        kms:CreateAlias for the KMS key. This permission must be provided in a key policy or in an 
        IAM policy that is delegated from the key policy.
          { 
            "Sid": "Key policy for 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",

              "kms:CreateAlias", 
              "kms:DescribeKey" 
            ], 
            "Resource": "*"
          }
      You can use condition keys to limit the KMS keys that you can associate with an alias. For 
      example, you can use the kms:KeySpec condition key to allow the principal to create aliases 
      only on asymmetric KMS keys. For a full list of conditions keys that you can use to limit the
      kms:CreateAlias permission on KMS key resources, see AWS KMS permissions.
      kms:ListAliases
      To list aliases in the account and Region, the principal must have kms:ListAliases permission in 
      an IAM policy. Because this policy isn't related to any particular KMS key or alias resource, the value 
      of the resource element in the policy must be "*".
      For example, the following IAM policy statement gives the principal permission to list all KMS keys 
      and aliases in the account and Region.
        { 
          "Version": "2012-10-17", 
          "Statement": {

            "Resource": "*" 
      kms:ListAliases                                                                         563

          }
        }
      kms:UpdateAlias
      To change the KMS key that is associated with an alias, the principal needs three permission 
      elements: one for the alias, one for the current KMS key, and one for the new KMS key.
      For example, suppose you want to change the test-key alias from the KMS key with key ID 
      1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab to the KMS key with key ID 0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-
      ab0987654321. In that case, include policy statements similar to the examples in this section.
      •
        kms:UpdateAlias for the alias. You provide this permission in an IAM policy that is attached to 
        the principal. The following IAM policy speciﬁes a particular alias. But you can list multiple alias 
        ARNs or specify an alias pattern, such as "test*". You can also specify a Resource value of
        "*" to allow the principal to update any alias in the account and Region.

      •
        kms:UpdateAlias for the KMS key that the operation associates with the alias. This permission 
        must be provided in a key policy or in an IAM policy that is delegated from the key policy.

            ], 
            "Resource": "*"
          }
      You can use condition keys to limit either or both of KMS keys in an UpdateAlias operation. For 
      example, you can use a kms:ResourceAliases condition key to allow the principal to update aliases 
      only when the target KMS key already has a particular alias. For a full list of conditions keys that 
      you can use to limit the kms:UpdateAlias permission on a KMS key resource, see AWS KMS 
      permissions.
      kms:DeleteAlias
      To delete an alias, the principal needs permission for the alias and for the associated KMS key.
      As always, you should exercise caution when giving principals permission to delete a resource. 
      However, deleting an alias has no eﬀect on the associated KMS key. Although it might cause a 
      failure in an application that relies on the alias, if you mistakenly delete an alias, you can recreate 
      it.
      •
        kms:DeleteAlias for the alias. Provide this permission in an IAM policy attached to the 
        principal who is allowed to delete the alias.

            "Resource": "*"
          }
      Limiting alias permissions
      You can use condition keys to limit alias permissions when the resource is a KMS key. For example, 
      the following IAM policy allows the alias operations on KMS keys in a particular account and 
      Region. However, it uses the kms:KeyOrigin condition key to further limit the permissions to KMS 
      keys with key material from AWS KMS.
      For a full list of conditions keys that you can use to limit alias permission on a KMS key resource, 
      see AWS KMS permissions.

          "Sid": "IAMPolicyKeyPermissions", 
          "Effect": "Allow",

            } 
          }   
        }
      You can't use condition keys in a policy statement where the resource is an alias. To limit the aliases 
      that a principal can manage, use the value of the Resource element of the IAM policy statement 
      that controls access to the alias. For example, the following policy statements allow the principal 
      to create, update, or delete any alias in the AWS account and Region unless the alias begins with
      Restricted.
        { 
          "Sid": "IAMPolicyForAnAliasAllow",

      Create aliases
      You can create aliases in the AWS KMS console or by using AWS KMS API operations.
      Create aliases                                                                          567

      The alias must be string of 1–256 characters. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward 
      slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name for a customer managed key cannot 
      begin with alias/aws/. The alias/aws/ preﬁx is reserved for AWS managed key.
      You can create an alias for a new KMS key or for an existing KMS key. You might add an alias so 
      that a particular KMS key is used in a project or application.
      You can also use a AWS CloudFormation template to create an alias for a KMS key. For more 
      information, see AWS::KMS::Alias in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      When you create a KMS key in the AWS KMS console, you must create an alias for the new KMS key. 
      To create an alias for an existing KMS key, use the Aliases tab on the detail page for the KMS key.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys. You cannot manage aliases for AWS 
          managed keys or AWS owned keys.
      4.  In the table, choose the key ID or alias of the KMS key. Then, on the KMS key detail page, 
          choose the Aliases tab.
          If a KMS key has multiple aliases, the Aliases column in the table displays one alias and an 
          alias summary, such as (+n more). Choosing the alias summary takes you directly to the
          Aliases tab on the KMS key detail page.
      5.  On the Aliases tab, choose Create alias. Enter an alias name and choose Create alias.

               Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
               displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
               Note
               Do not add the alias/ preﬁx. The console automatically adds it for you. If you enter
               alias/ExampleAlias, the actual alias name will be alias/alias/ExampleAlias.

      Using the AWS KMS API
      To create an alias, use the CreateAlias operation. Unlike the process of creating KMS keys in the 
      console, the CreateKey operation doesn't create an alias for a new KMS key.
           Important
           Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be displayed 
           in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      You can use the CreateAlias operation to create an alias for a new KMS key with no alias. You 
      can also use the CreateAlias operation to add an alias to any existing KMS key or to recreate an 
      alias that was accidentally deleted.
      In the AWS KMS API operations, the alias name must begin with alias/ followed by a name, such 
      as alias/ExampleAlias. The alias must be unique in the account and Region. To ﬁnd the alias 
      names that are already in use, use the ListAliases operation. The alias name is case sensitive.
      The TargetKeyId can be any customer managed key in the same AWS Region. To identify the 
      KMS key, use its key ID or key ARN. You cannot use another alias.
      The following example creates the example-key alias and associates it with the speciﬁed KMS 
      key. These examples use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For examples in multiple 
      programming languages, see Use CreateAlias with an AWS SDK or CLI.
        $ aws kms create-alias \ 
            --alias-name alias/example-key \ 
            --target-key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
      CreateAlias does not return any output. To see the new alias, use the ListAliases operation. 
      For details, see Using the AWS KMS API.
      Find the alias name and alias ARN for a KMS key
      Aliases make it easy to recognize KMS keys in the AWS KMS console. You can view the aliases for a 
      KMS key in the AWS KMS console or by using the ListAliases operation. The DescribeKey operation, 
      which returns the properties of a KMS key, does not include aliases.
      Find the alias name and alias ARN                                                       569

      The following procedures demonstrate how to view and identify the aliases associated with a 
      KMS key using the AWS KMS console and AWS KMS API. The AWS KMS API examples use the AWS 
      Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any supported programming language.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      The AWS KMS console displays the aliases associated with the KMS key.
      1.  Open the AWS KMS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  To view the keys in your account that you create and manage, in the navigation pane choose
          Customer managed keys. To view the keys in your account that AWS creates and manages for 
          you, in the navigation pane, choose AWS managed keys.
      4.  The Aliases column displays the alias for each KMS key. If a KMS key does not have an alias, a 
          dash (-) appears in the Aliases column.
          If a KMS key has multiple aliases, the Aliases column also has an alias summary, such as (+n
          more). For example, the following KMS key has two aliases, one of which is key-test.
          To ﬁnd the alias name and alias ARN of all aliases for the KMS key, use the Aliases tab.
          • To go directly to the Aliases tab, in the Aliases column, choose the alias summary (+n more). 
            An alias summary appears only if the KMS key has more than one alias.
          • Or, choose the alias or key ID of the KMS key (which opens the detail page for the KMS key) 
            and then choose the Aliases tab. The tabs are under the General conﬁguration section.
      5.  The Aliases tab displays the alias name and alias ARN of all aliases for a KMS key. You can also 
          create and delete aliases for the KMS key on this tab.
      Find the alias name and alias ARN                                                       570

      AWS managed keys
      You can use the alias to recognize an AWS managed key, as shown in this example AWS managed 
      keys page. The aliases for AWS managed keys always have the format: aws/<service-name>. For 
      example, the alias for the AWS managed key for Amazon DynamoDB is aws/dynamodb.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      The ListAliases operation returns the alias name and alias ARN of aliases in the account and Region. 
      The output includes aliases for AWS managed keys and for customer managed keys. The aliases for 
      AWS managed keys have the format aws/<service-name>, such as aws/dynamodb.
      Find the alias name and alias ARN                                                       571

      The response might also include aliases that have no TargetKeyId ﬁeld. These are predeﬁned 
      aliases that AWS has created but has not yet associated with a KMS key.

      To get all aliases that are associated with a particular KMS key, use the optional KeyId parameter 
      of the ListAliases operation. The KeyId parameter takes the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.
      This example gets all aliases associated with the 0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321
      KMS key.
        $ aws kms list-aliases --key-id 0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321
        { 
            "Aliases": [ 
                { 
                    "AliasName": "alias/access-key",

                    "LastUpdatedDate": "2018-01-20T15:23:10.194000-07:00" 
                }, 
                { 
                    "AliasName": "alias/finance-project", 
                    "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/finance-project", 
                    "TargetKeyId": "0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321",

                } 
            ]
        }
      The KeyId parameter doesn't take wildcard characters, but you can use the features of your 
      programming language to ﬁlter the response.
      For example, the following AWS CLI command gets only the aliases for AWS managed keys.
        $ aws kms list-aliases --query 'Aliases[?starts_with(AliasName, `alias/aws/`)]'
      The following command gets only the access-key alias. The alias name is case-sensitive.

            }
        ]
      Update aliases
      Because an alias is an independent resource, you can change the KMS key associated with an alias. 
      For example, if the test-key alias is associated with one KMS key, you can use the UpdateAlias
      operation to associate it with a diﬀerent KMS key. This is one of several ways to manually rotate a 
      KMS key without changing its key material. You might also update a KMS key so that an application 
      that was using one KMS key for new resources is now using a diﬀerent KMS key.
      You cannot update an alias in the AWS KMS console. Also, you cannot use UpdateAlias (or any 
      other operation) to change an alias name. To change an alias name, delete the current alias and 
      then create a new alias for the KMS key.
      When you update an alias, the current KMS key and the new KMS key must be the same type (both 
      symmetric or asymmetric or HMAC). They must also have the same key usage (ENCRYPT_DECRYPT
      or SIGN_VERIFY or GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC). This restriction prevents cryptographic errors in 
      code that uses aliases.
      The following example begins by using the ListAliases operation to show that the test-key alias 
      is currently associated with KMS key 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
        $ aws kms list-aliases --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
        {

      Next, it uses the UpdateAlias operation to change the KMS key that is associated with the test-
      key alias to KMS key 0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321. You don't need to specify 
      the currently associated KMS key, only the new ("target") KMS key. The alias name is case sensitive.
        $ aws kms update-alias --alias-name 'alias/test-key' --target-key-id 
         0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321
      To verify that the alias is now associated with the target KMS key, use the ListAliases operation 
      again. This AWS CLI command uses the --query parameter to get only the test-key alias. The
      TargetKeyId and LastUpdatedDate ﬁelds are updated.
        $ aws kms list-aliases --query 'Aliases[?AliasName==`alias/test-key`]'

            }
        ]
      Delete an alias
      You can delete an alias in the AWS KMS console or by using the DeleteAlias operation. Before 
      deleting an alias, make sure that it's not in use. Although deleting an alias doesn't aﬀect the 
      associated KMS key, it might create problems for any application that uses the alias. If you delete 
      an alias by mistake, you can create a new alias with the same name and associate it with the same 
      or a diﬀerent KMS key.
      If you delete a KMS key, all aliases associated with that KMS key are deleted.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      To delete an alias in the AWS KMS console, use the Aliases tab on the detail page for the KMS key. 
      You can delete multiple aliases for a KMS key at one time.
      Delete an alias                                                                         575

      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys. You cannot manage aliases for AWS 
          managed keys or AWS owned keys.
      4.  In the table, choose the key ID or alias of the KMS key. Then, on the KMS key detail page, 
          choose the Aliases tab.
          If a KMS key has multiple aliases, the Aliases column in the table displays one alias and an 
          alias summary, such as (+n more). Choosing the alias summary takes you directly to the
          Aliases tab on the KMS key detail page.
      5.  On the Aliases tab, select the check box next to the aliases that you want to delete. Then 
          choose Delete.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To delete an alias, use the DeleteAlias operation. This operation deletes one alias at a time. The 
      alias name is case-sensitive and it must be preceded by the alias/ preﬁx.
      For example, the following command deletes the test-key alias. This command does not return 
      any output.
        $ aws kms delete-alias --alias-name alias/test-key
      To verify that the alias is deleted, use the ListAliases operation. The following command uses the
      --query parameter in the AWS CLI to get only the test-key alias. The empty brackets in the 
      response indicate that the ListAliases response didn't include a test-key alias. To eliminate 
      the brackets, use the --output text parameter and value.
        $ aws kms list-aliases --query 'Aliases[?AliasName==`alias/test-key`]'
        []
      Use aliases to control access to KMS keys
      You can control access to KMS keys based on the aliases that are associated with the KMS key. To 
      do so, use the kms:RequestAlias and kms:ResourceAliases condition keys. This feature is part of 
      AWS KMS support for attribute-based access control (ABAC).
      Use aliases to control access to KMS keys                                               576
      AWS Key Management Service                                                   Developer Guide
      The kms:RequestAlias condition key allows or denies access to a KMS key based on the alias in a 
      request. The kms:ResourceAliases condition key allows or denies access to a KMS key based on 
      the aliases associated with the KMS key.
      These features do not allow you to identify a KMS key by using an alias in the resource element 
      of a policy statement. When an alias is the value of a resource element, the policy applies to the 
      alias resource, not to any KMS key that might be associated with it.
           Note
           It might take up to ﬁve minutes for tag and alias changes to aﬀect KMS key authorization. 
           Recent changes might be visible in API operations before they aﬀect authorization.
      When using aliases to control access to KMS keys, consider the following:
      • Use aliases to reinforce the best practice of least privileged access. Give IAM principals only the 
        permissions that they need for only the KMS keys that they must use or manage. For example, 
        use aliases to identify the KMS keys used for a project. Then give the project team permission to 
        use only KMS keys with the project aliases.
      •
        Be cautious about giving principals the kms:CreateAlias, kms:UpdateAlias, or
        kms:DeleteAlias permissions that let them add, edit, and delete aliases. When you use aliases 
        to control access to KMS keys, changing an alias can give principals permission to use KMS keys 
        that they didn't otherwise have permission to use. It can also deny access to KMS keys that other 
        principals require to do their jobs.
      • Review the principals in your AWS account that currently have permission to manage aliases and 
        adjust the permissions, if necessary. Key administrators who don't have permission to change 
        key policies or create grants can control access to KMS keys if they have permission to manage 
        aliases.
        For example, the console default key policy for key administrators includes
        kms:CreateAlias, kms:DeleteAlias, and kms:UpdateAlias permission. IAM policies 
        might give alias permissions for all KMS keys in your AWS account. For example, the
        AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser managed policy allows principals to create, delete, and 
        list aliases for all KMS keys but not update them.
      • Before setting a policy that depends on an alias, review the aliases on the KMS keys in your AWS 
        account. Make sure that your policy applies only to the aliases that you intend to include. Use
      Use aliases to control access to KMS keys                                           577

        CloudTrail logs and CloudWatch alarms to alert you to alias changes that might aﬀect access to 
        your KMS keys. Also, the ListAliases response includes the creation date and last updated date 
        for each alias.
      • The alias policy conditions use pattern matching; they aren't tied to a particular instance of an 
        alias. A policy that uses alias-based condition keys aﬀects all new and existing aliases that match 
        the pattern. If you delete and recreate an alias that matches a policy condition, the condition 
        applies to the new alias, just as it did to the old one.
      The kms:RequestAlias condition key relies on the alias speciﬁed explicitly in an operation 
      request. The kms:ResourceAliases condition key depends on the aliases that are associated 
      with a KMS key, even if they don't appear in the request.
      kms:RequestAlias
      Allow or deny access to a KMS key based on the alias that identiﬁes the KMS key in a request. You 
      can use the kms:RequestAlias condition key in a key policy or IAM policy. It applies to operations 
      that use an alias to identify a KMS key in a request, namely cryptographic operations, DescribeKey, 
      and GetPublicKey. It is not valid for alias operations, such as CreateAlias or DeleteAlias.
      In the condition key, specify an alias name or alias name pattern. You cannot specify an alias ARN.
      For example, the following key policy statement allows principals to use the speciﬁed operations 
      on the KMS key. The permission is eﬀective only when the request uses an alias that includes
      alpha to identify the KMS key.
        { 
          "Sid": "Key policy using a request alias condition", 
          "Effect": "Allow", 
          "Principal": { 
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/alpha-developer" 
          }, 
          "Action": [ 
            "kms:Decrypt", 
            "kms:GenerateDataKey*",

          ], 
          "Resource": "*", 
          "Condition": { 
            "StringLike": { 
              "kms:RequestAlias": "alias/*alpha*" 
      kms:RequestAlias                                                                        578
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
            } 
          }
        }
      The following example request from an authorized principal would fulﬁll the condition. However, 
      a request that used a key ID, a key ARN, or a diﬀerent alias would not fulﬁll the condition, even if 
      these values identiﬁed the same KMS key.
        $ aws kms describe-key --key-id "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/project-
        alpha"
      kms:ResourceAliases
      Allow or deny access to a KMS key based on the aliases associated with the KMS key, even if the 
      alias isn't used in a request. The kms:ResourceAliases condition key lets you specify an alias or alias 
      pattern, such as alias/test*, so you can use it in an IAM policy to control access to several KMS 
      keys in the same Region. It's valid for any AWS KMS operation that uses a KMS key.
      For example, the following IAM policy lets the principals call the speciﬁed operations on the KMS 
      keys in two AWS accounts. However, the permission applies only to KMS keys associated with 
      aliases that begin with restricted.
        { 
          "Version": "2012-10-17", 
          "Statement": [ 
            { 
              "Sid": "AliasBasedIAMPolicy", 
              "Effect": "Allow", 
              "Action": [ 
                "kms:Decrypt", 
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*", 
                "kms:DescribeKey" 
              ], 
              "Resource": [ 
                "arn:aws:kms:*:111122223333:key/*", 
                "arn:aws:kms:*:444455556666:key/*" 
              ], 
              "Condition": { 
                "ForAnyValue:StringLike": { 
                  "kms:ResourceAliases": "alias/restricted*" 
                } 
      kms:ResourceAliases                                                                     579

              } 
            } 
          ]
        }
      The kms:ResourceAliases condition is a condition of the resource, not the request. As such, a 
      request that doesn't specify the alias can still satisfy the condition.
      The following example request, which speciﬁes a matching alias, satisﬁes the condition.
        $ aws kms enable-key-rotation --key-id "alias/restricted-project"
      However, the following example request also satisﬁes the condition, provided that the speciﬁed 
      KMS key has an alias that begins with restricted, even if that alias isn't used in the request.
        $ aws kms enable-key-rotation --key-id "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
      Learn how to use aliases in your applications
      You can use an alias to represent a KMS key in your application code. The KeyId parameter in AWS 
      KMS cryptographic operations, DescribeKey, and GetPublicKey accepts an alias name or alias ARN.
      For example, the following GenerateDataKey command uses an alias name (alias/finance) to 
      identify a KMS key. The alias name is the value of the KeyId parameter.
        $ aws kms generate-data-key --key-id alias/finance --key-spec AES_256
      If the KMS key is in a diﬀerent AWS account, you must use a key ARN or alias ARN in these 
      operations. When using an alias ARN, remember that the alias for a KMS key is deﬁned in the 
      account that owns the KMS key and might diﬀer in each Region. For help ﬁnding the alias ARN, see
      Find the alias name and alias ARN for a KMS key.
      For example, the following GenerateDataKey command uses a KMS key that's not in the caller's 
      account. The ExampleAlias alias is associated with the KMS key in the speciﬁed account and 
      Region.
        $ aws kms generate-data-key --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/
        ExampleAlias --key-spec AES_256

      One of the most powerful uses of aliases is in applications that run in multiple AWS Regions. For 
      example, you might have a global application that uses an RSA asymmetric KMS key for signing 
      and veriﬁcation.

      You could create a diﬀerent version of your application in each Region or use a dictionary or switch 
      statement to select the right KMS key for each Region. But it's much easier to create an alias with 
      the same alias name in each Region. Remember that the alias name is case-sensitive.
        aws --region us-west-2 kms create-alias \ 
            --alias-name alias/new-app \ 
            --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-
        west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

        southeast-1:111122223333:key/1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f1a2b3c4d
      Then, use the alias in your code. When your code runs in each Region, the alias will refer to its 
      associated KMS key in that Region. For example, this code calls the Sign operation with an alias 
      name.
        aws kms sign --key-id alias/new-app \ 
            --message $message \ 
            --message-type RAW \

      However, there is a risk that the alias might be deleted or updated to be associated with a diﬀerent 
      KMS key. In that case, the application's attempts to verify signatures using the alias name will fail, 
      and you might need to recreate or update the alias.
      To mitigate this risk, be cautious about giving principals permission to manage the aliases that you 
      use in your application. For details, see Controlling access to aliases.
      There are several other solutions for applications that encrypt data in multiple AWS Regions, 
      including the AWS Encryption SDK.
      Find aliases in AWS CloudTrail logs
      You can use an alias to represent an AWS KMS key in an AWS KMS API operation. When you do, the 
      alias and the key ARN of the KMS key are recorded in the AWS CloudTrail log entry for the event. 
      The alias appears in the requestParameters ﬁeld. The key ARN appears in the resources ﬁeld. 
      This is true even when an AWS service uses an AWS managed key in your account.
      For example, the following GenerateDataKey request uses the project-key alias to represent a 
      KMS key.
        $ aws kms generate-data-key --key-id alias/project-key --key-spec AES_256
      When this request is recorded in the CloudTrail log, the log entry includes both the alias and the 
      key ARN of the actual KMS key that was used.

      Tags in AWS KMS
      A tag is an optional metadata label that you can assign (or AWS can assign) to an AWS resource. 
      Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value, both of which are case-sensitive strings. The tag 
      value can be an empty (null) string. Each tag on a resource must have a diﬀerent tag key, but you 
      can add the same tag to multiple AWS resources. Each resource can have up to 50 user-created 
      tags.
      Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in the tag key or tag value. Tags are accessible 
      to many AWS services, including billing.
      In AWS KMS, you can add tags to a customer managed key when you create the KMS key, and tag 
      or untag existing KMS keys unless they are pending deletion. You cannot tag aliases, custom key 
      stores, AWS managed keys,AWS owned keys, or KMS keys in other AWS accounts. Tags are optional, 
      but they can be very useful.
      For example, you can add a "Project"="Alpha" tag to all KMS keys and Amazon S3 buckets that 
      you use for the Alpha project.
        TagKey   = "Project"
        TagValue = "Alpha"
      For general information about tags, including the format and syntax, see Tagging AWS resources in 
      the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
      Tags help you do the following:
      • Identify and organize your AWS resources. Many AWS services support tagging, so you can assign 
        the same tag to resources from diﬀerent services to indicate that the resources are related. For 
        example, you can assign the same tag to a KMS key and an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon 
        EBS) volume or AWS Secrets Manager secret. You can also use tags to identify KMS keys for 
        automation.
      • Track your AWS costs. When you add tags to your AWS resources, AWS generates a cost 
        allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags. You can use this feature to track AWS 
        KMS costs for a project, application, or cost center.
        For more information about using tags for cost allocation, see Using Cost Allocation Tags in the
        AWS Billing User Guide. For information about the rules for tag keys and tag values, see User-
        Deﬁned Tag Restrictions in the AWS Billing User Guide.

      • Control access to your AWS resources. Allowing and denying access to KMS keys based on their 
        tags is part of AWS KMS support for attribute-based access control (ABAC). For information 
        about controlling access to AWS KMS keys based on their tags, see Use tags to control access to 
        KMS keys. For more general information about using tags to control access to AWS resources, see
        Controlling Access to AWS Resources Using Resource Tags in the IAM User Guide.
      AWS KMS writes an entry to your AWS CloudTrail log when you use the TagResource,
      UntagResource, or ListResourceTags operations.

      • Use tags to control access to KMS keys
      Controlling access to tags
      To add, view, and delete tags, either in the AWS KMS console or by using the API, principals need 
      tagging permissions. You can provide these permissions in key policies. You can also provide 
      them in IAM policies (including VPC endpoint policies), but only if the key policy allows it. The
      AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser managed policy allows principals to tag, untag, and list 
      tags on all KMS keys the account can access.
      You can also limit these permissions by using AWS global condition keys for tags. In AWS KMS, 
      these conditions can control access to tagging operations, such as TagResource and UntagResource.
          Note
          Be cautious when giving principals permission to manage tags and aliases. Changing a tag 
          or alias can allow or deny permission to the customer managed key. For details, see ABAC 
          for AWS KMS and Use tags to control access to KMS keys.

      For example policies and more information, see Controlling Access Based on Tag Keys in the IAM 
      User Guide.
      Permissions to create and manage tags work as follows.
      kms:TagResource
         Allows principals to add or edit tags. To add tags while creating a KMS key, the principal must 
         have permission in an IAM policy that isn't restricted to particular KMS keys.
      kms:ListResourceTags
         Allows principals to view tags on KMS keys.
      kms:UntagResource
         Allows principals to delete tags from KMS keys.
      Tag permissions in policies
      You can provide tagging permissions in a key policy or IAM policy. For example, the following 
      example key policy gives select users tagging permission on the KMS key. It gives all users who can 
      assume the example Administrator or Developer roles permission to view tags.
        {

              "Resource": "*" 
            } 
          ]
        }
      To give principals tagging permission on multiple KMS keys, you can use an IAM policy. For this 
      policy to be eﬀective, the key policy for each KMS key must allow the account to use IAM policies 
      to control access to the KMS key.
      For example, the following IAM policy allows the principals to create KMS keys. It also allows them 
      to create and manage tags on all KMS keys in the speciﬁed account. This combination allows the 
      principals to use the Tags parameter of the CreateKey operation to add tags to a KMS key while 
      they are creating it.

            }     
          ]
        }
      Limiting tag permissions
      You can limit tagging permissions by using policy conditions. The following policy conditions can 
      be applied to the kms:TagResource and kms:UntagResource permissions. For example, you 
      can use the aws:RequestTag/tag-key condition to allow a principal to add only particular 
      tags, or prevent a principal from adding tags with particular tag keys. Or, you can use the
      kms:KeyOrigin condition to prevent principals from tagging or untagging KMS keys with
      imported key material.
      • aws:RequestTag
      • aws:ResourceTag/tag-key (IAM policies only)
      • aws:TagKeys
      • kms:CallerAccount
      • kms:KeySpec
      • kms:KeyUsage
      • kms:KeyOrigin
      • kms:ViaService
      As a best practice when you use tags to control access to KMS keys, use the
      aws:RequestTag/tag-key or aws:TagKeys condition key to determine which tags (or tag keys) 
      are allowed.
      For example, the following IAM policy is similar to the previous one. However, this policy allows 
      the principals to create tags (TagResource) and delete tags UntagResource only for tags with a
      Project tag key.
      Because TagResource and UntagResource requests can include multiple tags, you must 
      specify a ForAllValues or ForAnyValue set operator with the aws:TagKeys condition. The
      Limiting tag permissions                                                                588

      ForAnyValue operator requires that at least one of the tag keys in the request matches one of the 
      tag keys in the policy. The ForAllValues operator requires that all of the tag keys in the request 
      match one of the tag keys in the policy. The ForAllValues operator also returns true if there 
      are no tags in the request, but TagResource and UntagResource fail when no tags are speciﬁed. For 
      details about the set operators, see Use multiple keys and values in the IAM User Guide.

      Add tags to a KMS key
      Tags help identify and organize your AWS resources. You can add tags to a customer managed key 
      when you create the KMS key, or add tags to existing KMS keys. You cannot tag AWS managed 
      keys.

      Add tags while creating a KMS key
      You can add tags to a KMS key as you create the key using the AWS KMS console or the CreateKey
      operation. To add tags when creating a KMS key, you must have kms:TagResource permission 
      in an IAM policy in addition to the permissions required to create KMS keys. At a minimum, the 
      permission must cover all KMS keys in the account and Region. For details, see Controlling access to 
      tags.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      To add tags when creating a KMS key in the console, you must have the permissions required to 
      view KMS keys in the console in addition to the permissions required to tag and create KMS keys. 
      At a minimum, the permission must cover all KMS keys in the account and Region.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys. (You cannot manage the tags of an 
          AWS managed key)
      4.  Choose the key type, then choose Next.
      5.  Enter an alias and optional description.
      6.  Enter a tag key and, optionally, a tag value. To add additional tags, choose Add tag. To delete 
          a tag, choose Remove. When you're done tagging your new KMS key, choose Next.
      7.  Finish creating your KMS key.

      Using the AWS KMS API
      To specify tags when creating keys using the CreateKey operation, use the Tags parameter of the 
      operation.
      The value of the Tags parameter of CreateKey is a collection of case-sensitive tag key and tag 
      value pairs. Each tag on a KMS key must have a diﬀerent tag name. The tag value can be a null or 
      empty string.
      For example, the following AWS CLI command creates a symmetric encryption KMS key with a
      Project:Alpha tag. When specifying more than one key-value pair, use a space to separate each 
      pair.
        $ aws kms create-key --tags TagKey=Project,TagValue=Alpha
      When this command is successful, it returns a KeyMetadata object with information about 
      the new KMS key. However, the KeyMetadata does not include tags. To get the tags, use the
      ListResourceTags operation.
      Add tags to existing KMS keys
      You can add tags to your existing customer managed KMS keys in the AWS KMS console or by using 
      the TagResource operation. To add tags, you need tagging permission on the KMS key. You can 
      get this permission from the key policy for the KMS key or, if the key policy allows it, from an IAM 
      policy that includes the KMS key.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys. (You cannot manage the tags of an 
          AWS managed key)
      4.  You can use the table ﬁlter to display only KMS keys with particular tags. For details, see View 
          tags using the AWS KMS console.
      5.  Select the check box next to the alias of a KMS key.
      6.  Choose Key actions, Add or edit tags.

      7.  On the details page for KMS key, choose the Tags tab.
          • To create your ﬁrst tag, choose Create tag, type a tag key (required) and tag value (optional), 
            and then choose Save.
            If you leave the tag value blank, the actual tag value is a null or empty string.
          • To add a tag, choose Edit, choose Add tag, type a tag key and tag value, and then choose
            Save.
      8.  To save your changes, choose Save changes.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      The TagResource operation adds one or more tags to a KMS key. You cannot use this operation to 
      add tags in a diﬀerent AWS account. You can also use the TagResource operation to edit existing 
      tags. For more information, see the section called “Edit tags”.
      To add a tag, specify a new tag key and a tag value. Each tag on a KMS key must have a diﬀerent 
      tag key. The tag value can be a null or empty string.
      For example, the following command adds Purpose and Department tags to an example KMS 
      key.
        $ aws kms tag-resource \ 
                 --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
                 --tags TagKey=Purpose,TagValue=Pretest TagKey=Department,TagValue=Finance
      When this command is successful, it does not return any output. To view the tags on a KMS key, use 
      the ListResourceTags operation.
      Edit tags associated with a KMS key
      Tags help identify and organize your AWS resources. You can edit the tags associated with your 
      customer managed KMS keys in the AWS KMS console or by using the TagResource operation. You 
      cannot edit the tags of an AWS managed key.
      The following procedures demonstrate how to edit the tags associated with a KMS key. The AWS 
      KMS API examples use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any supported 
      programming language.

      Using the AWS KMS API
      The TagResource operation add one or more tags to a customer managed key;. However, you can 
      also use TagResource to change the tag value of an existing tag. You cannot use this operation to 
      add or edit tags in a diﬀerent AWS account.
      To edit a tag, specify an existing tag key and a new tag value. Each tag on a KMS key must have a 
      diﬀerent tag key. The tag value can be a null or empty string.
      For example, this command changes the value of the Purpose tag from Pretest to Test.
        $ aws kms tag-resource \ 
                 --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \

      Using the AWS KMS API
      The UntagResource operation deletes tags from a KMS key. To identify the tags to delete, specify 
      the tag keys. You cannot use this operation to delete tags from KMS keys a diﬀerent AWS account.
      When it succeeds, the UntagResource operation doesn't return any output. Also, if the speciﬁed 
      tag key isn't found on the KMS key, it doesn't throw an exception or return a response. To conﬁrm 
      that the operation worked, use the ListResourceTags operation.
      For example, this command deletes the Purpose tag and its value from the speciﬁed KMS key.

      4.  You can use the table ﬁlter to display only KMS keys with particular tags.
          To display only KMS keys with a particular tag, choose the ﬁlter box, choose the tag key, and 
          then choose from among the actual tag values. You can also type all or part of the tag value.
          The resulting table displays all KMS keys with the chosen tag. However, it doesn't display the 
          tag. To see the tag, choose the key ID or alias of the KMS key and on its detail page, choose the
          Tags tab. The tabs appear below the General conﬁguration section.
          This ﬁlter requires both the tag key and tag value. It won't ﬁnd KMS keys by typing only 
          the tag key or only its value. To ﬁlter tags by all or part of the tag key or value, use the

      Use tags to control access to KMS keys
      You can control access to AWS KMS keys based on the tags on the KMS key. For example, you 
      can write an IAM policy that allows principals to enable and disable only the KMS keys that 
      have a particular tag. Or you can use an IAM policy to prevent principals from using KMS keys in 
      cryptographic operations unless the KMS key has a particular tag.
      This feature is part of AWS KMS support for attribute-based access control (ABAC). For information 
      about using tags to control access to AWS resources, see What is ABAC for AWS? and Controlling 
      Access to AWS Resources Using Resource Tags in the IAM User Guide. For help resolving access 
      issues related to ABAC, see Troubleshooting ABAC for AWS KMS.
           Note
           It might take up to ﬁve minutes for tag and alias changes to aﬀect KMS key authorization. 
           Recent changes might be visible in API operations before they aﬀect authorization.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      AWS KMS supports the aws:ResourceTag/tag-key global condition context key, which lets you 
      control access to KMS keys based on the tags on the KMS key. Because multiple KMS keys can have 
      the same tag, this feature lets you apply the permission to a select set of KMS keys. You can also 
      easily change the KMS keys in the set by changing their tags.
      In AWS KMS, the aws:ResourceTag/tag-key condition key is supported only in IAM policies. It 
      isn't supported in key policies, which apply only to one KMS key, or on operations that don't use a 
      particular KMS key, such as the ListKeys or ListAliases operations.
      Controlling access with tags provides a simple, scalable, and ﬂexible way to manage permissions. 
      However, if not properly designed and managed, it can allow or deny access to your KMS keys 
      inadvertently. If you are using tags to control access, consider the following practices.
      • Use tags to reinforce the best practice of least privileged access. Give IAM principals only the 
        permissions they need on only the KMS keys they must use or manage. For example, use tags to 
        label the KMS keys used for a project. Then give the project team permission to use only KMS 
        keys with the project tag.
      •
        Be cautious about giving principals the kms:TagResource and kms:UntagResource
        permissions that let them add, edit, and delete tags. When you use tags to control access to KMS 
        keys, changing a tag can give principals permission to use KMS keys that they didn't otherwise 
        have permission to use. It can also deny access to KMS keys that other principals require to do 
        their jobs. Key administrators who don't have permission to change key policies or create grants 
        can control access to KMS keys if they have permission to manage tags.
        Whenever possible, use a policy condition, such as aws:RequestTag/tag-key or
        aws:TagKeys to limit a principal's tagging permissions to particular tags or tag patterns on 
        particular KMS keys.
      • Review the principals in your AWS account that currently have tagging and untagging 
        permissions and adjust them, if necessary. For example, the console default key policy for key 
        administrators includes kms:TagResource and kms:UntagResource permission on that 
        KMS key. IAM policies might allow tag and untag permissions on all KMS keys. For example, the
        AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser managed policy allows principals to tag, untag, and list 
        tags on all KMS keys.
      • Before setting a policy that depends on a tag, review the tags on the KMS keys in your AWS 
        account. Make sure that your policy applies only to the tags you intend to include. Use CloudTrail 
        logs and CloudWatch alarms to alert you to tag changes that might aﬀect access to your KMS 
        keys.
      Use tags to control access to KMS keys                                                 597

      • The tag-based policy conditions use pattern matching; they aren't tied to a particular instance 
        of a tag. A policy that uses tag-based condition keys aﬀects all new and existing tags that match 
        the pattern. If you delete and recreate a tag that matches a policy condition, the condition 
        applies to the new tag, just as it did to the old one.
      For example, consider the following IAM policy. It allows the principals to call the
      GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext and Decrypt operations only on KMS keys in your account that 
      are the Asia Paciﬁc (Singapore) Region and have a "Project"="Alpha" tag. You might attach this 
      policy to roles in the example Alpha project.

     Key stores
     A key store is a secure location for storing and using cryptographic keys. The default key store in 
     AWS KMS also supports methods for generating and managing the keys that it stores. By default, 
     the cryptographic key material for the AWS KMS keys that you create in AWS KMS is generated in 
     and protected by hardware security modules (HSMs) that are FIPS 140-3 Cryptographic Module 
     Validation Program. Key material for your KMS keys never leave the HSMs unencrypted.
     AWS KMS supports several types of key stores to protect your key material when using AWS 
     KMS to create and manage your encryption keys. All of the key store options supplied by AWS 
     KMS are continually validated under FIPS 140-3 at Security Level 3 and are designed to prevent 
     anyone, including AWS operators, from accessing your plaintext keys or using them without your 
     permission.
     AWS KMS standard key store
     By default, a KMS key is created using the standard AWS KMS HSM. This HSM type can be thought 
     of as a multi-tenant ﬂeet of HSMs that allows for the most scalable, lowest cost and easiest key 
     store to manage from your perspective. If you are creating a KMS key for use within one or more 
     AWS services so that service can encrypt your data on your behalf, you will create a symmetric key. 
     If you are using a KMS key for your own application design, you may choose to create a symmetric 
     encryption key, asymmetric key, or HMAC key.
     In the standard key store option, AWS KMS creates your key, then encrypts it under keys that the 
     service manages internally. Multiple copies of encrypted versions of your keys are then stored 
     in systems that are designed for durability. Generating and protecting your key material in the 
     standard key store type lets you take full advantage of the scalability, availability, and durability of 
     AWS KMS with the lowest operational burden and cost of the AWS key stores.
     AWS KMS standard key store with imported key material
     Instead of asking AWS KMS to both generate and store the only copies of a given key, you 
     can choose to import key material into AWS KMS, allowing you to generate your own 256-bit 
     symmetric encryption key, RSA or elliptic curve (ECC) key, or Hash-Based Message Authentication 
     Code (HMAC) key, and apply it to a KMS key identiﬁer (keyId). This is sometimes referred to as
     bring your own key (BYOK). Imported key material from your local key management system must 
     be protected by using a public key issued by AWS KMS, a supported cryptographic wrapping 
     AWS KMS standard key store                                        600
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      algorithm, and a time-based import token provided by AWS KMS. This process veriﬁes that your 
      encrypted, imported key can only ever be decrypted by an AWS KMS HSM once it has left your 
      environment.
      Imported key material may be useful if you have speciﬁc requirements around the system 
      that generates keys, or want a copy of your key outside of AWS as a backup. Note that you are 
      responsible for an imported key material's overall availability and durability. While AWS KMS has 
      a copy of your imported key and will keep highly available while you need it, imported keys oﬀer 
      a special API for deletion – DeleteImportedKeyMaterial. This API will immediately delete all copies 
      of the imported key material that AWS KMS has, with no option for AWS to recover the key. In 
      addition, you can set an expiration time on an imported key, after which the key will be unusable. 
      To make the key useful again in AWS KMS, you will have to reimport the key material and assign it 
      to the same keyId. This deletion action for imported keys is diﬀerent than standard keys that AWS 
      KMS generates and stored for you on your behalf. In the standard case, the key deletion process 
      has a mandatory waiting period where a key scheduled for deletion is ﬁrst blocked from usage. 
      This action allows you to see access denied errors in logs from any application or AWS service that 
      might need that key to access data. If you see such access requests, you can choose to cancel the 
      scheduled deletion and re-enable the key. After a conﬁgurable waiting period (between 7 and 30 
      days), only then will KMS actually delete the key material, the keyID and all metadata associated 
      with the key. For more information about availability and durability, see Protecting imported key 
      material in the AWS KMS Developer Guide.
      There are some additional limitations with imported key material to be aware of. Since AWS KMS 
      cannot generate new key material, there is no way to conﬁgure automatic rotation of imported 
      keys. You will need to create a new KMS key with a new keyId, then import new key material to 
      achieve an eﬀective rotation. Also, ciphertexts created in AWS KMS under an imported symmetric 
      key cannot be easily decrypted using your local copy of the key outside of AWS. This is because the 
      authenticated encryption format used by AWS KMS appends additional metadata to the ciphertext 
      to provide assurances during the decryption operation that the ciphertext was created by the 
      expected KMS key under a previous encrypt operation. Most external cryptographic systems won’t 
      understand how to parse this metadata to gain access to the raw ciphertext to be able to use their 
      copy of a symmetric key. Ciphertexts created under imported asymmetric keys (e.g. RSA or ECC) 
      can be used outside of AWS KMS with the matching (public or private) portion of the key because 
      there is no additional metadata added by AWS KMS to the ciphertext.
      AWS KMS custom key stores
      However, if you require even more control of the HSMs, you can create a custom key store.
      AWS KMS custom key stores                                                               601
      AWS Key Management Service                                                    Developer Guide
      A custom key store is a key store within AWS KMS that is backed by a key manager outside of AWS 
      KMS, which you own and manage. Custom key stores combine the convenient and comprehensive 
      key management interface of AWS KMS with the ability to own and control the key material 
      and cryptographic operations. When you use a KMS key in a custom key store, the cryptographic 
      operations are performed by your key manager using your cryptographic keys. As a result, you 
      assume more responsibility for the availability and durability of cryptographic keys, and for the 
      operation of the HSMs.
      Owning your HSMs may be useful to help meet certain regulatory requirements that don’t yet 
      allow multi-tenant web services like the standard KMS key store to hold your cryptographic keys. 
      Custom key stores are not more secure than KMS key store that use AWS-managed HSMs, but 
      they have diﬀerent (and higher) management and cost implications. As a result, you assume more 
      responsibility for the availability and durability of cryptographic keys and for the operation of the 
      HSMs. Regardless of whether you use the standard key store with AWS KMS HSMs or a custom key 
      store, the service is designed so that no one, including AWS employees, can retrieve your plaintext 
      keys or use them without your permission. AWS KMS supports two types of custom key stores, AWS 
      CloudHSM key stores and external key stores.
      Unsupported features
      AWS KMS does not support the following features in custom key stores.
      • Asymmetric KMS keys
      • HMAC KMS keys
      • KMS keys with imported key material
      • Automatic key rotation
      • Multi-Region keys
      AWS CloudHSM key store
      You can create a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store, where root user keys are generated, 
      stored and used in a AWS CloudHSM cluster that you own and manage. Requests to AWS KMS 
      to use a key for some cryptographic operation are forwarded to your AWS CloudHSM cluster to 
      perform the operation. While a AWS CloudHSM cluster is hosted by AWS, it is a single-tenant 
      solution that is directly managed and operated by you. You own much of the availability and 
      performance of KMS keys in a AWS CloudHSM cluster. To see if a AWS CloudHSM custom key store

     is a good ﬁt for your requirements, read Are AWS KMS custom key stores right for you?  on the 
     AWS security blog.
     External key store
     You can conﬁgure AWS KMS to use an External Key Store (XKS), where root user keys are 
     generated, stored and used in a key management system outside the AWS Cloud. Requests to AWS 
     KMS to use a key for some cryptographic operation are forwarded to your externally hosted system 
     to perform the operation. Speciﬁcally, requests are forwarded to an XKS Proxy in your network, 
     which then forwards the request to whichever cryptographic system you use. The XKS Proxy is 
     an open-source speciﬁcation that anyone can integrate with. Many commercial key management 
     vendors support the XKS Proxy speciﬁcation. Because an External Key Store is hosted by you or 
     some third party, you own all of the availability, durability, and performance of the keys in the 
     system. To see if an External Key Store is a good ﬁt for your requirements, read Announcing AWS 
     KMS External Key Store (XKS)  on the AWS News blog.
     AWS CloudHSM key stores
     An AWS CloudHSM key store is a custom key store backed by a AWS CloudHSM cluster. When you 
     create an AWS KMS key in a custom key store, AWS KMS generates and stores non-extractable key 
     material for the KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM cluster that you own and manage. When you use 
     a KMS key in a custom key store, the cryptographic operations are performed in the HSMs in the 
     cluster. This feature combines the convenience and widespread integration of AWS KMS with the 
     added control of an AWS CloudHSM cluster in your AWS account.
     AWS KMS provides full console and API support for creating, using, and managing your custom key 
     stores. You can use the KMS keys in your custom key store the same way that you use any KMS key. 
     For example, you can use the KMS keys to generate data keys and encrypt data. You can also use 
     the KMS keys in your custom key store with AWS services that support customer managed keys.
     Do I need a custom key store?
     For most users, the default AWS KMS key store, which is protected by FIPS 140-3 validated 
     cryptographic modules, fulﬁlls their security requirements. There is no need to add an extra layer 
     of maintenance responsibility or a dependency on an additional service.
     However, you might consider creating a custom key store if your organization has any of the 
     following requirements:
     External key store                                                     603
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
      • You have keys that are explicitly required to be protected in a single tenant HSM or in an HSM 
        that you have direct control over.
      • You need the ability to immediately remove key material from AWS KMS.
      • You need to be able to audit all use of your keys independently of AWS KMS or AWS CloudTrail.
      How do custom key stores work?
      Each custom key store is associated with an AWS CloudHSM cluster in your AWS account. When you 
      connect the custom key store to its cluster, AWS KMS creates the network infrastructure to support 
      the connection. Then it logs into the key AWS CloudHSM client in the cluster using the credentials 
      of a dedicated crypto user in the cluster.
      You create and manage your custom key stores in AWS KMS and create and manage your HSM 
      clusters in AWS CloudHSM. When you create AWS KMS keys in an AWS KMS custom key store, you 
      view and manage the KMS keys in AWS KMS. But you can also view and manage their key material 
      in AWS CloudHSM, just as you would do for other keys in the cluster.
      You can create symmetric encryption KMS keys with key material generated by AWS KMS in your 
      custom key store. Then use the same techniques to view and manage the KMS keys in your custom 
      key store that you use for KMS keys in the AWS KMS key store. You can control access with IAM and 
      key policies, create tags and aliases, enable and disable the KMS keys, and schedule key deletion. 
      AWS CloudHSM key stores                                                               604
      AWS Key Management Service                                              Developer Guide
      You can use the KMS keys for cryptographic operations and use them with AWS services that 
      integrate with AWS KMS.
      In addition, you have full control over the AWS CloudHSM cluster, including creating and deleting 
      HSMs and managing backups. You can use the AWS CloudHSM client and supported software 
      libraries to view, audit, and manage the key material for your KMS keys. While the custom key store 
      is disconnected, AWS KMS cannot access it, and users cannot use the KMS keys in the custom key 
      store for cryptographic operations. This added layer of control makes custom key stores a powerful 
      solution for organizations that require it.
      Where do I start?
      To create and manage an AWS CloudHSM key store, you use features of AWS KMS and AWS 
      CloudHSM.
      1. Start in AWS CloudHSM. Create an active AWS CloudHSM cluster or select an existing cluster. 
        The cluster must have at least two active HSMs in diﬀerent Availability Zones. Then create a
        dedicated crypto user (CU) account in that cluster for AWS KMS.
      2. In AWS KMS, create a custom key store that is associated with your selected AWS CloudHSM 
        cluster. AWS KMS provides a complete management interface that lets you create, view, edit, 
        and delete your custom key stores.
      3. When you're ready to use your custom key store, connect it to its associated AWS CloudHSM 
        cluster. AWS KMS creates the network infrastructure that it needs to support the connection. It 
        then logs in to the cluster using the dedicated crypto user account credentials so it can generate 
        and manage key material in the cluster.
      4. Now, you can create symmetric encryption KMS keys in your custom key store. Just specify the 
        custom key store when you create the KMS key.
      If you get stuck at any point, you can ﬁnd help in the Troubleshooting a custom key store topic. If 
      your question is not answered, use the feedback link at the bottom of each page of this guide or 
      post a question on the AWS Key Management Service Discussion Forum.
      Quotas
      AWS KMS allows up to 10 custom key stores in each AWS account and Region, including both AWS 
      CloudHSM key stores and external key stores, regardless of their connection state. In addition, 
      there are AWS KMS request quotas on the use of KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store.

      AWS CloudHSM key store concepts
      This topic explains some of the terms and concepts used in AWS CloudHSM key stores.
      AWS CloudHSM key store
      An AWS CloudHSM key store is a custom key store associated with an AWS CloudHSM cluster that 
      you own and manage. AWS CloudHSM clusters are backed by hardware security modules (HSMs) 
      certiﬁed at FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3Level 3.
      When you create a KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS generates a 256-bit, 
      persistent, non-exportable Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric key in the associated 
      AWS CloudHSM cluster. This key material never leaves your HSMs unencrypted. When you use a 
      KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store, the cryptographic operations are performed in the HSMs 
      in the cluster.
      AWS CloudHSM key stores combine the convenient and comprehensive key management interface 
      of AWS KMS with the additional controls provided by an AWS CloudHSM cluster in your AWS 
      AWS CloudHSM key store concepts                                                         606

     account. This integrated feature lets you create, manage, and use KMS keys in AWS KMS while 
     maintaining full control of the HSMs that store their key material, including managing clusters, 
     HSMs, and backups. You can use the AWS KMS console and APIs to manage the AWS CloudHSM 
     key store and its KMS keys. You can also use the AWS CloudHSM console, APIs, client software, and 
     associated software libraries to manage the associated cluster.
     You can view and manage your AWS CloudHSM key store, edit its properties, and connect and
     disconnect it from its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. If you need to delete an AWS CloudHSM 
     key store, you must ﬁrst delete the KMS keys in the AWS CloudHSM key store by scheduling their 
     deletion and waiting until the grace period expires. Deleting the AWS CloudHSM key store removes 
     the resource from AWS KMS, but it does not aﬀect your AWS CloudHSM cluster.
     AWS CloudHSM cluster
     Every AWS CloudHSM key store is associated with one AWS CloudHSM cluster. When you create an 
     AWS KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS creates its key material in the associated 
     cluster. When you use a KMS key in your AWS CloudHSM key store, the cryptographic operation is 
     performed in the associated cluster.
     Each AWS CloudHSM cluster can be associated with only one AWS CloudHSM key store. The cluster 
     that you choose cannot be associated with another AWS CloudHSM key store or share a backup 
     history with a cluster that is associated with another AWS CloudHSM key store. The cluster must be 
     initialized and active, and it must be in the same AWS account and Region as the AWS CloudHSM 
     key store. You can create a new cluster or use an existing one. AWS KMS does not need exclusive 
     use of the cluster. To create KMS keys in the AWS CloudHSM key store, its associated cluster it must 
     contain at least two active HSMs. All other operations require only one HSM.
     You specify the AWS CloudHSM cluster when you create the AWS CloudHSM key store, and you 
     cannot change it. However, you can substitute any cluster that shares a backup history with the 
     original cluster. This lets you delete the cluster, if necessary, and replace it with a cluster created 
     from one of its backups. You retain full control of the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster so you can 
     manage users and keys, create and delete HSMs, and use and manage backups.
     When you are ready to use your AWS CloudHSM key store, you connect it to its associated AWS 
     CloudHSM cluster. You can connect and disconnect your custom key store at any time. When a 
     custom key store is connected, you can create and use its KMS keys. When it is disconnected, you 
     can view and manage the AWS CloudHSM key store and its KMS keys. But you cannot create new 
     KMS keys or use the KMS keys in the AWS CloudHSM key store for cryptographic operations.

      kmsuser Crypto user
      To create and manage key material in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster on your behalf, AWS 
      KMS uses a dedicated AWS CloudHSM crypto user (CU) in the cluster named kmsuser. The kmsuser
      CU is a standard CU account that is automatically synchronized to all HSMs in the cluster and is 
      saved in cluster backups.
      Before you create your AWS CloudHSM key store, you create a kmsuser CU account in your AWS 
      CloudHSM cluster using the user create command in CloudHSM CLI. Then when you create the 
      AWS CloudHSM key store, you provide the kmsuser account password to AWS KMS. When you
      connect the custom key store, AWS KMS logs into the cluster as the kmsuser CU and rotates 
      its password. AWS KMS encrypts your kmsuser password before it stores it securely. When the 
      password is rotated, the new password is encrypted and stored in the same way.
      AWS KMS remains logged in as kmsuser as long as the AWS CloudHSM key store is connected. 
      You should not use this CU account for other purposes. However, you retain ultimate control of the
      kmsuser CU account. At any time, you can ﬁnd the keys that kmsuser owns. If necessary, you can
      disconnect the custom key store, change the kmsuser password, log into the cluster as kmsuser, 
      and view and manage the keys that kmsuser owns.
      For instructions on creating your kmsuser CU account, see Create the kmsuser Crypto User.
      KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store
      You can use the AWS KMS or AWS KMS API to create a AWS KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key 
      store. You use the same technique that you would use on any KMS key. The only diﬀerence is that 
      you must identify the AWS CloudHSM key store and specify that the origin of the key material is 
      the AWS CloudHSM cluster.
      When you create a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS creates the KMS key in AWS 
      KMS and it generates a 256-bit, persistent, non-exportable Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
      symmetric key material in its associated cluster. When you use the AWS KMS key in a cryptographic 
      operation, the operation is performed in the AWS CloudHSM cluster using the cluster-based AES 
      key. Although AWS CloudHSM supports symmetric and asymmetric keys of diﬀerent types, AWS 
      CloudHSM key stores support only AES symmetric encryption keys.
      You can view the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store in the AWS KMS console, and use the 
      console options to display the custom key store ID. You can also use the DescribeKey operation to 
      ﬁnd the AWS CloudHSM key store ID and AWS CloudHSM cluster ID.
      AWS CloudHSM key store concepts                                                         608
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
      The KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store work just like any KMS keys in AWS KMS. Authorized 
      users need the same permissions to use and manage the KMS keys. You use the same console 
      procedures and API operations to view and manage the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store. 
      These include enabling and disabling KMS keys, creating and using tags and aliases, and setting 
      and changing IAM and key policies. You can use the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store for 
      cryptographic operations, and use them with integrated AWS services that support the use of 
      customer managed keys However, you cannot enable automatic key rotation or import key material
      into a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store.
      You also use the same process to schedule deletion of a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store. 
      After the waiting period expires, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key from KMS. Then it makes a best 
      eﬀort to delete the key material for the KMS key from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. 
      However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its 
      backups.
      Control access to your AWS CloudHSM key store
      You use IAM policies to control access to your AWS CloudHSM key store and your AWS CloudHSM 
      cluster. You can use key policies, IAM policies, and grants to control access to the AWS KMS keys in 
      your AWS CloudHSM key store. We recommend that you provide users, groups, and roles only the 
      permissions that they require for the tasks that they are likely to perform.
      To support your AWS CloudHSM key stores, AWS KMS needs permission to get information about 
      your AWS CloudHSM clusters. It also needs permission to create the network infrastructure that 
      connects your AWS CloudHSM key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster. To get these permissions, 
      AWS KMS creates the AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceCustomKeyStores service-
      linked role in your AWS account. For more information, see Authorizing AWS KMS to manage AWS 
      CloudHSM and Amazon EC2 resources.
      When designing your AWS CloudHSM key store, be sure that the principals who use and manage it 
      have only the permissions that they require. The following list describes the minimum permissions 
      required for AWS CloudHSM key store managers and users.
      • Principals who create and manage your AWS CloudHSM key store require the following 
        permission to use the AWS CloudHSM key store API operations.
        •
          cloudhsm:DescribeClusters
        •
          kms:CreateCustomKeyStore

        •
          iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole
      • Principals who create and manage the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with your AWS 
        CloudHSM key store need permission to create and initialize an AWS CloudHSM cluster. This 
        includes permission to create or use an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), create subnets, and 
        create an Amazon EC2 instance. They might also need to create and delete HSMs, and manage 
        backups. For lists of the required permissions, see Identity and access management for AWS 
        CloudHSM in the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.
      • Principals who create and manage AWS KMS keys in your AWS CloudHSM key store require the 
        same permissions as those who create and manage any KMS key in AWS KMS. The default key 
        policy for a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store is identical to the default key policy for KMS 
        keys in AWS KMS. Attribute-based access control (ABAC), which uses tags and aliases to control 
        access to KMS keys, is also eﬀective on KMS keys in AWS CloudHSM key stores.
      • Principals who use the KMS keys in your AWS CloudHSM key store for cryptographic operations
        need permission to perform the cryptographic operation with the KMS key, such as kms:Decrypt. 
        You can provide these permissions in a key policy, IAM policy. But, they do not need any 
        additional permissions to use a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store.
      Create an AWS CloudHSM key store
      You can create one or several AWS CloudHSM key stores in your account. Each AWS CloudHSM key 
      store is associated with one AWS CloudHSM cluster in the same AWS account and Region. Before 
      you create your AWS CloudHSM key store, you need to assemble the prerequisites. Then, before 
      you can use your AWS CloudHSM key store, you must connect it to its AWS CloudHSM cluster.
           Notes
           KMS cannot communicate over IPv6 with AWS CloudHSM key stores.
           If you try to create an AWS CloudHSM key store with all of the same property values as 
           an existing disconnected AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS does not create a new AWS 
           CloudHSM key store, and it does not throw an exception or display an error. Instead, AWS

           KMS recognizes the duplicate as the likely consequence of a retry, and it returns the ID of 
           the existing AWS CloudHSM key store.
           You do not have to connect your AWS CloudHSM key store immediately. You can leave it 
           in a disconnected state until you are ready to use it. However, to verify that it is conﬁgured 
           properly, you might want to connect it, view its connection state, and then disconnect it.

         you create AWS KMS keys in your AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS creates the KMS key 
         metadata, such as an ID and Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in AWS KMS. It then creates the key 
         material in the HSMs of the associated cluster. You can create a new AWS CloudHSM cluster or 
         use an existing one. AWS KMS does not require exclusive access to the cluster.
         The AWS CloudHSM cluster that you select is permanently associated with the AWS CloudHSM 
         key store. After you create the AWS CloudHSM key store, you can change the cluster ID of the 
         associated cluster, but the cluster that you specify must share a backup history with the original 
         cluster. To use an unrelated cluster, you need to create a new AWS CloudHSM key store.
         The AWS CloudHSM cluster that you select must have the following characteristics:
         • The cluster must be active.
      Create an AWS CloudHSM key store                                                        611
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
           You must create the cluster, initialize it, install the AWS CloudHSM client software for your 
           platform, and then activate the cluster. For detailed instructions, see Getting started with 
           AWS CloudHSM in the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.
         • Mutual TLS (mTLS) is not enabled.
           KMS does not support mTLS for clusters. This setting must not be enabled.
         • The cluster must be in the same account and Region as the AWS CloudHSM key store. You 
           cannot associate an AWS CloudHSM key store in one Region with a cluster in a diﬀerent 
           Region. To create a key infrastructure in multiple Regions, you must create AWS CloudHSM 
           key stores and clusters in each Region.
         • The cluster cannot be associated with another custom key store in the same account and 
           Region. Each AWS CloudHSM key store in the account and Region must be associated with a 
           diﬀerent AWS CloudHSM cluster. You cannot specify a cluster that is already associated with a 
           custom key store or a cluster that shares a backup history with an associated cluster. Clusters 
           that share a backup history have the same cluster certiﬁcate. To view the cluster certiﬁcate of 
           a cluster, use the AWS CloudHSM console or the DescribeClusters operation.
           If you back up an AWS CloudHSM cluster to a diﬀerent Region, it is considered to be diﬀerent 
           cluster, and you can associate the backup with a custom key store in its Region. However, KMS 
           keys in the two custom key stores are not interoperable, even if they have the same backing 
           key. AWS KMS binds metadata to the ciphertext so it can be decrypted only by the KMS key 
           that encrypted it.
         • The cluster must be conﬁgured with private subnets in at least two Availability Zones in the 
           Region. Because AWS CloudHSM is not supported in all Availability Zones, we recommend 
           that you create private subnets in all Availability Zones in the region. You cannot reconﬁgure 
           the subnets for an existing cluster, but you can create a cluster from a backup with diﬀerent 
           subnets in the cluster conﬁguration.
                Important
                After you create your AWS CloudHSM key store, do not delete any of the private 
                subnets conﬁgured for its AWS CloudHSM cluster. If AWS KMS cannot ﬁnd all of the 
                subnets in the cluster conﬁguration, attempts to connect to the custom key store
                fail with a SUBNET_NOT_FOUND connection error state. For details, see How to ﬁx a 
                connection failure.

         •
           The security group for the cluster (cloudhsm-cluster-<cluster-id>-sg) must include 
           inbound rules and outbound rules that allow TCP traﬃc over IPv4, on ports 2223-2225. 
           The Source in the inbound rules and the Destination in the outbound rules must match the 
           security group ID. These rules are set by default when you create the cluster. Do not delete or 
           change them.
         • The cluster must contain at least two active HSMs in diﬀerent Availability Zones. To verify 
           the number of HSMs, use the AWS CloudHSM console or the DescribeClusters operation. If 
           necessary, you can add an HSM.
      Find the trust anchor certiﬁcate
         When you create a custom key store, you must upload the trust anchor certiﬁcate for the AWS 
         CloudHSM cluster to AWS KMS. AWS KMS needs the trust anchor certiﬁcate to connect the AWS 
         CloudHSM key store to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.
         Every active AWS CloudHSM cluster has a trust anchor certiﬁcate. When you initialize the 
         cluster, you generate this certiﬁcate, save it in the customerCA.crt ﬁle, and copy it to hosts 
         that connect to the cluster.
      Create the kmsuser crypto user for AWS KMS
         To administer your AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS logs into the kmsuser crypto user
         (CU) account in the selected cluster. Before you create your AWS CloudHSM key store, you must 
         create the kmsuser CU. Then when you create your AWS CloudHSM key store, you provide the 
         password for kmsuser to AWS KMS. Whenever you connect the AWS CloudHSM key store to its 
         associated AWS CloudHSM cluster, AWS KMS logs in as the kmsuser and rotates the kmsuser
         password
              Important
              Do not specify the 2FA option when you create the kmsuser CU. If you do, AWS KMS 
              cannot log in and your AWS CloudHSM key store cannot be connected to this AWS 
              CloudHSM cluster. Once you specify 2FA, you cannot undo it. Instead, you must delete 
              the CU and recreate it.
              Notes
              The following procedures use the AWS CloudHSM Client SDK 5 command line tool,
              CloudHSM CLI. The CloudHSM CLI replaces key-handle with key-reference.
      Create an AWS CloudHSM key store                                                        613
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
              On January 1, 2025, AWS CloudHSM will end support for the Client SDK 3 command 
              line tools, the CloudHSM Management Utility (CMU) and the Key Management Utility 
              (KMU). For more information on the diﬀerences between the Client SDK 3 command 
              line tools and the Client SDK 5 command line tool, see Migrate from Client SDK 3 CMU 
              and KMU to Client SDK 5 CloudHSM CLI in the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.
         1.  Follow the getting started procedures as described in the Getting started with CloudHSM 
             Command Line Interface (CLI) topic of the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.
         2.
             Use the user create command to create a CU named kmsuser.
             The password must consist of 7-32 alphanumeric characters. It is case-sensitive and cannot 
             contain any special characters.
             The following example command creates a kmsuser CU.
               aws-cloudhsm > user create --username kmsuser --role crypto-user
               Enter password:
               Confirm password:
               { 
                "error_code": 0, 
                "data": { 
                  "username": "kmsuser", 
                  "role": "crypto-user" 
                }
               }
      Create a new AWS CloudHSM key store
      After assembling the prerequisites, you can create a new AWS CloudHSM key store in the AWS KMS 
      console or by using the CreateCustomKeyStore operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      When you create an AWS CloudHSM key store in the AWS Management Console, you can add and 
      create the prerequisites as part of your workﬂow. However, the process is quicker when you have 
      assembled them in advance.
      Create an AWS CloudHSM key store                                                        614

      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, AWS CloudHSM key stores.
      4.  Choose Create a key store.
      5.  Enter a friendly name for the custom key store. The name must be unique among all custom 
          key stores in your account.
               Important
               Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
               displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      6.  Select an AWS CloudHSM cluster for the AWS CloudHSM key store. Or, to create a new AWS 
          CloudHSM cluster, choose the Create an AWS CloudHSM cluster link.
          The menu displays the AWS CloudHSM clusters in your account and region that are not already 
          associated with an AWS CloudHSM key store. The cluster must fulﬁll the requirements for 
          association with a custom key store.
      7.  Choose Choose ﬁle, and then upload the trust anchor certiﬁcate for the AWS CloudHSM 
          cluster that you chose. This is the customerCA.crt ﬁle that you created when you initialized 
          the cluster.
      8.
          Enter the password of the kmsuser crypto user (CU) that you created in the selected cluster.
      9.  Choose Create.
      When the procedure is successful, the new AWS CloudHSM key store appears in the list of 
      AWS CloudHSM key stores in the account and Region. If it is unsuccessful, an error message 
      appears that describes the problem and provides help on how to ﬁx it. If you need more help, see
      Troubleshooting a custom key store.
      If you try to create an AWS CloudHSM key store with all of the same property values as an existing
      disconnected AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS does not create a new AWS CloudHSM key store, 
      and it does not throw an exception or display an error. Instead, AWS KMS recognizes the duplicate 
      as the likely consequence of a retry, and it returns the ID of the existing AWS CloudHSM key store.
      Create an AWS CloudHSM key store                                                        615
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Next: New AWS CloudHSM key stores are not automatically connected. Before you can create AWS 
      KMS keys in the AWS CloudHSM key store, you must connect the custom key store to its associated 
      AWS CloudHSM cluster.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      You can use the CreateCustomKeyStore operation to create a new AWS CloudHSM key store that is 
      associated with an AWS CloudHSM cluster in the account and Region. These examples use the AWS 
      Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any supported programming language.
      The CreateCustomKeyStore operation requires the following parameter values.
      • CustomKeyStoreName – A friendly name for the custom key store that is unique in the account.
             Important
             Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
             displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      • CloudHsmClusterId – The cluster ID of an AWS CloudHSM cluster that fulﬁlls the requirements
        for an AWS CloudHSM key store.
      •
        KeyStorePassword – The password of kmsuser CU account in the speciﬁed cluster.
      •
        TrustAnchorCertiﬁcate – The content of the customerCA.crt ﬁle that you created when you
        initialized the cluster.
      The following example uses a ﬁctitious cluster ID. Before running the command, replace it with a 
      valid cluster ID.
        $ aws kms create-custom-key-store 
                --custom-key-store-name ExampleCloudHSMKeyStore \ 
                --cloud-hsm-cluster-id cluster-1a23b4cdefg \ 
                --key-store-password kmsPswd \ 
                --trust-anchor-certificate <certificate-goes-here>
      If you are using the AWS CLI, you can specify the trust anchor certiﬁcate ﬁle, instead of its 
      contents. In the following example, the customerCA.crt ﬁle is in the root directory.
        $ aws kms create-custom-key-store 
                --custom-key-store-name ExampleCloudHSMKeyStore \ 
      Create an AWS CloudHSM key store                                                        616
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
                --cloud-hsm-cluster-id cluster-1a23b4cdefg \ 
                --key-store-password kmsPswd \ 
                --trust-anchor-certificate file://customerCA.crt
      When the operation is successful, CreateCustomKeyStore returns the custom key store ID, as 
      shown in the following example response.
        { 
            "CustomKeyStoreId": cks-1234567890abcdef0
        }
      If the operation fails, correct the error indicated by the exception, and try again. For additional 
      help, see Troubleshooting a custom key store.
      If you try to create an AWS CloudHSM key store with all of the same property values as an existing
      disconnected AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS does not create a new AWS CloudHSM key store, 
      and it does not throw an exception or display an error. Instead, AWS KMS recognizes the duplicate 
      as the likely consequence of a retry, and it returns the ID of the existing AWS CloudHSM key store.
      Next: To use the AWS CloudHSM key store, connect it to its AWS CloudHSM cluster.
      View an AWS CloudHSM key store
      You can view the AWS CloudHSM key stores in each account and Region by using the AWS KMS 
      console or the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      When you view the AWS CloudHSM key stores in the AWS Management Console, you can see the 
      following:
      • The custom key store name and ID
      • The ID of associated AWS CloudHSM cluster
      • The number of HSMs in the cluster
      • The current connection state
      A connection state (Status) value of Disconnected indicates that the custom key store is new and 
      has never been connected, or it was intentionally disconnected from its AWS CloudHSM cluster. 
      View an AWS CloudHSM key store                                                          617

      However, if your attempts to use a KMS key in a connected custom key store fail, that might 
      indicate a problem with the custom key store or its AWS CloudHSM cluster. For help, see How to ﬁx 
      a failing KMS key.
      To view the AWS CloudHSM key stores in a given account and Region, use the following procedure.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, AWS CloudHSM key stores.
      To customize the display, click the gear icon that appears below the Create key store button.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To view your AWS CloudHSM key stores, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. By default, 
      this operation returns all custom key stores in the account and Region. But you can use either the
      CustomKeyStoreId or CustomKeyStoreName parameter (but not both) to limit the output to a 
      particular custom key store. For AWS CloudHSM key stores, the output consists of the custom key 
      store ID and name, the custom key store type, the ID of the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster, and 
      the connection state. If the connection state indicates an error, the output also includes an error 
      code that describes the reason for the error.
      The examples in this section use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any 
      supported programming language.
      For example, the following command returns all custom key stores in the account and Region. You 
      can use the Limit and Marker parameters to page through the custom key stores in the output.
        $ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores
      The following example command uses the CustomKeyStoreName parameter to get only the 
      custom key store with the ExampleCloudHSMKeyStore friendly name. You can use either the
      CustomKeyStoreName or CustomKeyStoreId parameter (but not both) in each command.
      The following example output represents an AWS CloudHSM key store that is connected to its AWS 
      CloudHSM cluster.

           Note
           The CustomKeyStoreType ﬁeld was added to the DescribeCustomKeyStores response 
           to distinguish AWS CloudHSM key stores from external key stores.
        $ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores --custom-key-store-name ExampleCloudHSMKeyStore
        { 
           "CustomKeyStores": [  
              {  
                 "CloudHsmClusterId": "cluster-1a23b4cdefg", 
                 "ConnectionState": "CONNECTED",

                 "CustomKeyStoreType": "AWS_CLOUDHSM", 
                 "TrustAnchorCertificate": "<certificate appears here>" 
              } 
           ]
        }
      A ConnectionState of Disconnected indicates that a custom key store has never been 
      connected or it was intentionally disconnected from its AWS CloudHSM cluster. However, if 
      attempts to use a KMS key in a connected AWS CloudHSM key store fail, that might indicate a 
      problem with the AWS CloudHSM key store or its AWS CloudHSM cluster. For help, see How to ﬁx a 
      failing KMS key.
      If the ConnectionState of the custom key store is FAILED, the DescribeCustomKeyStores
      response includes a ConnectionErrorCode element that explains the reason for the error.
      For example, in the following output, the INVALID_CREDENTIALS value indicates that the custom 
      key store connection failed because the kmsuser password is invalid. For help with this and other 
      connection error failures, see Troubleshooting a custom key store.
        $ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0

      To edit AWS CloudHSM key store settings:
      1.  Disconnect the custom key store from its AWS CloudHSM cluster.
          While the custom key store is disconnected, you cannot create AWS KMS keys (KMS keys) in the 
          custom key store and you cannot use the KMS keys it contains for cryptographic operations.
      2.  Edit one or more of the AWS CloudHSM key store settings.
          You can edit the following settings in a custom key store:
          The friendly name of the custom key store.
             Enter a new friendly name. The new name must be unique among all custom key stores in 
             your AWS account.

          The cluster ID of the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.
             Edit this value to substitute a related AWS CloudHSM cluster for the original one. You 
             can use this feature to repair a custom key store if its AWS CloudHSM cluster becomes 
             corrupted or is deleted.
             Specify an AWS CloudHSM cluster that shares a backup history with the original cluster and
             fulﬁlls the requirements for association with a custom key store, including two active HSMs 
             in diﬀerent Availability Zones. Clusters that share a backup history have the same cluster 
             certiﬁcate. To view the cluster certiﬁcate of a cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. 
             You cannot use the edit feature to associate the custom key store with an unrelated AWS 
             CloudHSM cluster.
          The current password of the kmsuser crypto user (CU).
             Tells AWS KMS the current password of the kmsuser CU in the AWS CloudHSM cluster. This 
             action does not change the password of the kmsuser CU in the AWS CloudHSM cluster.
             If you change the password of the kmsuser CU in the AWS CloudHSM cluster, use this 
             feature to tell AWS KMS the new kmsuser password. Otherwise, AWS KMS cannot log into 
             the cluster and all attempts to connect the custom key store to the cluster fail.
      3.  Reconnect the custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster.
      Edit your key store settings
      You can edit your AWS CloudHSM key store settings in the AWS KMS console or by using the
      UpdateCustomKeyStore operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      When you edit an AWS CloudHSM key store, you can change any or of the conﬁgurable values.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, AWS CloudHSM key stores.
      4.  Choose the row of the AWS CloudHSM key store you want to edit.
      Edit AWS CloudHSM key store settings                                                    621
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
          If the value in the Connection state column is not Disconnected, you must disconnect 
          the custom key store before you can edit it. (From the Key store actions menu, choose
          Disconnect.)
          While an AWS CloudHSM key store is disconnected, you can manage the AWS CloudHSM key 
          store and its KMS keys, but you cannot create or use KMS keys in the AWS CloudHSM key store.
      5.  From the Key store actions menu, choose Edit.
      6.  Do one or more of the following actions.
          • Type a new friendly name for the custom key store.
          • Type the cluster ID of a related AWS CloudHSM cluster.
          •
            Type the current password of the kmsuser crypto user in the associated AWS CloudHSM 
            cluster.
      7.  Choose Save.
          When the procedure is successful, a message describes the settings that you edited. When it is 
          unsuccessful, an error message appears that describes the problem and provides help on how 
          to ﬁx it. If you need more help, see Troubleshooting a custom key store.
      8.  Reconnect the custom key store.
          To use the AWS CloudHSM key store, you must reconnect it after editing. You can leave the 
          AWS CloudHSM key store disconnected. But while it is disconnected, you cannot create KMS 
          keys in the AWS CloudHSM key store or use the KMS keys in the AWS CloudHSM key store in
          cryptographic operations.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To change the properties of an AWS CloudHSM key store, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore
      operation. You can change multiple properties of a custom key store in the same command. If 
      the operation is successful, AWS KMS returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no 
      properties. To verify that the changes are eﬀective, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
      The examples in this section use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any 
      supported programming language.
      Edit AWS CloudHSM key store settings                                                    622
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Begin by using DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the custom key store from its AWS 
      CloudHSM cluster. Replace the example custom key store ID, cks-1234567890abcdef0, with an 
      actual ID.
        $ aws kms disconnect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      The ﬁrst example uses UpdateCustomKeyStore to change the friendly name of the AWS CloudHSM 
      key store to DevelopmentKeys. The command uses the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to 
      identify the AWS CloudHSM key store and the CustomKeyStoreName to specify the new name for 
      the custom key store.
        $ aws kms update-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 --new-
        custom-key-store-name DevelopmentKeys
      The following example changes the cluster that is associated with an AWS CloudHSM key store to 
      another backup of the same cluster. The command uses the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to 
      identify the AWS CloudHSM key store and the CloudHsmClusterId parameter to specify the new 
      cluster ID.
        $ aws kms update-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 --cloud-
        hsm-cluster-id cluster-1a23b4cdefg
      The following example tells AWS KMS that the current kmsuser password is ExamplePassword. 
      The command uses the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify the AWS CloudHSM key store 
      and the KeyStorePassword parameter to specify the current password.
        $ aws kms update-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 --key-
        store-password ExamplePassword
      The ﬁnal command reconnects the AWS CloudHSM key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster. You can 
      leave the custom key store in the disconnected state, but you must connect it before you can create 
      new KMS keys or use existing KMS keys for cryptographic operations. Replace the example custom 
      key store ID with an actual ID.
        $ aws kms connect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      Edit AWS CloudHSM key store settings                                                    623
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Connect an AWS CloudHSM key store
      New AWS CloudHSM key stores are not connected. Before you can create and use AWS KMS keys in 
      your AWS CloudHSM key store, you need to connect it to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. You 
      can connect and disconnect your AWS CloudHSM key store at any time, and view its connection 
      state.
      You are not required to connect your AWS CloudHSM key store. You can leave an AWS CloudHSM 
      key store in a disconnected state indeﬁnitely and connect it only when you need to use it. However, 
      you might want to test the connection periodically to verify that the settings are correct and it can 
      be connected.
           Note
           AWS CloudHSM key stores have a DISCONNECTED connection state only when the key 
           store has never been connected or you explicitly disconnect it. If your AWS CloudHSM key 
           store connection state is CONNECTED but you are having trouble using it, make sure that its 
           associated AWS CloudHSM cluster is active and contains at least one active HSMs. For help 
           with connection failures, see the section called “Troubleshooting a custom key store”.
      When you connect an AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS ﬁnds the associated AWS CloudHSM 
      cluster, connects to it, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the kmsuser crypto user (CU), and 
      then rotates the kmsuser password. AWS KMS remains logged into the AWS CloudHSM client as 
      long as the AWS CloudHSM key store is connected.
      To establish the connection, AWS KMS creates a security group named kms-<custom key store 
      ID> in the virtual private cloud (VPC) of the cluster. The security group has a single rule that allows 
      inbound traﬃc from the cluster security group. AWS KMS also creates an elastic network interface
      (ENI) in each Availability Zone of the private subnet for the cluster. AWS KMS adds the ENIs to the
      kms-<cluster ID> security group and the security group for the cluster. The description of each 
      ENI is KMS managed ENI for cluster <cluster-ID>.
      The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes.
      Before you connect the AWS CloudHSM key store, verify that it meets the requirements.

      • Its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must contain at least one active HSM. To ﬁnd the number 
        of HSMs in the cluster, view the cluster in the AWS CloudHSM console or use the DescribeClusters
        operation. If necessary, you can add an HSM.
      •
        The cluster must have a kmsuser crypto user (CU) account, but that CU cannot be logged into 
        the cluster when you connect the AWS CloudHSM key store. For help with logging out, see How 
        to log out and reconnect.
      •
        The connection state of the AWS CloudHSM key store cannot be DISCONNECTING or FAILED. To 
        view the connection state, use the AWS KMS console or the DescribeCustomKeyStores response. 
        If the connection state is FAILED, disconnect the custom key store, ﬁx the problem, and then 
        connect it.
      For help with connection failures, see How to ﬁx a connection failure.
      When your AWS CloudHSM key store is connected, you can create KMS keys in it and use existing 
      KMS keys in cryptographic operations.
      Connect and reconnect to your AWS CloudHSM key store
      You can connect, or reconnect, your AWS CloudHSM key store in the AWS KMS console or by using 
      the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      To connect an AWS CloudHSM key store in the AWS Management Console, begin by selecting the 
      AWS CloudHSM key store from the Custom key stores page. The connection process can take up to 
      20 minutes to complete.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, AWS CloudHSM key stores.
      4.  Choose the row of the AWS CloudHSM key store you want to connect.
          If the connection state of the AWS CloudHSM key store is Failed, you must disconnect the 
          custom key store before you connect it.
      5.  From the Key store actions menu, choose Connect.

      AWS KMS begins the process of connecting your custom key store. It ﬁnds the associated AWS 
      CloudHSM cluster, builds the required network infrastructure, connects to it, logs into the AWS 
      CloudHSM cluster as the kmsuser CU, and rotates the kmsuser password. When the operation 
      completes, the connection state changes to Connected.
      If the operation fails, an error message appears that describes the reason for the failure. Before 
      you try to connect again, view the connection state of your AWS CloudHSM key store. If it is Failed, 
      you must disconnect the custom key store before you connect it again. If you need help, see
      Troubleshooting a custom key store.
      Next: the section called “Create a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store”.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To connect a disconnected AWS CloudHSM key store, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation. 
      The associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must contain at least one active HSM and the connection 
      state cannot be FAILED.
      The connection process takes an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. Unless 
      it fails quickly, the operation returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. 
      However, this initial response does not indicate that the connection was successful. To determine 
      the connection state of the custom key store, see the DescribeCustomKeyStores response.
      The examples in this section use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any 
      supported programming language.
      To identify the AWS CloudHSM key store, use its custom key store ID. You can ﬁnd the ID on the
      Custom key stores page in the console or by using the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation with 
      no parameters. Before running this example, replace the example ID with a valid one.
        $ aws kms connect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      To verify that the AWS CloudHSM key store is connected, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores
      operation. By default, this operation returns all custom keys stores in your account and Region. But 
      you can use either the CustomKeyStoreId or CustomKeyStoreName parameter (but not both) 
      to limit the response to particular custom key stores. The ConnectionState value of CONNECTED
      indicates that the custom key store is connected to its AWS CloudHSM cluster.
      Connect an AWS CloudHSM key store                                                       626

           Note
           The CustomKeyStoreType ﬁeld was added to the DescribeCustomKeyStores response 
           to distinguish AWS CloudHSM key stores from external key stores.
        $ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
        { 
           "CustomKeyStores": [ 
              "CustomKeyStoreId": "cks-1234567890abcdef0", 
              "CustomKeyStoreName": "ExampleCloudHSMKeyStore", 
              "CloudHsmClusterId": "cluster-1a23b4cdefg", 
              "CustomKeyStoreType": "AWS_CLOUDHSM", 
              "TrustAnchorCertificate": "<certificate string appears here>",

               "ConnectionState": "CONNECTED"
           ],
        }
      If the ConnectionState value is failed, the ConnectionErrorCode element indicates the 
      reason for the failure. In this case, AWS KMS could not ﬁnd an AWS CloudHSM cluster in your 
      account with the cluster ID cluster-1a23b4cdefg. If you deleted the cluster, you can restore it 
      from a backup of the original cluster and then edit the cluster ID for the custom key store. For help 
      responding to a connection error code, see How to ﬁx a connection failure.

      Disconnect an AWS CloudHSM key store
      When you disconnect an AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS logs out of the AWS CloudHSM client, 
      disconnects from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster, and removes the network infrastructure 
      that it created to support the connection.
      While an AWS CloudHSM key store is disconnected, you can manage the AWS CloudHSM key 
      store and its KMS keys, but you cannot create or use KMS keys in the AWS CloudHSM key store. 
      The connection state of the key store is DISCONNECTED and the key state of KMS keys in the 
      custom key store is Unavailable, unless they are PendingDeletion. You can reconnect the AWS 
      CloudHSM key store at any time.
          Note
          AWS CloudHSM key stores have a DISCONNECTED connection state only when the key 
          store has never been connected or you explicitly disconnect it. If your AWS CloudHSM key 
          store connection state is CONNECTED but you are having trouble using it, make sure that its 
          associated AWS CloudHSM cluster is active and contains at least one active HSMs. For help 
          with connection failures, see the section called “Troubleshooting a custom key store”.
      When you disconnect a custom key store, the KMS keys in the key store become unusable right 
      away (subject to eventual consistency). However, resources encrypted with data keys protected by 
      the KMS key are not aﬀected until the KMS key is used again, such as to decrypt the data key. This 
      issue aﬀects AWS services, many of which use data keys to protect your resources. For details, see
      How unusable KMS keys aﬀect data keys.
          Note
          While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS keys in the custom 
          key store or to use existing KMS keys in cryptographic operations will fail. This action can 
          prevent users from storing and accessing sensitive data.
      To better estimate the eﬀect of disconnecting your custom key store, identify the KMS keys in the 
      custom key store and determine their past use.
      You might disconnect an AWS CloudHSM key store for reasons such as the following:

      •
        To rotate of the kmsuser password. AWS KMS changes the kmsuser password each time that 
        it connects to the AWS CloudHSM cluster. To force a password rotation, just disconnect and 
        reconnect.
      • To audit the key material for the KMS keys in the AWS CloudHSM cluster. When you disconnect 
        the custom key store, AWS KMS logs out of the kmsuser crypto user account in the AWS 
        CloudHSM client. This allows you to log into the cluster as the kmsuser CU and audit and 
        manage the key material for the KMS key.
      • To immediately disable all KMS keys in the AWS CloudHSM key store. You can disable and re-
        enable KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store by using the AWS Management Console or the
        DisableKey operation. These operations complete quickly, but they act on one KMS key at a time. 
        Disconnecting the AWS CloudHSM key store immediately changes the key state of all KMS keys 
        in the AWS CloudHSM key store to Unavailable, which prevents them from being used in any 
        cryptographic operation.
      • To repair a failed connection attempt. If an attempt to connect an AWS CloudHSM key store 
        fails (the connection state of the custom key store is FAILED), you must disconnect the AWS 
        CloudHSM key store before you try to connect it again.
      Disconnect your AWS CloudHSM key store
      You can disconnect your AWS CloudHSM key store in the AWS KMS console or by using the
      DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation.
      Disconnect using the AWS KMS console
      To disconnect a connected AWS CloudHSM key store in the AWS KMS console, begin by choosing 
      the AWS CloudHSM key store from the Custom Key Stores page.

      example ID with a valid one.
        $ aws kms disconnect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      To verify that the AWS CloudHSM key store is disconnected, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores
      operation. By default, this operation returns all custom keys stores in your account and Region. 
      But you can use either the CustomKeyStoreId and CustomKeyStoreName parameter (but 
      not both) to limit the response to particular custom key stores. The ConnectionState value of
      DISCONNECTED indicates that this example AWS CloudHSM key store is not connected to its AWS 
      CloudHSM cluster.

      Delete an AWS CloudHSM key store
      When you delete an AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS deletes all metadata about the AWS 
      CloudHSM key store from KMS, including information about its association with an AWS CloudHSM 
      cluster. This operation does not aﬀect the AWS CloudHSM cluster, its HSMs, or its users. You can 
      create a new AWS CloudHSM key store that is associated with the same AWS CloudHSM cluster, but 
      you cannot undo the delete operation.
      You can only delete an AWS CloudHSM key store that is disconnected from its AWS CloudHSM 
      cluster and does not contain any AWS KMS keys. Before you delete a custom key store, do the 
      following.
      • Verify that you will never need to use any of the KMS keys in the key store for any cryptographic 
        operations. Then schedule deletion of all of the KMS keys from the key store. For help ﬁnding 
        the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store, see Find the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key 
        store.
      • Conﬁrm that all KMS keys have been deleted. To view the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key 
        store, see the section called “Identify KMS keys in AWS CloudHSM key stores”.
      • Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store from its AWS CloudHSM cluster.
      Instead of deleting the AWS CloudHSM key store, consider disconnecting it from its associated 
      AWS CloudHSM cluster. While an AWS CloudHSM key store is disconnected, you can manage the 
      AWS CloudHSM key store and its AWS KMS keys. But you cannot create or use KMS keys in the AWS 
      CloudHSM key store. You can reconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store at any time.
      Delete your AWS CloudHSM key store
      You can delete your AWS CloudHSM key store in the AWS KMS console or by using the
      DeleteCustomKeyStore operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      To delete an AWS CloudHSM key store in the AWS Management Console, begin by selecting the 
      AWS CloudHSM key store from the Custom key stores page.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, AWS CloudHSM key stores.
      4.  Find the row that represents the AWS CloudHSM key store that you want to delete. If the
          Connection state of the AWS CloudHSM key store is not Disconnected, you must disconnect 
          the AWS CloudHSM key store before you delete it.
      5.  From the Key store actions menu, choose Delete.
      When the operation completes, a success message appears and the AWS CloudHSM key store 
      no longer appears in the key stores list. If the operation is unsuccessful, an error message 
      appears that describes the problem and provides help on how to ﬁx it. If you need more help, see
      Troubleshooting a custom key store.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To delete an AWS CloudHSM key store, use the DeleteCustomKeyStore operation. If the operation 
      is successful, AWS KMS returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties.
      To begin, verify that the AWS CloudHSM key store does not contain any AWS KMS keys. You cannot 
      delete a custom key store that contains KMS keys. The ﬁrst example command uses ListKeys
      and DescribeKey to search for AWS KMS keys in the AWS CloudHSM key store with the example
      cks-1234567890abcdef0 custom key store ID. In this case, the command does not return any 
      KMS keys. If it does, use the ScheduleKeyDeletion operation to schedule deletion of each of the 
      KMS keys.
      Bash
           for key in $(aws kms list-keys --query 'Keys[*].KeyId' --output text) ;  
           do aws kms describe-key --key-id $key |  
           grep '"CustomKeyStoreId": "cks-1234567890abcdef0"' --context 100; done
      PowerShell
           PS C:\> Get-KMSKeyList | Get-KMSKey | where CustomKeyStoreId -eq 
            'cks-1234567890abcdef0'
      Next, disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store. This example command uses the
      DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect an AWS CloudHSM key store from its AWS 
      CloudHSM cluster. Before running this command, replace the example custom key store ID with a 
      valid one.
      Delete an AWS CloudHSM key store                                                        632

      Bash
           $ aws kms disconnect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      PowerShell
           PS C:\> Disconnect-KMSCustomKeyStore -CustomKeyStoreId cks-1234567890abcdef0
      After the custom key store is disconnected, you can use the DeleteCustomKeyStore operation to 
      delete it.
      Bash
           $ aws kms delete-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      PowerShell
           PS C:\> Remove-KMSCustomKeyStore -CustomKeyStoreId cks-1234567890abcdef0
      Troubleshooting a custom key store
      AWS CloudHSM key stores are designed to be available and resilient. However, there are some error 
      conditions that you might have to repair to keep your AWS CloudHSM key store operational.

      How to ﬁx unavailable KMS keys
      The key state of AWS KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store is typically Enabled. Like all KMS 
      keys, the key state changes when you disable the KMS keys in an AWS CloudHSM key store or 
      schedule them for deletion. However, unlike other KMS keys, the KMS keys in a custom key store 
      can also have a key state of Unavailable.
      A key state of Unavailable indicates that the KMS key is in a custom key store that was 
      intentionally disconnected and attempts to reconnect it, if any, failed. While a KMS key is 
      unavailable, you can view and manage the KMS key, but you cannot use it for cryptographic 
      operations.
      To ﬁnd the key state of a KMS key, on the Customer managed keys page, view the Status ﬁeld of 
      the KMS key. Or, use the DescribeKey operation and view the KeyState element in the response. 
      For details, see Identify and view keys.
      The KMS keys in a disconnected custom key store will have a key state of Unavailable or
      PendingDeletion. KMS keys that are scheduled for deletion from a custom key store have a
      Pending Deletion key state, even when the custom key store is disconnected. This allows you to 
      cancel the scheduled key deletion without reconnecting the custom key store.
      To ﬁx an unavailable KMS key, reconnect the custom key store. After the custom key store is 
      reconnected, the key state of the KMS keys in the custom key store is automatically restored to 
      its previous state, such as Enabled or Disabled. KMS keys that are pending deletion remain in 
      the PendingDeletion state. However, while the problem persists, enabling and disabling an 
      unavailable KMS key does not change its key state. The enable or disable action takes eﬀect only 
      when the key becomes available.
      For help with failed connections, see How to ﬁx a connection failure.
      How to ﬁx a failing KMS key
      Problems with creating and using KMS keys in AWS CloudHSM key stores can be caused by a 
      problem with your AWS CloudHSM key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster, the KMS key, or 
      its key material.
      When an AWS CloudHSM key store is disconnected from its AWS CloudHSM cluster, the key 
      state of KMS keys in the custom key store is Unavailable. All requests to create KMS keys in a 
      disconnected AWS CloudHSM key store return a CustomKeyStoreInvalidStateException
      Troubleshooting a custom key store                                                 634

      exception. All requests to encrypt, decrypt, re-encrypt, or generate data keys return a
      KMSInvalidStateException exception. To ﬁx the problem, reconnect the AWS CloudHSM key 
      store.
      However, your attempts to use a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store for cryptographic 
      operations might fail even when its key state is Enabled and the connection state of the AWS 
      CloudHSM key store is Connected. This might be caused by any of the following conditions.
      • The key material for the KMS key might have been deleted from the associated AWS CloudHSM 
        cluster. To investigate, ﬁnd the key id of the key material for a KMS key and, if necessary, try to
        recover the key material.
      • All HSMs were deleted from the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the AWS 
        CloudHSM key store. To use a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store in a cryptographic 
        operation, its AWS CloudHSM cluster must contain at least one active HSM. To verify the 
        number and state of HSMs in an AWS CloudHSM cluster, use the AWS CloudHSM console or the
        DescribeClusters operation. To add an HSM to the cluster, use the AWS CloudHSM console or the
        CreateHsm operation.
      • The AWS CloudHSM cluster associated with the AWS CloudHSM key store was deleted. To ﬁx the 
        problem, create a cluster from a backup that is related to the original cluster, such as a backup of 
        the original cluster, or a backup that was used to create the original cluster. Then, edit the cluster 
        ID in the custom key store settings. For instructions, see How to recover deleted key material for 
        a KMS key.
      • The AWS CloudHSM cluster associated with the custom key store did not have any available 
        PKCS #11 sessions. This typically occurs during periods of high burst traﬃc when additional 
        sessions are needed to service the traﬃc. To respond to a KMSInternalException with an 
        error message about PKCS #11 sessions, back oﬀ and retry the request again.
      How to ﬁx a connection failure
      If you try to connect an AWS CloudHSM key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, but the 
      operation fails, the connection state of the AWS CloudHSM key store changes to FAILED. To 
      ﬁnd the connection state of an AWS CloudHSM key store, use the AWS KMS console or the
      DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
      Alternatively, some connection attempts fail quickly due to easily detected cluster conﬁguration 
      errors. In this case, the connection state is still DISCONNECTED. These failures return an error 
      message or exception that explains why the attempt failed. Review the exception description and
      Troubleshooting a custom key store                                                    635

      cluster requirements, ﬁx the problem, update the AWS CloudHSM key store, if necessary, and try to 
      connect again.
      When the connection state is FAILED, run the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the
      ConnectionErrorCode element in the response.
           Note
           When the connection state of an AWS CloudHSM key store is FAILED, you must disconnect 
           the AWS CloudHSM key store before attempting to reconnect it. You cannot connect an 
           AWS CloudHSM key store with a FAILED connection state.
      •
        CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND indicates that AWS KMS cannot ﬁnd an AWS CloudHSM cluster with 
        the speciﬁed cluster ID. This might occur because the wrong cluster ID was provided to an API 
        operation or the cluster was deleted and not replaced. To ﬁx this error, verify the cluster ID, 
        such as by using the AWS CloudHSM console or the DescribeClusters operation. If the cluster 
        was deleted, create a cluster from a recent backup of the original. Then, disconnect the AWS 
        CloudHSM key store, edit the AWS CloudHSM key store cluster ID setting, and reconnect the AWS 
        CloudHSM key store to the cluster.
      •
        INSUFFICIENT_CLOUDHSM_HSMS indicates that the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster does not 
        contain any HSMs. To connect, the cluster must have at least one HSM. To ﬁnd the number of 
        HSMs in the cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. To resolve this error, add at least one 
        HSM to the cluster. If you add multiple HSMs, it's best to create them in diﬀerent Availability 
        Zones.
      •
        INSUFFICIENT_FREE_ADDRESSES_IN_SUBNET indicates that AWS KMS could not connect 
        the AWS CloudHSM key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster because at least one private subnet 
        associated with the cluster doesn't have any available IP addresses. An AWS CloudHSM key store 
        connection requires one free IP address in each of the associated private subnets, although two 
        are preferable.
        You can't add IP addresses (CIDR blocks) to an existing subnet. If possible, move or delete 
        other resources that are using the IP addresses in the subnet, such as unused EC2 instances or 
        elastic network interfaces. Otherwise, you can create a cluster from a recent backup of the AWS 
        CloudHSM cluster with new or existing private subnets that have more free address space. Then, 
        to associate the new cluster with your AWS CloudHSM key store, disconnect the custom key

      •
        INVALID_CREDENTIALS indicates that AWS KMS cannot log into the associated AWS CloudHSM 
        cluster because it doesn't have the correct kmsuser account password. For help with this error, 
        see How to ﬁx invalid kmsuser credentials.
      •
        NETWORK_ERRORS usually indicates transient network issues. Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key 
        store, wait a few minutes, and try to connect again.
      •
        SUBNET_NOT_FOUND indicates that at least one subnet in the AWS CloudHSM cluster 
        conﬁguration was deleted. If AWS KMS cannot ﬁnd all of the subnets in the cluster conﬁguration, 
        attempts to connect the AWS CloudHSM key store to the AWS CloudHSM cluster fail.
        To ﬁx this error, create a cluster from a recent backup of the same AWS CloudHSM cluster. (This 
        process creates a new cluster conﬁguration with a VPC and private subnets.) Verify that the new 
        cluster meets the requirements for a custom key store, and note the new cluster ID. Then, to 
        associate the new cluster with your AWS CloudHSM key store, disconnect the custom key store,
        change the cluster ID of the AWS CloudHSM key store to the ID of the new cluster, and try to 
        connect again.

      How to respond to a cryptographic operation failure
      A cryptographic operation that uses a KMS key in a custom key store might fail with a
      KMSInvalidStateException. The following error messages might accompany the
      KMSInvalidStateException.
        KMS cannot communicate with your CloudHSM cluster. This might be a transient network issue. 
        If you see this error repeatedly, verify that the Network ACLs and the security group rules for the 
        VPC of your AWS CloudHSM cluster are correct.
      • Although this is an HTTPS 400 error, it might result from transient network issues. To respond, 
        begin by retrying the request. However, if it continues to fail, examine the conﬁguration of your 
        networking components. This error is most likely caused by the misconﬁguration of a networking 
        component, such as a ﬁrewall rule or VPC security group rule that is blocking outgoing traﬃc. 
        For example, KMS cannot communicate with AWS CloudHSM clusters over IPv6. For details on

      How to ﬁx invalid kmsuser credentials
      When you connect an AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS logs into the associated AWS CloudHSM 
      cluster as the kmsuser crypto user (CU). It remains logged in until the AWS CloudHSM key store is 
      disconnected. The DescribeCustomKeyStores response shows a ConnectionState of FAILED and
      ConnectionErrorCode value of INVALID_CREDENTIALS, as shown in the following example.
      If you disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store and change the kmsuser password, AWS 
      KMS cannot log into the AWS CloudHSM cluster with the credentials of the kmsuser
      CU account. As a result, all attempts to connect the AWS CloudHSM key store fail. The

           ],
        }
      Also, after ﬁve failed attempts to log into the cluster with an incorrect password, AWS CloudHSM 
      locks the user account. To log into the cluster, you must change the account password.
      If AWS KMS gets a lockout response when it tries to log into the cluster as the kmsuser CU, 
      the request to connect the AWS CloudHSM key store fails. The DescribeCustomKeyStores
      Troubleshooting a custom key store                                                      639

      response includes a ConnectionState of FAILED and ConnectionErrorCode value of
      USER_LOCKED_OUT, as shown in the following example.
        $ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores --custom-key-store-name ExampleKeyStore
        { 
           "CustomKeyStores": [ 
              "CloudHsmClusterId": "cluster-1a23b4cdefg", 
              "ConnectionErrorCode": "USER_LOCKED_OUT"
              "CustomKeyStoreId": "cks-1234567890abcdef0", 
              "CustomKeyStoreName": "ExampleKeyStore", 
              "TrustAnchorCertificate": "<certificate string appears here>", 
              "CreationDate": "1.499288695918E9", 
               "ConnectionState": "FAILED"
           ],
        }
      To repair any of these conditions, use the following procedure.
      1.  Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store.
      2.  Run the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and view the value of the
          ConnectionErrorCode element in the response.
          •
            If the ConnectionErrorCode value is INVALID_CREDENTIALS, determine the current 
            password for the kmsuser account. If necessary, use the user change-password command 
            in CloudHSM CLI to set the password to a known value.
          •
            If the ConnectionErrorCode value is USER_LOCKED_OUT, you must use the user change-
            password command in CloudHSM CLI to change the kmsuser password.
      3.
          Edit the kmsuser password setting so it matches the current kmsuser password in the cluster. 
          This action tells AWS KMS which password to use to log into the cluster. It does not change the
          kmsuser password in the cluster.
      4.  Connect the custom key store.
      How to delete orphaned key material
      After scheduling deletion of a KMS key from an AWS CloudHSM key store, you might need to 
      manually delete the corresponding key material from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.
      When you create a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS creates the KMS key 
      metadata in AWS KMS and generates the key material in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. 
      Troubleshooting a custom key store                                                      640
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      When you schedule deletion of a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store, after the waiting 
      period, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key metadata. Then AWS KMS makes a best eﬀort to delete the 
      corresponding key material from the AWS CloudHSM cluster. The attempt might fail if AWS KMS 
      cannot access the cluster, such as when it's disconnected from the AWS CloudHSM key store or 
      the kmsuser password changes. AWS KMS does not attempt to delete key material from cluster 
      backups.
      AWS KMS reports the results of its attempt to delete the key material from the 
      cluster in the DeleteKey event entry of your AWS CloudTrail logs. It appears in the
      backingKeysDeletionStatus element of the additionalEventData element, as shown in 
      the following example entry. The entry also includes the KMS key ARN, the AWS CloudHSM cluster 
      ID, and the ID (backing-key-id) of the key material.

           Notes
           The following procedures use the AWS CloudHSM Client SDK 5 command line tool,
           CloudHSM CLI. The CloudHSM CLI replaces key-handle with key-reference.
           On January 1, 2025, AWS CloudHSM will end support for the Client SDK 3 command line 
           tools, the CloudHSM Management Utility (CMU) and the Key Management Utility (KMU). 
           For more information on the diﬀerences between the Client SDK 3 command line tools and 
           the Client SDK 5 command line tool, see Migrate from Client SDK 3 CMU and KMU to Client 
           SDK 5 CloudHSM CLI in the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.
      The following procedures demonstrate how to delete the orphaned key material from the 
      associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.
      1.  Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store, if it is not already disconnected, then login, as 
          explained in How to disconnect and log in.
               Note
               While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS keys in the 
               custom key store or to use existing KMS keys in cryptographic operations will fail. This 
               action can prevent users from storing and accessing sensitive data.
      2.  Use the key delete command in CloudHSM CLI to delete the key from the HSMs in the cluster.
          All CloudTrail log entries for cryptographic operation with a KMS key in a AWS CloudHSM 
          key store include an additionalEventData ﬁeld with the customKeyStoreId and
          backingKey. The value returned in the backingKeyId ﬁeld is the CloudHSM key id
      Troubleshooting a custom key store                                                      642
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
          attribute. We recommend ﬁltering the key delete operation by id to delete the orphaned key 
          material you identiﬁed in your CloudTrail logs.
          AWS CloudHSM recognizes the backingKeyId value as a hexadecimal value. To ﬁlter by id, 
          you must prepend the backingKeyId with Ox. For example, if the backingKeyId in your 
          CloudTrail log is 1a2b3c45678abcdef, you would ﬁlter by 0x1a2b3c45678abcdef.
          The following example deletes a key from the HSMs in your cluster. The backing-key-
          id is listed in the CloudTrail log entry. Before running this command, replace the example
          backing-key-id with a valid one from your account.
            aws-cloudhsm key delete --filter attr.id="0x<backing-key-id>"
            { 
              "error_code": 0, 
              "data": { 
                "message": "Key deleted successfully" 
              }
            }
      3.  Log out and reconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store as described in How to log out and 
          reconnect.
      How to recover deleted key material for a KMS key
      If the key material for an AWS KMS key is deleted, the KMS key is unusable and all ciphertext that 
      was encrypted under the KMS key cannot be decrypted. This can happen if the key material for 
      a KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM key store is deleted from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. 
      However, it might be possible to recover the key material.
      When you create an AWS KMS key (KMS key) in an AWS CloudHSM key store, AWS KMS logs into 
      the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster and creates the key material for the KMS key. It also changes 
      the password to a value that only it knows and remains logged in as long as the AWS CloudHSM 
      key store is connected. Because only the key owner, that is, the CU who created a key, can delete 
      the key, it is unlikely that the key will be deleted from the HSMs accidentally.
      However, if the key material for a KMS key is deleted from the HSMs in a cluster, the key state 
      of the KMS key eventually changes to UNAVAILABLE. If you attempt to use the KMS key for a 
      cryptographic operation, the operation fails with a KMSInvalidStateException exception. Most 
      importantly, any data that was encrypted under the KMS key cannot be decrypted.
      Troubleshooting a custom key store                                                      643
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Under certain circumstances, you can recover deleted key material by creating a cluster from a 
      backup that contains the key material. This strategy works only when at least one backup was 
      created while the key existed and before it was deleted.
      Use the following process to recover the key material.
      1. Find a cluster backup that contains the key material. The backup must also contain all users and 
         keys that you need to support the cluster and its encrypted data.
         Use the DescribeBackups operation to list the backups for a cluster. Then use the backup 
         timestamp to help you select a backup. To limit the output to the cluster that is associated with 
         the AWS CloudHSM key store, use the Filters parameter, as shown in the following example.
          $ aws cloudhsmv2 describe-backups --filters clusterIds=<cluster ID>
          { 
              "Backups": [ 
                  { 
                      "ClusterId": "cluster-1a23b4cdefg", 
                      "BackupId": "backup-9g87f6edcba", 
                      "CreateTimestamp": 1536667238.328, 
                      "BackupState": "READY" 
                  }, 
                       ... 
              ]
          }
      2. Create a cluster from the selected backup. Verify that the backup contains the deleted key and 
         other users and keys that the cluster requires.
      3. Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store so you can edit its properties.
      4. Edit the cluster ID of the AWS CloudHSM key store. Enter the cluster ID of the cluster that you 
         created from the backup. Because the cluster shares a backup history with the original cluster, 
         the new cluster ID should be valid.
      5. Reconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store.
      How to log in as kmsuser
      To create and manage the key material in the AWS CloudHSM cluster for your AWS CloudHSM key 
      store, AWS KMS uses the kmsuser crypto user (CU) account. You create the kmsuser CU account in 
      your cluster and provide its password to AWS KMS when you create your AWS CloudHSM key store.
      Troubleshooting a custom key store                                                      644
      AWS Key Management Service                                                    Developer Guide
      In general, AWS KMS manages the kmsuser account. However, for some tasks, you need to 
      disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store, log into the cluster as the kmsuser CU, and use the
      CloudHSM Command Line Interface (CLI).
           Note
           While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS keys in the custom 
           key store or to use existing KMS keys in cryptographic operations will fail. This action can 
           prevent users from storing and accessing sensitive data.
      This topic explains how to disconnect your AWS CloudHSM key store and log in as kmsuser, run 
      the AWS CloudHSM command line tool, and log out and reconnect your AWS CloudHSM key store.

           SDK 5 CloudHSM CLI in the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.
      1.  Disconnect the AWS CloudHSM key store, if it is not already disconnected. You can use the 
          AWS KMS console or AWS KMS API.
      Troubleshooting a custom key store                                                   645

          While your AWS CloudHSM key is connected, AWS KMS is logged in as the kmsuser. This 
          prevents you from logging in as kmsuser or changing the kmsuser password.
          For example, this command uses DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect an example key 
          store. Replace the example AWS CloudHSM key store ID with a valid one.
            $ aws kms disconnect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      2.  Use the login command to login as an admin. Use the procedures described in the Using 
          CloudHSM CLI section of the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.
            aws-cloudhsm > login --username admin --role admin
                      Enter password:
            { 
              "error_code": 0, 
              "data": { 
                "username": "admin", 
                "role": "admin" 
              }
            }
      3.  Use the user change-password command in CloudHSM CLI to change the password of the
          kmsuser account to one that you know. (AWS KMS rotates the password when you connect 
          your AWS CloudHSM key store.) The password must consist of 7-32 alphanumeric characters. It 
          is case-sensitive and cannot contain any special characters.
      4.
          Login as kmsuser using the password that you set. For detailed instructions, see the Using 
          CloudHSM CLI section of the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.
            aws-cloudhsm > login --username kmsuser --role crypto-user
                      Enter password:
            { 
              "error_code": 0, 
              "data": { 
                "username": "kmsuser", 
                "role": "crypto-user" 
              }
            }

      How to log out and reconnect
      Use the following procedure each time you need to log out as the kmsuser crypto user and 
      reconnect your key store.
           Notes
           The following procedures use the AWS CloudHSM Client SDK 5 command line tool,
           CloudHSM CLI. The CloudHSM CLI replaces key-handle with key-reference.
           On January 1, 2025, AWS CloudHSM will end support for the Client SDK 3 command line 
           tools, the CloudHSM Management Utility (CMU) and the Key Management Utility (KMU). 
           For more information on the diﬀerences between the Client SDK 3 command line tools and 
           the Client SDK 5 command line tool, see Migrate from Client SDK 3 CMU and KMU to Client 
           SDK 5 CloudHSM CLI in the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.
      1.  Perform the task, then use the logout command in CloudHSM CLI to log out. If you do not log 
          out, attempts to reconnect your AWS CloudHSM key store will fail.
            aws-cloudhsm   logout
            { 
              "error_code": 0, 
              "data": "Logout successful"
            }
      2.
          Edit the kmsuser password setting for the custom key store.
          This tells AWS KMS the current password for kmsuser in the cluster. If you omit this step, 
          AWS KMS will not be able to log into the cluster as kmsuser, and all attempts to reconnect 
          your custom key store will fail. You can use the AWS KMS console or the KeyStorePassword
          parameter of the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation.
          For example, this command tells AWS KMS that the current password is tempPassword. 
          Replace the example password with the actual one.
            $ aws kms update-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 --
            key-store-password tempPassword

      3.  Reconnect the AWS KMS key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster. Replace the example AWS 
          CloudHSM key store ID with a valid one. During the connection process, AWS KMS changes the
          kmsuser password to a value that only it knows.
          The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation returns quickly, but the connection process can take an 
          extended period of time. The initial response does not indicate the success of the connection 
          process.
            $ aws kms connect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      4.  Use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation to verify that the AWS CloudHSM key store is 
          connected. Replace the example AWS CloudHSM key store ID with a valid one.
          In this example, the connection state ﬁeld shows that the AWS CloudHSM key store is now

      External key stores
      External key stores allow you to protect your AWS resources using cryptographic keys outside 
      of AWS. This advanced feature is designed for regulated workloads that you must protect with 
      encryption keys stored in an external key management system that you control. External key stores 
      support the AWS digital sovereignty pledge to give you sovereign control over your data in AWS, 
      including the ability to encrypt with key material that you own and control outside of AWS.
      An external key store is a custom key store backed by an external key manager that you own and 
      manage outside of AWS. Your external key manager can be a physical or virtual hardware security 
      External key stores                                                                     648
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     modules (HSMs), or any hardware-based or software-based system capable of generating and 
     using cryptographic keys. Encryption and decryption operations that use a KMS key in an external 
     key store are performed by your external key manager using your cryptographic key material, a 
     feature known as hold your own keys (HYOKs).
     AWS KMS never interacts directly with your external key manager, and cannot create, view, 
     manage, or delete your keys. Instead, AWS KMS interacts only with external key store proxy (XKS 
     proxy) software that you provide. Your external key store proxy mediates all communication 
     between AWS KMS and your external key manager. It transmits all requests from AWS KMS to your 
     external key manager, and transmits responses from your external key manager back to AWS KMS. 
     The external key store proxy also translates generic requests from AWS KMS into a vendor-speciﬁc 
     format that your external key manager can understand, allowing you to use external key stores 
     with key managers from a variety of vendors.
     You can use KMS keys in an external key store for client-side encryption, including with the AWS 
     Encryption SDK. But external key stores are an important resource for server-side encryption, 
     allowing you to protect your AWS resources in multiple AWS services with your cryptographic keys 
     outside of AWS. AWS services that support customer managed keys for symmetric encryption also 
     support KMS keys in an external key store. For service support details, see AWS Service Integration.
     External key stores allow you to use AWS KMS for regulated workloads where encryption keys 
     must be stored and used outside of AWS. But they are a major departure from the standard shared 
     responsibility model, and require additional operational burdens. The greater risk to availability 
     and latency will, for most customers, exceed the perceived security beneﬁts of external key stores.
     External key stores let you control the root of trust. Data encrypted under KMS keys in your 
     external key store can be decrypted only by using the external key manager that you control. If 
     you temporarily revoke access to your external key manager, such as by disconnecting the external 
     key store or disconnecting your external key manager from the external key store proxy, AWS 
     loses all access to your cryptographic keys until you restore it. During that interval, ciphertext 
     encrypted under your KMS keys can't be decrypted. If you permanently revoke access to your 
     external key manager, all ciphertext encrypted under a KMS key in your external key store becomes 
     unrecoverable. The only exceptions are AWS services that brieﬂy cache the data keys protected by 
     your KMS keys. These data keys continue to work until you deactivate the resource or the cache 
     expires. For details, see How unusable KMS keys aﬀect data keys.
     External key stores unblock the few use cases for regulated workloads where encryption keys 
     must remain solely under your control and inaccessible to AWS. But this is a major change in the 
     way you operate cloud-based infrastructure and a signiﬁcant shift in the shared responsibility 
     External key stores                                               649
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     model. For most workloads, the additional operational burden and greater risks to availability and 
     performance will exceed the perceived security beneﬁts of external key stores.
     Do I need an external key store?
     For most users, the default AWS KMS key store, which is protected by FIPS 140-3 Security Level 3 
     validated hardware security modules, fulﬁlls their security, control, and regulatory requirements. 
     External key store users incur substantial cost, maintenance, and troubleshooting burden, and risks 
     to latency, availability and reliability.
     When considering an external key store, take some time to understand the alternatives, including 
     an AWS CloudHSM key store backed by an AWS CloudHSM cluster that you own and manage, and 
     KMS keys with imported key material that you generate in your own HSMs and can delete from 
     KMS keys on demand. In particular, importing key material with a very brief expiration interval 
     might provide a similar level of control without the performance or availability risks.
     An external key store might be the right solution for your organization if you have the following 
     requirements:
     • You are required to use cryptographic keys in your on-premises key manager or a key manager 
       outside of AWS that you control.
     • You must demonstrate that your cryptographic keys are retained solely under your control 
       outside of the cloud.
     • You must encrypt and decrypt using cryptographic keys with independent authorization.
     • Key material must be subject to a secondary, independent audit path.
     If you choose an external key store, limit its use to workloads that require protection with 
     cryptographic keys outside of AWS.
     Shared responsibility model
     Standard KMS keys use key material that is generated and used in HSMs that AWS KMS owns and 
     manages. You establish the access control policies on your KMS keys and conﬁgure AWS services 
     that use KMS keys to protect your resources. AWS KMS assumes responsibility for the security, 
     availability, latency, and durability of the key material in your KMS keys.
     External key stores                                               650
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      KMS keys in external key stores rely on key material and operations in your external key manager. 
      As such, the balance of responsibility shifts in your direction. You are responsible for the security, 
      reliability, durability, and performance of the cryptographic keys in your external key manager. 
      AWS KMS is responsible for responding promptly to requests and communicating with your 
      external key store proxy, and for maintaining our security standards. To ensure that every 
      external key store ciphertext at least as strong than standard AWS KMS ciphertext, AWS KMS ﬁrst 
      encrypts all plaintext with AWS KMS key material speciﬁc to your KMS key, and then sends it to 
      your external key manager for encryption with your external key, a procedure known as double 
      encryption. As a result, neither AWS KMS nor the owner of the external key material can decrypt 
      double-encrypted ciphertext alone.
      You are responsible for maintaining an external key manager that meet your regulatory and 
      performance standards, for supplying and maintaining an external key store proxy that conforms 
      to the AWS KMS External Key Store Proxy API Speciﬁcation, and for ensuring the availability and 
      durability of your key material. You must also create, conﬁgure, and maintain an external key 
      store. When errors arise that are caused by components that you maintain, you must be prepared 
      to identify and resolve the errors so that AWS services can access your resources without undue 
      disruption. AWS KMS provides troubleshooting guidance to help you determine the cause of 
      problems and the most likely resolutions.
      Review the Amazon CloudWatch metrics and dimensions that AWS KMS records for external 
      key stores. AWS KMS strongly recommends that you create CloudWatch alarms to monitor your 
      external key store so you can detect the early signs of performance and operational problems 
      before they occur.
      What is changing?
      External key stores support only symmetric encryption KMS keys. Within AWS KMS, you use and 
      manage KMS keys in an external key store in much the same way that you manage other customer 
      managed keys, including setting access control policies and monitoring key use. You use the same 
      APIs with the same parameters to request a cryptographic operation with a KMS key in an external 
      key store that you use for any KMS key. Pricing is also the same as for standard KMS keys. For 
      details, see KMS keys in external key stores and AWS Key Management Service Pricing.
      However, with external key stores the following principles change:
      • You are responsible for the availability, durability, and latency of key operations.
      • You are responsible for all costs for developing, purchasing, operating, and licensing your 
        external key manager system.
      External key stores                                                                     651
      AWS Key Management Service                                                    Developer Guide
      • You can implement independent authorization of all requests from AWS KMS to your external 
        key store proxy.
      • You can monitor, audit, and log all operations of your external key store proxy, and all operations 
        of your external key manager related to AWS KMS requests.
      Where do I start?
      To create and manage an external key store, you need to choose your external key store proxy 
      connectivity option, assemble the prerequisites, and create and conﬁgure your external key store.
      Quotas
      AWS KMS allows up to 10 custom key stores in each AWS account and Region, including both AWS 
      CloudHSM key stores and external key stores, regardless of their connection state. In addition, 
      there are AWS KMS request quotas on the use of KMS keys in an external key store.
      If you choose VPC proxy connectivity for your external key store proxy, there might also be quotas 
      on the required components, such as VPCs, subnets, and network load balancers. For information 
      about these quotas, use the Service Quotas console.
      Regions
      To minimize network latency, create your external key store components in the AWS Region closest 
      to your external key manager. If possible, choose a Region with a network round-trip time (RTT) of 
      35 milliseconds or less.
      External key stores are supported in all AWS Regions in which AWS KMS is supported except for 
      China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia).
      Unsupported features
      AWS KMS does not support the following features in custom key stores.
      • Asymmetric KMS keys
      • HMAC KMS keys
      • KMS keys with imported key material
      • Automatic key rotation

      External key store concepts
      Learn the basic terms and concepts used in external key stores.
      External key store
      An external key store is an AWS KMS custom key store backed by an external key manager outside 
      of AWS that you own and manage. Each KMS key in an external key store is associated with an
      external key in your external key manager. When you use a KMS key in an external key store for 
      encryption or decryption, the operation is performed in your external key manager using your 
      external key, an arrangement known as Hold your Own Keys (HYOK). This feature is designed for 
      organizations that are required to maintain their cryptographic keys in their own external key 
      manager.
      External key stores ensure that the cryptographic keys and operations that protect your AWS 
      resources remain in your external key manager under your control. AWS KMS sends requests to 
      your external key manager to encrypt and decrypt data, but AWS KMS cannot create, delete, or 
      manage any external keys. All requests from AWS KMS to your external key manager are mediated 
      by an external key store proxy software component that you supply, own, and manage.
      AWS services that support AWS KMS customer managed keys can use the KMS keys in your 
      external key store to protect your data. As a result, your data is ultimately protected by your keys 
      using your encryption operations in your external key manager.
      The KMS keys in an external key store have fundamentally diﬀerent trust models, shared 
      responsibility arrangements, and performance expectations than standard KMS keys. With 
      external key stores, you are responsible for the security and integrity of the key material and the 
      cryptographic operations. The availability and latency of KMS keys in an external key store are 
      aﬀected by the hardware, software, networking components, and the distance between AWS KMS 
      and your external key manager. You are also likely to incur additional costs for your external key 
      manager and for the networking and load balancing infrastructure you need for your external key 
      manager to communicate with AWS KMS
      External key store concepts                                                           653
      AWS Key Management Service                                             Developer Guide
      You can use your external key store as part of your broader data protection strategy. For each AWS 
      resource that you protect, you can decide which require a KMS key in an external key store and 
      which can be protected by a standard KMS key. This gives you the ﬂexibility to chose KMS keys for 
      speciﬁc data classiﬁcations, applications, or projects.
      External key manager
      An external key manager is a component outside of AWS that can generate 256-bit AES symmetric 
      keys and perform symmetric encryption and decryption. The external key manager for an external 
      key store can be a physical hardware security module (HSM), a virtual HSM, or a software key 
      manager with or without an HSM component. It can be located anywhere outside of AWS, 
      including on your premises, in a local or remote data center, or in any cloud. Your external key store 
      can be backed by a single external key manager or multiple related key manager instances that 
      share cryptographic keys, such as an HSM cluster. External key stores are designed to support a 
      variety of external managers from diﬀerent vendors. For details about connecting to your external 
      key manager, see Choose an external key store proxy connectivity option.
      External key
      Each KMS key in an external key store is associated with a cryptographic key in your external key 
      manager known as an external key. When you encrypt or decrypt with a KMS key in your external 
      key store, the cryptographic operation is performed in your external key manager using your 
      external key.
          Warning
          The external key is essential to the operation of the KMS key. If the external key is lost or 
          deleted, ciphertext encrypted under the associated KMS key is unrecoverable.
      For external key stores, an external key must be a 256-bit AES key that is enabled and can perform 
      encryption and decryption. For detailed external key requirements, see Requirements for a KMS 
      key in an external key store.
      AWS KMS cannot create, delete, or manage any external keys. Your cryptographic key material 
      never leaves your external key manager.When you create a KMS key in an external key store, you 
      provide the ID of an external key (XksKeyId). You cannot change the external key ID associated 
      with a KMS key, although your external key manager can rotate the key material associated with 
      the external key ID.
      External key store concepts                                                   654
      AWS Key Management Service                                               Developer Guide
      In addition to your external key, a KMS key in an external key store also has AWS KMS key material. 
      Data protected by the KMS key is encrypted ﬁrst by AWS KMS using the AWS KMS key material, 
      and then by your external key manager using your external key. This double encryption process 
      ensures that ciphertext protected by your KMS key is always at least as strong as ciphertext 
      protected only by AWS KMS.
      Many cryptographic keys have diﬀerent types of identiﬁers. When creating a KMS key in an 
      external key store, provide the ID of the external key that the external key store proxy uses to 
      refer to the external key. If you use the wrong identiﬁer, your attempt to create a KMS key in your 
      external key store fails.
      External key store proxy
      The external key store proxy ("XKS proxy") is a customer-owned and customer-managed software 
      application that mediates all communication between AWS KMS and your external key manager. 
      It also translates generic AWS KMS requests into a format that your vendor-speciﬁc external 
      key manager understand. An external key store proxy is required for an external key store. Each 
      external key store is associated with one external key store proxy.
      AWS KMS cannot create, delete, or manage any external keys. Your cryptographic key material 
      never leaves your external key manager. All communication between AWS KMS and your external 
      key manager is mediated by your external key store proxy. AWS KMS sends requests to the external 
      key store proxy and receives responses from the external key store proxy. The external key store 
      proxy is responsible for transmitting requests from AWS KMS to your external key manager and 
      transmitting responses from your external key manager back to AWS KMS
      You own and manage the external key store proxy for your external key store, and you are 
      responsible for its maintenance and operation. You can develop your external key store proxy 
      based on the open-source external key store proxy API speciﬁcation that AWS KMS publishes 
      External key store concepts                                                     655
      AWS Key Management Service                                                  Developer Guide
      or purchase a proxy application from a vendor. Your external key store proxy might be included 
      in your external key manager. To support proxy development, AWS KMS also provides a sample 
      external key store proxy (aws-kms-xks-proxy) and a test client (xks-kms-xksproxy-test-client) that 
      veriﬁes that your external key store proxy conforms to the speciﬁcation.
      To authenticate to AWS KMS, the proxy uses server-side TLS certiﬁcates. To authenticate to 
      your proxy, AWS KMS signs all requests to your external key store proxy with a SigV4 proxy 
      authentication credential. Optionally, your proxy can enable mutual TLS (mTLS) for additional 
      assurance that it only accepts requests from AWS KMS.
      Your external key store proxy must support HTTP/1.1 or later and TLS 1.2 or later with at least one 
      of the following cipher suites:
      • TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (TLS 1.3)
      • TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 (TLS 1.3)
             Note
             The AWS GovCloud (US) Region does not support TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256.
      • TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (TLS 1.2)
      • TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (TLS 1.2)
      To create and use the KMS keys in your external key store, you must ﬁrst connect the external key 
      store to its external key store proxy. You can also disconnect your external key store from its proxy 
      on demand. When you do, all KMS keys in the external key store become unavailable; they cannot 
      be used in any cryptographic operation.
      External key store proxy connectivity
      The external key store proxy connectivity ("XKS proxy connectivity") describes the method that 
      AWS KMS uses to communicate with your external key store proxy.
      You specify your proxy connectivity option when you create your external key store, and it becomes 
      a property of the external key store. You can change your proxy connectivity option by updating 
      the custom key store property, but you must be certain that your external key store proxy can still 
      access the same external keys.
      AWS KMS supports the following connectivity options:
      External key store concepts                                                         656
      AWS Key Management Service                                               Developer Guide
      • Public endpoint connectivity — AWS KMS sends requests for your external key store proxy over 
        the internet to a public endpoint that you control. This option is simple to create and maintain, 
        but it might not fulﬁll the security requirements for every installation.
      • VPC endpoint service connectivity — AWS KMS sends requests to a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud 
        (Amazon VPC) endpoint service that you create and maintain. You can host your external key 
        store proxy inside your Amazon VPC, or host your external key store proxy outside of AWS and 
        use the Amazon VPC only for communication.
      For details about the external key store proxy connectivity options, see Choose an external key 
      store proxy connectivity option.
      External key store proxy authentication credential
      To authenticate to your external key store proxy, AWS KMS signs all requests to your external key 
      store proxy with a Signature V4 (SigV4) authentication credential. You establish and maintain the 
      authentication credential on your proxy, then provide this credential to AWS KMS when you create 
      your external store.
           Note
           The SigV4 credential that AWS KMS uses to sign requests to the XKS proxy is unrelated 
           to any SigV4 credentials associated with AWS Identity and Access Management principals 
           in your AWS accounts. Do not reuse any IAM SigV4 credentials for your external key store 
           proxy.
      Each proxy authentication credential has two parts. You must provide both parts when creating an 
      external key store or updating the authentication credential for your external key store.
      • Access key ID: Identiﬁes the secret access key. You can provide this ID in plaintext.
      • Secret access key: The secret part of the credential. AWS KMS encrypts the secret access key in 
        the credential before storing it.
      You can edit the credential setting at any time, such as when you enter incorrect values, when 
      you change your credential on the proxy, or when your proxy rotates the credential. For technical 
      details about AWS KMS authentication to the external key store proxy, see Authentication in the 
      AWS KMS External Key Store Proxy API Speciﬁcation.
      External key store concepts                                                     657
       AWS Key Management Service                                                          Developer Guide
       To allow you to rotate your credential without disrupting the AWS services that use KMS keys in 
       your external key store, we recommend that the external key store proxy support at least two valid 
       authentication credentials for AWS KMS. This ensures that your previous credential continues to 
       work while you provide your new credential to AWS KMS.
       To help you track the age of your proxy authentication credential, AWS KMS deﬁnes an Amazon 
       CloudWatch metric, XksProxyCredentialAge. You can use this metric to create a CloudWatch alarm 
       that notiﬁes you when the age of your credential reaches a threshold you establish.
       To provide additional assurance that your external key store proxy responds only to AWS KMS, 
       some external key proxies support mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS). For details, see mTLS 
       authentication (optional).
       Proxy APIs
       To support an AWS KMS external key store, an external key store proxy must implement the 
       required proxy APIs as described in the AWS KMS External Key Store Proxy API Speciﬁcation. These 
       proxy API requests are the only requests that AWS KMS sends to the proxy. Although you never 
       send these requests directly, knowing about them might help you ﬁx any issues that might arise 
       with your external key store or its proxy. For example, AWS KMS includes information about the 
       latency and success rates of these API calls in its Amazon CloudWatch metrics for external key 
       stores. For details, see Monitor external key stores.
       The following table lists and describes each of the proxy APIs. It also includes the AWS KMS 
       operations that trigger a call to the proxy API and any AWS KMS operation exceptions related to 
       the proxy API.

       Double encryption
       Data encrypted by a KMS key in an external key store is encrypted twice. First, AWS KMS encrypts 
       the data with AWS KMS key material speciﬁc to the KMS key. Then the AWS KMS-encrypted 
       ciphertext is encrypted by your external key manager using your external key. This process is 
       known as double encryption.
       Double encryption ensures that data encrypted by a KMS key in an external key store is at least 
       as strong as ciphertext encrypted by a standard KMS key. It also protects your plaintext in transit 
       from AWS KMS to your external key store proxy. With double encryption, you retain full control of 
       your ciphertexts. If you permanently revoke AWS access to your external key through your external 
       proxy, any ciphertext remaining in AWS is eﬀectively crypto-shredded.
       External key store concepts                                                              659
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     To enable double encryption, each KMS key in an external key store has two cryptographic backing 
     keys:
     • An AWS KMS key material unique to the KMS key. This key material is generated and only used in 
       AWS KMS FIPS 140-3 Security Level 3 certiﬁed hardware security modules (HSMs).
     • An external key in your external key manager.
     Double encryption has the following eﬀects:
     • AWS KMS cannot decrypt any ciphertext encrypted by a KMS key in an external key store without 
       access to your external keys via your external key store proxy.
     • You cannot decrypt any ciphertext encrypted by a KMS key in an external key store outside of 
       AWS, even if you have its external key material.
     External key store concepts                                       660
     AWS Key Management Service                                   Developer Guide
     • You cannot recreate a KMS key that was deleted from an external key store, even if you have 
       its external key material. Each KMS key has unique metadata that it includes in the symmetric 
       ciphertext. A new KMS key would not be able to decrypt ciphertext encrypted by the original key, 
       even if it used the same external key material.
     For an example of double encryption in practice, see How external key stores work.
     How external key stores work
     Your external key store, external key store proxy, and external key manager work together to 
     protect your AWS resources. The following procedure depicts the encryption workﬂow of a typical 
     AWS service that encrypts each object under a unique data key protected by a KMS key. In this 
     case, you've chosen a KMS key in an external key store to protect the object. The example shows 
     how AWS KMS uses double encryption to protect the data key in transit and ensure that ciphertext 
     generated by a KMS key in an external key store is always at least as strong as ciphertext encrypted 
     by a standard symmetric KMS key with key material in AWS KMS.
     The encryption methods used by each actual AWS service that integrates with AWS KMS vary. For 
     details, see the "Data protection" topic in the Security chapter of the AWS service documentation.
     How external key stores work                                       661
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     1. You add a new object to your AWS service resource. To encrypt the object, the AWS service sends 
       a GenerateDataKey request to AWS KMS using a KMS key in your external key store.
     2. AWS KMS generates a 256-bit symmetric data key and prepares to send a copy of the plaintext 
       data key to your external key manager via your external key store proxy. AWS KMS begins the
       double encryption process by encrypting the plaintext data key with the AWS KMS key material
       associated with the KMS key in the external key store.
     3. AWS KMS sends an encrypt request to the external key store proxy associated with the external 
       key store. The request includes the data key ciphertext to be encrypted and the ID of the
       external key that is associated with the KMS key. AWS KMS signs the request using the proxy 
       authentication credential for your external key store proxy.
       The plaintext copy of the data key is not sent to the external key store proxy.
     4. The external key store proxy authenticates the request, and then passes the encrypt request to 
       your external key manager.
     How external key stores work                                      662
     AWS Key Management Service                                       Developer Guide
       Some external key store proxies also implement an optional authorization policy that allows 
       only selected principals to perform operations under speciﬁc conditions.
     5. Your external key manager encrypts the data key ciphertext using the speciﬁed external key. The 
       external key manager returns the double-encrypted data key to your external key store proxy, 
       which returns it to AWS KMS.
     6. AWS KMS returns the plaintext data key and the double-encrypted copy of that data key to the 
       AWS service.
     7. The AWS service uses the plaintext data key to encrypt the resource object, destroys the 
       plaintext data key, and stores the encrypted data key with the encrypted object.
       Some AWS services might cache the plaintext data key to use for multiple objects, or to reuse 
       while the resource is in use. For details, see How unusable KMS keys aﬀect data keys.
     To decrypt the encrypted object, the AWS service must send the encrypted data key back to 
     AWS KMS in a Decrypt request. To decrypt the encrypted data key, AWS KMS must send the 
     encrypted data key back to your external key store proxy with the ID of the external key. If the 
     decrypt request to the external key store proxy fails for any reason, AWS KMS cannot decrypt the 
     encrypted data key, and the AWS service cannot decrypt the encrypted object.
     Control access to your external key store
     All AWS KMS access control features — key policies, IAM policies, and grants — that you use with 
     standard KMS keys, work the same way for KMS keys in an external key store. You can use IAM 
     policies to control access to the API operations that create and manage external key stores. You use 
     IAM policies and key policies to control access to the AWS KMS keys in your external key store. You 
     can also use service control policies for your AWS organization and VPC endpoint policies to control 
     access to KMS keys in your external key store.
     We recommend that you provide users and roles only the permissions that they require for the 
     tasks that they are likely to perform.

      Authorizing external key store managers
      Principals who create and manage an external key store need permissions to the custom key store 
      operations. The following list describes the minimum permissions required for external key store 
      managers. Because a custom key store is not an AWS resource, you cannot provide permission to an 
      external key store for principals in other AWS accounts.
      •
        kms:CreateCustomKeyStore
      •
        kms:DescribeCustomKeyStores
      •
        kms:ConnectCustomKeyStore
      •
        kms:DisconnectCustomKeyStore
      •
        kms:UpdateCustomKeyStore
      •
        kms:DeleteCustomKeyStore
      Principals who create an external key store need permission to create and conﬁgure the external 
      key store components. Principals can create external key stores only in their own accounts. 
      To create an external key store with VPC endpoint service connectivity, principals must have 
      permission to create the following components:
      • An Amazon VPC
      • Public and private subnets
      • A network load balancer and target group
      • An Amazon VPC endpoint service
      For details, see Identity and access management for Amazon VPC, Identity and access management 
      for VPC endpoints and VPC endpoint services and Elastic Load Balancing API permissions.
      Authorizing users of KMS keys in external key stores
      Principals who create and manage AWS KMS keys in your external key store require the same 
      permissions as those who create and manage any KMS key in AWS KMS. The default key policy for 
      KMS key in an external key store is identical to the default key policy for KMS keys in AWS KMS.

      Attribute-based access control (ABAC), which uses tags and aliases to control access to KMS keys, is 
      also eﬀective on KMS keys in an external key stores.
      Principals who use the KMS keys in your custom key store for cryptographic operations need 
      permission to perform the cryptographic operation with the KMS key, such as kms:Decrypt. You can 
      provide these permissions in an IAM or key policy. But, they do not need any additional permissions 
      to use a KMS key in a custom key store.
      To set a permission that applies only to KMS keys in an external key store, use the kms:KeyOrigin
      policy condition with a value of EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE. You can use this condition to limit the
      kms:CreateKey permission or any permission that is speciﬁc to a KMS key resource. For example, 
      the following IAM policy allows the identity to which it is attached to call the speciﬁed operations 
      on all KMS keys in the account, provided that the KMS keys are in an external key store. Notice that 
      you can limit the permission to KMS keys in an external key store, and KMS keys in an AWS account, 
      but not to any particular external key store in the account.

      Authorizing AWS KMS to communicate with your external key store proxy
      AWS KMS communicates with your external key manager only through the external key store proxy
      that you provide. AWS KMS authenticates to your proxy by signing its requests using the Signature 
      Version 4 (SigV4) process with the external key store proxy authentication credential that you 
      specify. If you are using public endpoint connectivity for your external key store proxy, AWS KMS 
      does not require any additional permissions.
      Control access to your external key store                                               665
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      However, if you are using VPC endpoint service connectivity, you must give AWS KMS permission 
      to create an interface endpoint to your Amazon VPC endpoint service. This permission is required 
      regardless of whether the external key store proxy is in your VPC or the external key store proxy is 
      located elsewhere, but uses the VPC endpoint service to communicate with AWS KMS.
      To allow AWS KMS to create an interface endpoint, use the Amazon VPC console or the
      ModifyVpcEndpointServicePermissions operation. Allow permissions for the following principal:
      cks.kms.<region>.amazonaws.com.
      For example, the following AWS CLI command allows AWS KMS to connect to the speciﬁed VPC 
      endpoint service in the US West (Oregon) (us-west-2) Region. Before using this command, replace 
      the Amazon VPC service ID and AWS Region with valid values for your conﬁguration.
        modify-vpc-endpoint-service-permissions
        --service-id vpce-svc-12abc34567def0987
        --add-allowed-principals '["cks.kms.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"]'
      To remove this permission, use the Amazon VPC console or the
      ModifyVpcEndpointServicePermissions with the RemoveAllowedPrincipals parameter.
      External key store proxy authorization (optional)
      Some external key store proxies implement authorization requirements for the use of its external 
      keys. An external key store proxy is permitted, but not required, to design and implement an 
      authorization scheme that allows particular users to request particular operations only under 
      certain conditions. For example, a proxy might be conﬁgured to allow user A to encrypt with a 
      particular external key, but not to decrypt with it.
      Proxy authorization is independent of the SigV4-based proxy authentication that AWS KMS 
      requires for all external key store proxies. It is also independent of the key policies, IAM policies, 
      and grants that authorize access to operations aﬀecting the external key store or its KMS keys.
      To enable authorization by the external key store proxy, AWS KMS includes metadata in each proxy 
      API request, including the caller, the KMS key, the AWS KMS operation, the AWS service (if any). 
      The request metadata for version 1 (v1) of the external key proxy API is as follows.
        "requestMetadata": { 
            "awsPrincipalArn": string, 
            "awsSourceVpc": string, // optional 
            "awsSourceVpce": string, // optional 
      Control access to your external key store                                               666
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
            "kmsKeyArn": string, 
            "kmsOperation": string, 
            "kmsRequestId": string, 
            "kmsViaService": string // optional
        }
      For example, you might conﬁgure your proxy to allow requests from a particular principal 
      (awsPrincipalArn), but only when the request is made on the principal's behalf by a particular 
      AWS service (kmsViaService).
      If proxy authorization fails, the related AWS KMS operation fails with a message that explains the 
      error. For details , see Proxy authorization issues.
      mTLS authentication (optional)
      To enable your external key store proxy to authenticate requests from AWS KMS, AWS KMS signs 
      all requests to your external key store proxy with the Signature V4 (SigV4) proxy authentication 
      credential for your external key store.
      To provide additional assurance that your external key store proxy responds only to AWS KMS 
      requests, some external key proxies support mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS), in which 
      both parties to a transaction use certiﬁcates to authenticate to each other. mTLS adds client-side 
      authentication — where the external key store proxy server authenticates the AWS KMS client 
      — to the server-side authentication that standard TLS provides. In the rare case that your proxy 
      authentication credential is compromised, mTLS prevents a third party from making successful API 
      requests to the external key store proxy.
      To implement mTLS, conﬁgure your external key store proxy to accept only client-side TLS 
      certiﬁcates with the following properties:
      • The subject common name on the TLS certiﬁcate must be
        cks.kms.<Region>.amazonaws.com, for example, cks.kms.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com.
      • The certiﬁcate must be chained to a certiﬁcate authority associated with Amazon Trust Services.
      Choose an external key store proxy connectivity option
      Before creating your external key store, choose the connectivity option that determines how AWS 
      KMS communicates with your external key store components. The connectivity option that you 
      choose determines the remainder of the planning process.
      Choose a proxy connectivity option                                                      667

      If you are creating an external key store, you need to determine how AWS KMS communicates with 
      your external key store proxy. This choice will determine which components you need and how you 
      conﬁgure them. AWS KMS supports the following connectivity options. Choose the option that 
      meets your performance and security goals.
      Before you begin, conﬁrm that you need an external key store. Most customer can use KMS keys 
      backed by AWS KMS key material.
          Note
          If your external key store proxy is built into your external key manager, your connectivity 
          might be predetermined. For guidance, consult the documentation for your external key 
          manager or external key store proxy.
      You can change your external key store proxy connectivity option even on an operating external 
      key store. However, the process must be carefully planned and executed to minimize disruption, 
      avoid errors, and ensure continued access to the cryptographic keys that encrypt your data.
      Public endpoint connectivity
      AWS KMS connects to the external key store proxy (XKS proxy) over the internet using a public 
      endpoint.
      This connectivity option is easier to set up and maintain, and it aligns well with some models of key 
      management. However, it might not fulﬁll the security requirements of some organizations.

      Requirements
      If you choose public endpoint connectivity, the following are required.
      • Your external key store proxy must be reachable at a publicly routable endpoint.
      • You can use the same public endpoint for multiple external key stores provided that they use 
        diﬀerent proxy URI path values.
      • You cannot use the same endpoint for an external key store with public endpoint connectivity 
        and any external key store with VPC endpoint services connectivity in the same AWS Region, 
        even if the key stores are in diﬀerent AWS accounts.
      • You must obtain a TLS certiﬁcate issued by a public certiﬁcate authority supported for external 
        key stores. For a list, see Trusted Certiﬁcate Authorities.
        The subject common name (CN) on the TLS certiﬁcate must match the domain name in the
        proxy URI endpoint for the external key store proxy. For example, if the public endpoint is
        https://myproxy.xks.example.com, the TLS, the CN on the TLS certiﬁcate must be
        myproxy.xks.example.com or *.xks.example.com.
      • Ensure that any ﬁrewalls between AWS KMS and the external key store proxy allow traﬃc to and 
        from port 443 on the proxy. AWS KMS communicates on port 443 over IPv4. This value is not 
        conﬁgurable.

      For all requirements for an external key store, see the Assemble the prerequisites.
      VPC endpoint service connectivity
      AWS KMS connects to the external key store proxy (XKS proxy) by creating an interface endpoint 
      to an Amazon VPC endpoint service that you create and conﬁgure. You are responsible for creating 
      the VPC endpoint service and for connecting your VPC to your external key manager.
      Your endpoint service can use any of the supported network-to-Amazon VPC options for 
      communications, including AWS Direct Connect.
      This connectivity option is more complicated to set up and maintain. But it uses AWS PrivateLink, 
      which enables AWS KMS to privately connect to your Amazon VPC and your external key store 
      proxy without using the public internet.
      You can locate your external key store proxy in your Amazon VPC.
      Or, locate your external key store proxy outside of AWS and use your Amazon VPC endpoint service 
      only for secure communication with AWS KMS.

      • Review the process for creating an external key store, including assembling the prerequisites. 
        It will help you to ensure that you have all of the components you need when you create your 
        external key store.
      • Learn how to control access to your external key store, including the permissions that external 
        key store administrators and users require.
      • Learn about the Amazon CloudWatch metrics and dimensions that AWS KMS records for external 
        key stores. We strongly recommend that you create alarms to monitor your external key store so 
        you can detect the early signs of performance and operational problems.
      Conﬁgure VPC endpoint service connectivity
      Use the guidance in this section to create and conﬁgure the AWS resources and related 
      components that are required for an external key store that uses VPC endpoint service 
      connectivity. The resources listed for this connectivity option are a supplement to the resources 
      required for all external key stores. After you create and conﬁgure the required resources, you can
      create your external key store.
      You can locate your external key store proxy in your Amazon VPC or locate the proxy outside of 
      AWS and use your VPC endpoint service for communication.
      Before you begin, conﬁrm that you need an external key store. Most customer can use KMS keys 
      backed by AWS KMS key material.

          Note
          Some of the elements required for VPC endpoint service connectivity might be included 
          in your external key manager. Also, your software might have additional conﬁguration 
          requirements. Before creating and conﬁguring the AWS resources in this section, consult 
          your proxy and key manager documentation.

      Requirements for VPC endpoint service connectivity
      If you choose VPC endpoint service connectivity for your external key store, the following resources 
      are required.
      To minimize network latency, create your AWS components in the supported AWS Region that is 
      closest to your external key manager. If possible, choose a Region with a network round-trip time 
      (RTT) of 35 milliseconds or less.
      • An Amazon VPC that is connected to your external key manager. It must have at least two private
        subnets in two diﬀerent Availability Zones.
        You can use an existing Amazon VPC for your external key store, provided that it fulﬁlls the 
        requirements for use with an external key store. Multiple external key stores can share an 
        Amazon VPC, but each external key store must have its own VPC endpoint service and private 
        DNS name.
      • An Amazon VPC endpoint service powered by AWS PrivateLink with a network load balancer and
        target group.

        The endpoint service cannot require acceptance. Also, you must add AWS KMS as an allowed 
        principal. This allows AWS KMS to create interface endpoints so it can communicate with your 
        external key store proxy.
      • A private DNS name for the VPC endpoint service that is unique in its AWS Region.
        The private DNS name must be a subdomain of a higher-level public domain. For example, if 
        the private DNS name is myproxy-private.xks.example.com, it must be a subdomain of a 
        public domain such as xks.example.com or example.com.
        You must verify ownership of the DNS domain for private DNS name.
      • A TLS certiﬁcate issued by a supported public certiﬁcate authority for your external key store 
        proxy.
        The subject common name (CN) on the TLS certiﬁcate must match the private DNS name. For 
        example, if the private DNS name is myproxy-private.xks.example.com, the CN on the TLS 
        certiﬁcate must be myproxy-private.xks.example.com or *.xks.example.com.
      For all requirements for an external key store, see the Assemble the prerequisites.
      Step 1: Create an Amazon VPC and subnets
      VPC endpoint service connectivity requires an Amazon VPC that is connected to your external 
      key manager with at least two private subnets. You can create an Amazon VPC or use an existing 
      Amazon VPC that fulﬁlls the requirements for external key stores. For help with creating a new 
      Amazon VPC, see Create a VPC in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.
      Requirements for your Amazon VPC
      To work with external key stores using VPC endpoint service connectivity, the Amazon VPC must 
      have the following properties:
      • Must be in the same AWS account and supported Region as your external key store.
      • Requires at least two private subnets, each in a diﬀerent Availability Zone.
      • The private IP address range of your Amazon VPC must not overlap with the private IP address 
        range of the data center hosting your external key manager.
      • All components must use IPv4.

      You have many options for connecting the Amazon VPC to your external key store proxy. Choose an 
      option that meets your performance and security needs. For a list, see Connect your VPC to other 
      networks and Network-to-Amazon VPC connectivity options. For more details, see AWS Direct 
      Connect, and the AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide.
      Creating an Amazon VPC for your external key store
      Use the following instructions to create the Amazon VPC for your external key store. An Amazon 
      VPC is required only if you choose the VPC endpoint service connectivity option. You can use an 
      existing Amazon VPC that fulﬁlls the requirements for an external key store.
      Follow the instructions in the Create a VPC, subnets, and other VPC resources topic using the 
      following required values. For other ﬁelds, accept the default values and provide names as 
      requested.
        Field            Value
        IPv4 CIDR block  Enter the IP addresses for your VPC. The private IP address range of your 
                         Amazon VPC must not overlap with the private IP address range of the data

      Be sure to test your VPC communication. For example, if your external key store proxy is not 
      located in your Amazon VPC, create an Amazon EC2 instance in your Amazon VPC, verify that the 
      Amazon VPC can communicate with your external key store proxy.
      Connecting the VPC to the external key manager
      Connect the VPC to the data center that hosts your external key manager using any of the network 
      connectivity options that Amazon VPC supports. Ensure that the Amazon EC2 instance in the VPC 
      (or the external key store proxy, if it is in the VPC), can communicate with the data center and the 
      external key manager.
      Step 2: Create a target group
      Before you create the required VPC endpoint service, create its required components, a network 
      load balancer (NLB) and a target group. The network load balancer (NLB) distributes requests 
      among multiple healthy targets, any of which can service the request. In this step, you create 
      a target group with at least two hosts for your external key store proxy, and register your IP 
      addresses with the target group.
      Follow the instructions in the Conﬁgure a target group topic using the following required values. 
      For other ﬁelds, accept the default values and provide names as requested.

      Step 4: Create a VPC endpoint service
      Typically, you create an endpoint to a service. However, when you create a VPC endpoint service, 
      you are the provider, and AWS KMS creates an endpoint to your service. For an external key store, 
      create a VPC endpoint service with the network load balancer that you created in the previous step. 
      The VPC endpoint service must must be in the same AWS account and supported Region as your 
      external key store.
      Multiple external key stores can share an Amazon VPC, but each external key store must have its 
      own VPC endpoint service and private DNS name.
      Follow the instructions in the Create an endpoint service topic to create your VPC endpoint service 
      with the following required values. For other ﬁelds, accept the default values and provide names as 
      requested.

                         active. It might take a few minutes for the load balancer state to change from 
                         provisioning to active.

        Field            Value
                         s.example.com     , it must be a subdomain of a public domain such as
                         xks.example.com  or example.com .
                         This private DNS name must match the subject common name (CN) in the 
                         TLS certiﬁcate conﬁgured on your external key store proxy. For example, if 
                         the private DNS name is myproxy-private.xks.example.com        , the 
                         CN on the TLS certiﬁcate must be myproxy-private.xks.example 
                         .com  or *.xks.example.com .
                         If the certiﬁcate and private DNS name do not match, attempts to connect an 
                         external key store to its external key store proxy fail with a connection error 
                         code of XKS_PROXY_INVALID_TLS_CONFIGURATION          . For details, see
                         General conﬁguration errors.
        Supported IP     IPv4
        address types
      Step 5: Verify your private DNS name domain
      When you create your VPC endpoint service, its domain veriﬁcation status is
      pendingVerification. Before using the VPC endpoint service to create an external key store, 
      this status must be verified. To verify that you own the domain associated with your private DNS 
      name, you must create a TXT record in a public DNS server.
      For example, if the private DNS name for your VPC endpoint service is myproxy-
      private.xks.example.com, you must create a TXT record in a public domain, such as
      xks.example.com or example.com, whichever is public. AWS PrivateLink looks for the TXT 
      record ﬁrst on xks.example.com and then on example.com.
           Tip
           After you add a TXT record, it might take a few minutes for the Domain veriﬁcation status
           value to change from pendingVerification to verify.
      Choose a proxy connectivity option                                                      678
      AWS Key Management Service                                                   Developer Guide
      To begin, ﬁnd the veriﬁcation status of your domain using either of the following methods. Valid 
      values are verified, pendingVerification, and failed.
      • In the Amazon VPC console, choose Endpoint services, and choose your endpoint service. In the 
        detail pane, see Domain veriﬁcation status.
      •
        Use the DescribeVpcEndpointServiceConﬁgurations operation. The State value is in the
        ServiceConfigurations.PrivateDnsNameConfiguration.State ﬁeld.
      If the veriﬁcation status is not verified, follow the instructions in the Domain ownership 
      veriﬁcation topic to add a TXT record to your domain's DNS server and verify that the TXT record is 
      published. Then check your veriﬁcation status again.
      You are not required to create an A record for the private DNS domain name. When AWS KMS 
      creates an interface endpoint to your VPC endpoint service, AWS PrivateLink automatically creates 
      a hosted zone with the required A record for the private domain name in the AWS KMS VPC. For 
      external key stores with VPC endpoint service connectivity, this happens when you connect your 
      external key store to its external key store proxy.
      Step 6: Authorize AWS KMS to connect to the VPC endpoint service
      You must add AWS KMS to the Allow principals list for your VPC endpoint service. This 
      allows AWS KMS to create interface endpoints to your VPC endpoint service. If AWS 
      KMS is not an allowed principal, attempts to create an external key store will fail with an
      XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceNotFoundException exception.
      Follow the instructions in the Manage permissions topic in the AWS PrivateLink Guide. Use the 
      following required value.
        Field           Value
        ARN
                        cks.kms.<region>.amazonaws.com

      You can create one or many external key stores in each AWS account and Region. Each external 
      key store must be associated with an external key manager outside of AWS, and an external key 
      store proxy (XKS proxy) that mediates communication between AWS KMS and your external key 
      manager. For details, see Choose an external key store proxy connectivity option. Before you begin,
      conﬁrm that you need an external key store. Most customer can use KMS keys backed by AWS KMS 
      key material.
           Tip
           Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating an external key store. 
           For details, see your external key manager documentation.
      Before you create your external key store, you need to assemble the prerequisites. During the 
      creation process, you specify the properties of your external key store. Most importantly, you 
      indicate whether your external key store in AWS KMS uses a public endpoint or a VPC endpoint 
      service to connect to its external key store proxy. You also specify the connection details, including 
      the URI endpoint of the proxy and the path within that proxy endpoint where AWS KMS sends API 
      requests to the proxy.
      Considerations
      • KMS cannot communicate over IPv6 with External key stores.
      • If you use public endpoint connectivity, make sure that AWS KMS can communicate with your 
        proxy over the internet using an HTTPS connection. This includes conﬁguring TLS on the external 
        key store proxy and ensuring that any ﬁrewalls between AWS KMS and the proxy allow IPv4 
        traﬃc to and from port 443 on the proxy. While creating an external key store with public 
        endpoint connectivity, AWS KMS tests the connection by sending a status request to the external 
        key store proxy. This test veriﬁes that the endpoint is reachable and that your external key store 
        proxy will accept a request signed with your external key store proxy authentication credential. If 
        this test request fails, the operation to create the external key store fails.
      • If you use VPC endpoint service connectivity, make sure that the network load balancer, private 
        DNS name, and VPC endpoint service are conﬁgured correctly and operational. If the external key 
        store proxy isn't in the VPC, you need to ensure that the VPC endpoint service can communicate 
        with the external key store proxy. (AWS KMS tests VPC endpoint service connectivity when you
        connect the external key store to its external key store proxy.)
      Create an external key store                                                            680
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      • AWS KMS records Amazon CloudWatch metrics and dimensions especially for external key 
        stores. Monitoring graphs based on some of these metrics appear in the AWS KMS console for 
        each external key store. We strongly recommend that you use these metrics to create alarms 
        that monitor your external key store. These alarms alert you to early signs of performance and 
        operational problems before they occur. For instructions, see Monitor external key stores.
      • External key stores are subject to resource quotas. Use of KMS keys in an external key store 
        are subject to request quotas. Review these quotas before designing your external key store 
        implementation.
           Note
           Review your conﬁguration for circular dependencies that might prevent it from working.
           For example, if you create your external key store proxy using AWS resources, make sure 
           that operating the proxy does not require the availability of a KMS key in an external key 
           store that is accessed via that proxy.
      All new external key stores are created in a disconnected state. Before you can create KMS 
      keys your external key store, you must connect it to its external key store proxy. To change the 
      properties of your external key store, edit your external key store settings.

      Assemble the prerequisites
      Before you create an external key store, you need to assemble the required components, including 
      the external key manager that you will use to support the external key store and the external key 
      store proxy that translates AWS KMS requests into a format that your external key manager can 
      understand.
      The following components are required for all external key stores. In addition to these 
      components, you need to provide the components to support the external key store proxy 
      connectivity option that you choose.

           Tip
           Your external key manager might include some of these components, or they might be 
           conﬁgured for you. For details, see your external key manager documentation.
           If you are creating your external key store in the AWS KMS console, you have the option to 
           upload a JSON-based proxy conﬁguration ﬁle that speciﬁes the proxy URI path and proxy 
           authentication credential. Some external key store proxies generate this ﬁle for you. For 
           details, see the documentation for your external key store proxy or external key manager.
      External key manager
      Each external key store requires at least one external key manager instance. This can be a physical 
      or virtual hardware security module (HSM), or key management software.
      You can use a single key manager, but we recommend at least two related key manager instances 
      that share cryptographic keys for redundancy. The external key store does not require exclusive 
      use of the external key manager. However, the external key manager must have the capacity to 
      handle the expected frequency of encryption and decryption requests from the AWS services that 
      use KMS keys in the external key store to protect your resources. Your external key manager should 
      be conﬁgured to handle up to 1800 requests per second and to respond within the 250 millisecond 
      timeout for each request. We recommend that you locate the external key manager close to an 
      AWS Region so that the network round-trip time (RTT) is 35 milliseconds or less.
      If your external key store proxy allows it, you can change the external key manager that you 
      associate with your external key store proxy, but the new external key manager must be a backup 
      or snapshot with the same key material. If the external key that you associate with a KMS key 
      is no longer available to your external key store proxy, AWS KMS cannot decrypt the ciphertext 
      encrypted with the KMS key.
      The external key manager must be accessible to the external key store proxy. If the
      GetHealthStatus response from the proxy reports that all external key manager 
      instances are Unavailable, all attempts to create an external key store fail with an
      XksProxyUriUnreachableException.
      External key store proxy
      You must specify an external key store proxy (XKS proxy) that conforms to the design requirements 
      in the AWS KMS External Key Store Proxy API Speciﬁcation. You can develop or buy an external 
      Create an external key store                                                            682
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      key store proxy, or use an external key store proxy provided by or built into your external key 
      manager. AWS KMS recommends that your external key store proxy be conﬁgured to handle up to 
      1800 requests per second and respond within the 250 millisecond timeout for each request. We 
      recommend that you locate the external key manager close to an AWS Region so that the network 
      round-trip time (RTT) is 35 milliseconds or less.
      You can use an external key store proxy for more than one external key store, but each external 
      key store must have a unique URI endpoint and path within the external key store proxy for its 
      requests.
      If you are using VPC endpoint service connectivity, you can locate your external key store proxy in 
      your Amazon VPC, but that is not required. You can locate your proxy outside of AWS, such as in 
      your private data center, and use the VPC endpoint service only to communicate with the proxy.
      Proxy authentication credential
      To create an external key store, you must specify your external key store proxy authentication 
      credential (XksProxyAuthenticationCredential).
      You must establish an authentication credential (XksProxyAuthenticationCredential) for 
      AWS KMS on your external key store proxy. AWS KMS authenticates to your proxy by signing 
      its requests using the Signature Version 4 (SigV4) process with the external key store proxy 
      authentication credential. You specify the authentication credential when you create your external 
      key store and you can change it at any time. If your proxy rotates your credential, be sure to update 
      the credential values for your external key store.
      The proxy authentication credential has two parts. You must provide both parts for your external 
      key store.
      • Access key ID: Identiﬁes the secret access key. You can provide this ID in plain text.
      • Secret access key: The secret part of the credential. AWS KMS encrypts the secret access key in 
        the credential before storing it.
      The SigV4 credential that AWS KMS uses to sign requests to the external key store proxy are 
      unrelated to any SigV4 credentials associated with any AWS Identity and Access Management 
      principals in your AWS accounts. Do not reuse any IAM SigV4 credentials for your external key store 
      proxy.

      Proxy connectivity
      To create an external key store, you must specify your external key store proxy connectivity option 
      (XksProxyConnectivity).
      AWS KMS can communicate with your external key store proxy by using a public endpoint or an
      Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoint service. While a public endpoint is simpler 
      to conﬁgure and maintain, it might not meet the security requirements for every installation. If 
      you choose the Amazon VPC endpoint service connectivity option, you must create and maintain 
      the required components, including an Amazon VPC with at least two subnets in two diﬀerent 
      Availability Zones, a VPC endpoint service with a network load balancer and target group, and a 
      private DNS name for the VPC endpoint service.
      You can change the proxy connectivity option for your external key store. However, you must 
      ensure that the continued availability of the key material associated with the KMS keys in your 
      external key store. Otherwise, AWS KMS cannot decrypt any ciphertext encrypted with those KMS 
      keys.
      For help deciding which proxy connectivity option is best for your external key store, see Choose an 
      external key store proxy connectivity option. For help creating an conﬁguring VPC endpoint service 
      connectivity, see Conﬁgure VPC endpoint service connectivity.
      Proxy URI endpoint
      To create an external key store, you must specify the endpoint (XksProxyUriEndpoint) that AWS 
      KMS uses to send requests to the external key store proxy.
      The protocol must be HTTPS. AWS KMS communicates over IPv4 on port 443. Do not specify the 
      port in the proxy URI endpoint value.
      • Public endpoint connectivity — Specify the publicly available endpoint for your external key 
        store proxy. This endpoint must be reachable before you create your external key store.
      •
        VPC endpoint service connectivity — Specify https:// followed by the private DNS name of 
        the VPC endpoint service.
      The TLS server certiﬁcate conﬁgured on the external key store proxy must match the domain name 
      in the external key store proxy URI endpoint and be issued by a certiﬁcate authority supported 
      for external key stores. For a list, see Trusted Certiﬁcate Authorities. Your certiﬁcate authority will 
      require proof of domain ownership before issuing the TLS certiﬁcate.

      The subject common name (CN) on the TLS certiﬁcate must match the private DNS name. For 
      example, if the private DNS name is myproxy-private.xks.example.com, the CN on the TLS 
      certiﬁcate must be myproxy-private.xks.example.com or *.xks.example.com.
      You can change your proxy URI endpoint, but be sure that the external key store proxy has access 
      to the key material associated with the KMS keys in your external key store. Otherwise, AWS KMS 
      cannot decrypt any ciphertext encrypted with those KMS keys.
      Uniqueness requirements
      •
        The combined proxy URI endpoint (XksProxyUriEndpoint) and proxy URI path 
        (XksProxyUriPath) value must be unique in the AWS account and Region.
      • External key stores with public endpoint connectivity can share the same proxy URI endpoint, 
        provided that they have diﬀerent proxy URI path values.
      • An external key store with public endpoint connectivity cannot use the same proxy URI endpoint 
        value as any external key store with VPC endpoint services connectivity in the same AWS Region, 
        even if the key stores are in diﬀerent AWS accounts.
      • Each external key store with VPC endpoint connectivity must have its own private DNS name. 
        The proxy URI endpoint (private DNS name) must be unique in the AWS account and Region.
      Proxy URI path
      To create an external key store, you must specify the base path in your external key store proxy 
      to the required proxy APIs. The value must start with / and must end with /kms/xks/v1 where v1
      represents the version of the AWS KMS API for the external key store proxy. This path can include 
      an optional preﬁx between the required elements such as /example-prefix/kms/xks/v1. To 
      ﬁnd this value, see the documentation for your external key store proxy.
      AWS KMS sends proxy requests to the address speciﬁed by the concatenation of the proxy 
      URI endpoint and proxy URI path. For example, if the proxy URI endpoint is https://
      myproxy.xks.example.com and the proxy URI path is /kms/xks/v1, AWS KMS sends its proxy 
      API requests to https://myproxy.xks.example.com/kms/xks/v1.
      You can change your proxy URI path, but be sure that the external key store proxy has access to the 
      key material associated with the KMS keys in your external key store. Otherwise, AWS KMS cannot 
      decrypt any ciphertext encrypted with those KMS keys.

        The combined proxy URI endpoint (XksProxyUriEndpoint) and proxy URI path 
        (XksProxyUriPath) value must be unique in the AWS account and Region.
      VPC endpoint service
      Speciﬁes the name of the Amazon VPC endpoint service that is used to communicate with your 
      external key store proxy. This component is required only for external key stores that use VPC 
      endpoint service connectivity. For help setting up and conﬁguring your VPC endpoint service for an 
      external key store, see Conﬁgure VPC endpoint service connectivity.
      The VPC endpoint service must have the following properties:
      • The VPC endpoint service must be in the same AWS account and Region as the external key 
        store.
      • It must have a network load balancer (NLB) connected to at least two subnets, each in a diﬀerent 
        Availability Zone.
      • The allow principals list for the VPC endpoint service must include the AWS KMS service 
        principal for the Region: cks.kms.<region>.amazonaws.com, such as cks.kms.us-
        east-1.amazonaws.com.
      • It must not require acceptance of connection requests.
      • It must have a private DNS name within a higher level public domain. For example, you could 
        have a private DNS name of myproxy-private.xks.example.com in the public xks.example.com
        domain.
        The private DNS name for an external key store with VPC endpoint service connectivity must be 
        unique in its AWS Region.
      •
        The domain veriﬁcation status of the private DNS name domain must be verified.
      • The TLS server certiﬁcate conﬁgured on the external key store proxy must specify the private 
        DNS hostname at which the endpoint is reachable.
      Uniqueness requirements
      •
        External key stores with VPC endpoint connectivity can share an Amazon VPC, but each external

      Proxy conﬁguration ﬁle
      A proxy conﬁguration ﬁle is an optional JSON-based ﬁle that contains values for the proxy URI path
      and proxy authentication credential properties of your external key store. When creating or editing 
      an external key store in the AWS KMS console, you can upload a proxy conﬁguration ﬁle to supply 
      conﬁguration values for your external key store. Using this ﬁle avoids typing and pasting errors, 
      and ensures that the values in your external key store match the values in your external key store 
      proxy.
      Proxy conﬁguration ﬁles are generated by the external key store proxy. To learn whether your 
      external key store proxy oﬀers a proxy conﬁguration ﬁle, see your external key store proxy 
      documentation.
      The following is an example of a well-formed proxy conﬁguration ﬁle with ﬁctitious values.
        { 
          "XksProxyUriPath": "/example-prefix/kms/xks/v1", 
          "XksProxyAuthenticationCredential": { 
            "AccessKeyId": "ABCDE12345670EXAMPLE", 
            "RawSecretAccessKey": "0000EXAMPLEFA5FT0mCc3DrGUe2sti527BitkQ0Zr9MO9+vE=" 
          }
        }
      You can upload a proxy conﬁguration ﬁle only when creating or editing an external key store in the 
      AWS KMS console. You cannot use it with the CreateCustomKeyStore or UpdateCustomKeyStore
      operations, but you can use the values in the proxy conﬁguration ﬁle to ensure that your parameter 
      values are correct.
      Create a new external key store
      Once you've assembled the necessary prerequisites, you can create a new external key store in the 
      AWS KMS console or by using the CreateCustomKeyStore operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      Before creating an external key store, choose your proxy connectivity type and ensure that you 
      have created and conﬁgured all of the required components. If you need help ﬁnding any of the 
      required values, consult the documentation for your external key store proxy or key management 
      software.

           Note
           When you create an external key store in the AWS Management Console, you can upload 
           a JSON-based proxy conﬁguration ﬁle with values for the proxy URI path and proxy 
           authentication credential. Some proxies generate this ﬁle for you. It is not required.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, External key stores.
      4.  Choose Create external key store.
      5.  Enter a friendly name for the external key store. The name must be unique among all external 
          key stores in your account.

               Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
               displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      6.  Choose your proxy connectivity type.
          Your proxy connectivity choice determines the components required for your external key 
          store proxy. For help making this choice, see Choose an external key store proxy connectivity 
          option.
      7.  Choose or enter the name of the VPC endpoint service for this external key store. This step 
          appears only when your external key store proxy connectivity type is VPC endpoint service.
          The VPC endpoint service and its VPCs must fulﬁll the requirements for an external key store. 
          For details, see the section called “Assemble the prerequisites”.
      8.  Enter your proxy URI endpoint. The protocol must be HTTPS. AWS KMS communicates over 
          IPv4 on port 443. Do not specify the port in the proxy URI endpoint value.

              path and proxy authentication credential, choose Upload conﬁguration ﬁle. Follow the 
              steps to upload the ﬁle.
              When the ﬁle is uploaded, the console displays the values from the ﬁle in editable ﬁelds. 
              You can change the values now or edit these values after the external key store is created.
              To display the value of the secret access key, choose Show secret access key.
          •   If you don't have a proxy conﬁguration ﬁle, you can enter the proxy URI path and proxy 
              authentication credential values manually.
              a.  If you don't have a proxy conﬁguration ﬁle, you can enter your proxy URI manually. 
                  The console supplies the required /kms/xks/v1 value.
                  If your proxy URI path includes an optional preﬁx, such as the example-prefix in
                  /example-prefix/kms/xks/v1, enter the preﬁx in the Proxy URI path preﬁx ﬁeld. 
                  Otherwise, leave the ﬁeld empty.
              b.  If you don't have a proxy conﬁguration ﬁle, you can enter your proxy authentication 
                  credential manually. Both the access key ID and secret access key are required.
                  • In Proxy credential: Access key ID, enter the access key ID of the proxy 
                    authentication credential. The access key ID identiﬁes the secret access key.
                  • In Proxy credential: Secret access key, enter the secret access key of the proxy 
                    authentication credential.
                  To display the value of the secret access key, choose Show secret access key.
                  This procedure does not set or change the authentication credential you established 
                  on your external key store proxy. It just associates these values with your external 
                  key store. For information about setting, changing, and your rotating proxy 
                  authentication credential, see the documentation for your external key store proxy or 
                  key management software.
      Create an external key store                                                            689
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
                  If your proxy authentication credential changes, edit the credential setting for your 
                  external key store.
      10. Choose Create external key store.
      When the procedure is successful, the new external key store appears in the list of external key 
      stores in the account and Region. If it is unsuccessful, an error message appears that describes the 
      problem and provides help on how to ﬁx it. If you need more help, see CreateKey errors for the 
      external key.
      Next: New external key stores are not automatically connected. Before you can create AWS KMS 
      keys in your external key store, you must connect the external key store to its external key store 
      proxy.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      You can use the CreateCustomKeyStore operation to create a new external key store. For help 
      ﬁnding the values for the required parameters, see the documentation for your external key store 
      proxy or key management software.
           Tip
           You cannot upload a proxy conﬁguration ﬁle when using the CreateCustomKeyStore
           operation. However, you can use the values in the proxy conﬁguration ﬁle to ensure that 
           your parameter values are correct.
      To create an external key store, the CreateCustomKeyStore operation requires the following 
      parameter values.
      •
        CustomKeyStoreName – A friendly name for the external key store that is unique in the 
        account.
             Important
             Do not include conﬁdential or sensitive information in this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld may be 
             displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
      •
        CustomKeyStoreType — Specify EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE.

      •
        XksProxyConnectivity – Specify PUBLIC_ENDPOINT or VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE.
      •
        XksProxyAuthenticationCredential — Specify both the access key ID and the secret 
        access key.
      •
        XksProxyUriEndpoint — The endpoint that AWS KMS uses to communicate with your 
        external key store proxy.
      •
        XksProxyUriPath — The path within the proxy to the proxy APIs.
      •
        XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName — Required only when your XksProxyConnectivity
        value is VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE.
           Note
           If you use AWS CLI version 1.0, run the following command before specifying a parameter 
           with an HTTP or HTTPS value, such as the XksProxyUriEndpoint parameter.
             aws configure set cli_follow_urlparam false
           Otherwise, AWS CLI version 1.0 replaces the parameter value with the content found at 
           that URI address, causing the following error:
             Error parsing parameter '--xks-proxy-uri-endpoint': Unable to retrieve  
             https:// : received non 200 status code of 404
      The following examples use ﬁctitious values. Before running the command, replace them with valid 
      values for your external key store.
      Create an external key store with public endpoint connectivity.

      Create an external key store with VPC endpoint service connectivity.
        $ aws kms create-custom-key-store 
                --custom-key-store-name ExampleExternalKeyStoreVPC \ 
                --custom-key-store-type EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE \

                --xks-proxy-authentication-credential 
         AccessKeyId=<value>,RawSecretAccessKey=<value>
      When the operation is successful, CreateCustomKeyStore returns the custom key store ID, as 
      shown in the following example response.
        { 
            "CustomKeyStoreId": cks-1234567890abcdef0
        }
      If the operation fails, correct the error indicated by the exception, and try again. For additional 
      help, see Troubleshooting external key stores.
      Next: To use the external key store, connect it to its external key store proxy.
      Edit external key store properties
      You can edit selected properties of an existing external key store.
      You can edit some properties while the external key store is connected or disconnected. For other 
      properties, you must ﬁrst disconnect your external key store from its external key store proxy. 
      The connection state of the external key store must be DISCONNECTED. While your external key 
      store is disconnected, you can manage the key store and its KMS keys, but you cannot create or use 
      KMS keys in the external key store. To ﬁnd the connection state of your external key store, use the
      DescribeCustomKeyStores operation or see the General conﬁguration section on the detail page 
      for the external key store.
      Before updating the properties your external key store, AWS KMS sends a GetHealthStatus request 
      to the external key store proxy using the new values. If the request succeeds, it indicates that you 
      can connect and authenticate to an external key store proxy with the updated property values. If 
      the request fails, the edit operation fails with an exception that identiﬁes the error.
      Edit external key store properties                                                      692
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      When the edit operation completes, the updated property values for your external key store 
      appear in the AWS KMS console and the DescribeCustomKeyStores response. However, it can 
      take up to ﬁve minutes for the changes to be fully eﬀective.
      If you edit your external key store in the AWS KMS console, you have the option to upload a 
      JSON-based proxy conﬁguration ﬁle that speciﬁes the proxy URI path and proxy authentication 
      credential. Some external key store proxies generate this ﬁle for you. For details, see the 
      documentation for your external key store proxy or external key manager.
           Warning
           The updated property values must connect your external key store to a proxy for the same 
           external key manager as the previous values, or for a backup or snapshot of the external 
           key manager with the same cryptographic keys. If your external key store permanently 
           loses its access to the external keys associated with its KMS keys, ciphertext encrypted 
           under those external keys is unrecoverable. In particular, changing the proxy connectivity of 
           an external key store can prevent AWS KMS from accessing your external keys.
           Tip
           Some external key managers provide a simpler method for editing external key store 
           properties. For details, see your external key manager documentation.
      You can change the following properties of an external key store.

       Edit your external key store's properties
       You can edit your external key store's properties in the AWS KMS console or by using the
       UpdateCustomKeyStore operation.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Using the AWS KMS console
      When you edit an key store, you can change any or of the editable values. Some changes require 
      that the external key store be disconnected from its external key store proxy.
      If you are editing the proxy URI path or proxy authentication credential, you can enter the new 
      values or upload an external key store proxy conﬁguration ﬁle that includes the new values.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, External key stores.
      4.  Choose the row of the external key store you want to edit.
      5.  If necessary, disconnect the external key store from its external key store proxy. From the Key 
          store actions menu, choose Disconnect.
      6.  From the Key store actions menu, choose Edit.
      7.  Change one or more of the editable external key store properties. You can also upload an 
          external key store proxy conﬁguration ﬁle with values for the proxy URI path and proxy 
          authentication credential.You can use a proxy conﬁguration ﬁle even if some values speciﬁed 
          in the ﬁle haven't changed.
      8.  Choose Update external key store.
      9.  Review the warning, and if you decide to continue, conﬁrm the warning, and then choose
          Update external key store.
          When the procedure is successful, a message describes the properties that you edited. When 
          it is unsuccessful, an error message appears that describes the problem and provides help on 
          how to ﬁx it.
      10. If necessary, reconnect the external key store. From the Key store actions menu, choose
          Connect.
          You can leave the external key store disconnected. But while it is disconnected, you cannot 
          create KMS keys in the external key store or use the KMS keys in the external key store in
          cryptographic operations.
      Edit external key store properties                                                      695

      Using the AWS KMS API
      To change the properties of an external key store, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation. You 
      can change multiple properties of an external key store in the same operation. If the operation is 
      successful, AWS KMS returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties.
      Use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify the external key store. Use the other 
      parameters to change the properties. You cannot use a proxy conﬁguration ﬁle with the
      UpdateCustomKeyStore operation. The proxy conﬁguration ﬁle is supported only by the AWS 
      KMS console. However, you can use the proxy conﬁguration ﬁle to help you determine the correct 
      parameter values for your external key store proxy.
      The examples in this section use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any 
      supported programming language.
      Before you begin, if necessary, disconnect the external key store from its external key store proxy. 
      After updating, if necessary, you can reconnect the external key store to its external key store 
      proxy. You can leave the external key store in the disconnected state, but you must reconnect it 
      before you can create new KMS keys in the key store or use existing KMS keys in the key store for 
      cryptographic operations.
           Note
           If you use AWS CLI version 1.0, run the following command before specifying a parameter 
           with an HTTP or HTTPS value, such as the XksProxyUriEndpoint parameter.
             aws configure set cli_follow_urlparam false
           Otherwise, AWS CLI version 1.0 replaces the parameter value with the content found at 
           that URI address, causing the following error:
             Error parsing parameter '--xks-proxy-uri-endpoint': Unable to retrieve  
             https:// : received non 200 status code of 404
      Change the name of the external key store
      The ﬁrst example uses the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation to change the friendly name of the 
      external key store to XksKeyStore. The command uses the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to 
      Edit external key store properties                                                      696
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      identify the custom key store and the CustomKeyStoreName to specify the new name for the 
      custom key store. Replace all example values with actual values for your external key store.
        $ aws kms update-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 --new-
        custom-key-store-name XksKeyStore
      Change the proxy authentication credential
      The following example updates the proxy authentication credential that AWS KMS uses to 
      authenticate to the external key store proxy. You can use a command like this one to update the 
      credential if it is rotated on your proxy.
      Update the credential on your external key store proxy ﬁrst. Then use this feature to report the 
      change to AWS KMS. (Your proxy will brieﬂy support both the old and new credential so you have 
      time to update your credential in AWS KMS.)
      You must always specify both the access key ID and the secret access key in the credential, even if 
      only one value is changed.
      The ﬁrst two commands set variables to hold the credential values. The UpdateCustomKeyStore
      operations uses the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify the external key store. It 
      uses the XksProxyAuthenticationCredential parameter with its AccessKeyId and
      RawSecretAccessKey ﬁelds to specify the new credential. Replace all example values with actual 
      values for your external key store.
        $ accessKeyID=access key id
        $ secretAccessKey=secret access key
        $ aws kms update-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 \ 
                --xks-proxy-authentication-credential \  
                    AccessKeyId=$accessKeyId,RawSecretAccessKey=$secretAccessKey
      Change the proxy URI path
      The following example updates the proxy URI path (XksProxyUriPath). The combination of 
      the proxy URI endpoint and the proxy URI path must be unique in the AWS account and Region. 
      Replace all example values with actual values for your external key store.
        $ aws kms update-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 \ 
      Edit external key store properties                                                      697
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
                    --xks-proxy-uri-path /kms/xks/v1
      Change to VPC endpoint service connectivity
      The following example uses the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation to change the external key store 
      proxy connectivity type to VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE. To make this change, you must specify the 
      required values for VPC endpoint service connectivity, including the VPC endpoint service name 
      (XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName) and a proxy URI endpoint (XksProxyUriEndpoint) 
      value that includes the private DNS name for the VPC endpoint service. Replace all example values 
      with actual values for your external key store.
        $ aws kms update-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 \ 
                    --xks-proxy-connectivity "VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE" \ 
                    --xks-proxy-uri-endpoint https://myproxy-private.xks.example.com \ 
                    --xks-proxy-vpc-endpoint-service-name com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-
        svc-example
      Change to public endpoint connectivity
      The following example changes the external key store proxy connectivity type to
      PUBLIC_ENDPOINT. When you make this change, you must update the proxy URI endpoint 
      (XksProxyUriEndpoint) value. Replace all example values with actual values for your external 
      key store.
           Note
           VPC endpoint connectivity provides greater security than public endpoint connectivity. 
           Before changing to public endpoint connectivity, consider other options, including locating 
           your external key store proxy on premises and using the VPC only for communication.
        $ aws kms update-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 \ 
                    --xks-proxy-connectivity "PUBLIC_ENDPOINT" \ 
                    --xks-proxy-uri-endpoint https://myproxy.xks.example.com
      View external key stores
      You can view external key stores in each account and Region by using the AWS KMS console or by 
      using the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
      View external key stores                                                                698
      AWS Key Management Service                                                Developer Guide
      When you view an external key store, you can see the following:
      • Basic information about the key store, including its friendly name, ID, key store type, and 
        creation date.
      • Conﬁguration information for the external key store proxy, including the connectivity type, proxy 
        URI endpoint and path, and the access key ID of your current proxy authentication credential.
      • If the external key store proxy uses VPC endpoint service connectivity, the console displays the 
        name of the VPC endpoint service.
      • The current connection state.
            Note
            A connection state value of Disconnected indicates that the external key store has never 
            been connected, or it was intentionally disconnected from its external key store proxy. 
            However, if your attempts to use a KMS key in a connected external key store fail, that 
            might indicate a problem with the external key store or its proxy. For help, see External 
            key store connection errors.
      • A Monitoring section with graphs of Amazon CloudWatch metrics designed to help you detect 
        and resolve issues with your external key store. For help interpreting the graphs, using them in 
        your planning and troubleshooting, and creating CloudWatch alarms based on the metrics in the 
        graphs, see Monitor external key stores.
      External key store properties
      The following properties of an external key store are visible in the AWS KMS console and the
      DescribeCustomKeyStores response.
      Custom key store properties
      The following values appear in the General conﬁguration section of the detail page for each 
      custom key store.These properties apply to all custom key stores, including AWS CloudHSM key 
      stores and external key stores.
      Custom key store ID
         A unique ID that AWS KMS assigns to the custom key store.

      Custom key store name
         A friendly name that you assign to the custom key store when you create it. You can change this 
         value at any time.
      Custom key store type
         The type of custom key store. Valid values are AWS CloudHSM (AWS_CLOUDHSM) or External key 
         store (EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE). You cannot change the type after you create the custom key 
         store.
      Creation date
         The date that the custom key store was created. This date is displayed in local time for the AWS 
         Region.
      Connection state
         Indicates whether the custom key store is connected to its backing key store. The connection 
         state is DISCONNECTED only if the custom key store has never been connected to its backing 
         key store, or it has been intentionally disconnected. For details, see the section called 
         “Connection state”.
      External key store conﬁguration properties
      The following values appear in the External key store proxy conﬁguration section of the 
      detail page for each external key store and in the XksProxyConfiguration element of the
      DescribeCustomKeyStores response. For a detailed description of each ﬁeld, including uniqueness 
      requirements and help with determining the correct value for each ﬁeld, see the section called 
      “Assemble the prerequisites” in the Creating an external key store topic.
      Proxy connectivity
         Indicates whether the external key store uses public endpoint connectivity or VPC endpoint 
         service connectivity.
      Proxy URI endpoint
         The endpoint that AWS KMS uses to connect to your external key store proxy.
      Proxy URI path
         The path from the proxy URI endpoint where AWS KMS sends proxy API requests.

      Proxy credential: Access key ID
         Part of the proxy authentication credential that you establish on your external key store proxy. 
         The access key ID identiﬁes the secret access key in the credential.
         AWS KMS uses the SigV4 signing process and the proxy authentication credential to sign its 
         requests to your external key store proxy. The credential in the signature allows the external key 
         store proxy to authenticate requests on your behalf from AWS KMS.
      VPC endpoint service name
         The name of the Amazon VPC endpoint service that supports your external key store. This 
         value appears only when the external key store uses VPC endpoint service connectivity. You can 
         locate your external key store proxy in the VPC or use the VPC endpoint service to communicate 
         securely with your external key store proxy.
      View your external key store properties
      You can view your external key store and its associated properties in the AWS KMS console or by 
      using the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      To view the external key stores in a given account and Region, use the following procedure.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, External key stores.
      4.  To view detailed information about an external key store, choose the key store name.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To view your external key stores, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. By default, this 
      operation returns all custom key stores in the account and Region. But you can use either the
      CustomKeyStoreId or CustomKeyStoreName parameter (but not both) to limit the output to a 
      particular custom key store.
      For custom key stores, the output consists of the custom key store ID, name, and type, and the
      connection state of the key store. If the connection state is FAILED, the output also includes

      a ConnectionErrorCode that describes the reason for the error. For help interpreting the
      ConnectionErrorCode for an external key store, see Connection error codes for external key 
      stores.
      For external key stores, the output also includes the XksProxyConfiguration element. This 
      element includes the connectivity type, proxy URI endpoint, proxy URI path, and the access key ID 
      of the proxy authentication credential.
      The examples in this section use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any 
      supported programming language.
      For example, the following command returns all custom key stores in the account and Region. You 
      can use the Limit and Marker parameters to page through the custom key stores in the output.
        $ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores
      The following command uses the CustomKeyStoreName parameter to get only the example 
      external key store with the ExampleXksPublic friendly name. This example key store uses public 
      endpoint connectivity. It is connected to its external key store proxy.
        $ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores --custom-key-store-name ExampleXksPublic
        { 
            "CustomKeyStores": [ 
            { 
              "CustomKeyStoreId": "cks-1234567890abcdef0", 
              "CustomKeyStoreName": "ExampleXksPublic", 
              "ConnectionState": "CONNECTED",     
              "CreationDate": "2022-12-14T20:17:36.419000+00:00", 
              "CustomKeyStoreType": "EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE", 
              "XksProxyConfiguration": {  
                "AccessKeyId": "ABCDE12345670EXAMPLE", 
                "Connectivity": "PUBLIC_ENDPOINT",

              } 
            } 
          ]
        }
      The following command gets an example external key store with VPC endpoint service 
      connectivity. In this example, the external key store is connected to its external key store proxy.

              } 
            } 
          ]
        }
      A ConnectionState of Disconnected indicates that an external key store has never been 
      connected or it was intentionally disconnected from its external key store proxy. However, if 
      attempts to use a KMS key in a connected external key store fail, that might indicate a problem 
      with the external key store proxy or other external components.
      If the ConnectionState of the external key store is FAILED, the DescribeCustomKeyStores
      response includes a ConnectionErrorCode element that explains the reason for the error.
      For example, in the following output, the XKS_PROXY_TIMED_OUT value indicates AWS KMS 
      can connect to the external key store proxy, but the connection failed because the external key 
      store proxy did not respond to AWS KMS in the time allotted. If you see this connection error code 
      repeatedly, notify your external key store proxy vendor. For help with this and other connection 
      error failures, see Troubleshooting external key stores.

      Monitor external key stores
      AWS KMS collects metrics for each interaction with an external key store and publishes them 
      in your CloudWatch account. These metrics are used to generate the graphs in the monitoring 
      section of the detail page for each external key store. The following topic details how to use the 
      graphs to identify and troubleshoot operational and conﬁguration issues impacting your external 
      key store. We recommend using the CloudWatch metrics to set alarms that notify you when your 
      external key store isn't performing as expected. For more information, see Monitoring with Amazon 
      CloudWatch.
      Topics
      • Viewing the graphs
      • Interpreting the graphs
      Viewing the graphs
      You can view the graphs at diﬀerent levels of detail. By default, each graph uses a three hour time 
      range and ﬁve minute aggregation period. You can adjust the graph view within the console, but 
      your changes will revert to the default settings when the external key store detail page is closed or 
      the browser is refreshed. For help with Amazon CloudWatch terminology, see Amazon CloudWatch 
      concepts.
      View data point details
      The data in each graph is collected by AWS KMS metrics. To view more information about a speciﬁc 
      data point, pause the mouse over the data point on the line graph. This will display a pop-up with 
      Monitor external key stores                                                             704

      more information about the metric that the graph was derived from. Each list item displays the
      dimension value recorded at that data point. The pop-up displays a null value (–) if there is no 
      metric data available for the dimension value at that data point. Some graphs record multiple 
      dimensions and values for a single data point. Other graphs, like the reliability graph, use the data 
      collected by the metric to calculate a unique value. Each list item is associated with a diﬀerent line 
      graph color.
      Modify the time range
      To modify the time range, select one of the predeﬁned time ranges in the upper right corner of 
      the monitoring section. The predeﬁned time ranges span from 1 hour to 1 week (1h, 3h, 12h, 1d,
      3d, or 1w). This adjusts the time range for all graphs. If you want to view one speciﬁc graph in a 
      diﬀerent time range, or if you want to set a custom time range, enlarge the graph or view it in the 
      Amazon CloudWatch console.
      Zoom in on graphs
      You can use the mini-map zoom feature to focus on sections of line graphs and stacked portions 
      of the graphs without changing between zoomed-in and zoomed-out views. For example, you can 
      use the mini-map zoom feature to focus on a peak in a graph, so that you can compare the spike 
      against other graphs in the monitoring section from the same timeline.
      1. Choose and drag on the area of the graph that you want to focus on, and then release the drag.
      2. To reset the zoom, choose the Reset zoom icon, which looks like a magnifying glass with a 
         minus (-) symbol inside.
      Enlarge a graph
      To enlarge a graph, select the menu icon in the upper right corner of an individual graph and 
      choose Enlarge. You can also select the enlarge icon that appears next to the menu icon when you 
      hover over a graph.
      Enlarging a graph enables you to further modify the view of a graph by specifying a diﬀerent 
      period, custom time range, or refresh interval. These changes will revert to the default settings 
      when you close the enlarged view.
      Modify the period
         1. Choose the Period options menu. By default, this menu displays the value: 5 minutes.

         2. Choose a period, the predeﬁned periods span from 1 second to 30 days.
            For example, you can choose a one-minute view, which can be useful when troubleshooting. 
            Or, choose a less detailed, one-hour view. That can be useful when viewing a broader time 
            range (for example, 3 days) so that you can see trends over time. For more information, see
            Periods in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
      Modify the time range or time zone
         1.  Select one of the predeﬁned time ranges, which span from 1 hour to 1 week (1h, 3h, 12h,
             1d, 3d, or 1w). Alternatively, you can choose Custom to set your own time range.
         2.  Choose Custom
             a.  Time range: select the Absolute tab in the upper left corner of the box. Use the 
                 calendar picker or text ﬁeld boxes to specify a time range.
             b.  Time zone: choose the dropdown in the upper right corner of the box. You can change 
                 the time zone to UTC or Local time zone.
         3.  After you specify a time range, choose Apply.
      Modify how often the data in your graph is refreshed
         1. Choose the Refresh options menu in the upper-right corner.
         2. Choose a refresh interval (Oﬀ, 10 Seconds, 1 Minute, 2 Minutes, 5 Minutes, or 15 Minutes).
      View graphs in the Amazon CloudWatch console
      The graphs in the monitoring section are derived from predeﬁned metrics that AWS KMS publishes 
      to Amazon CloudWatch. You can open them within the CloudWatch console and save them to 
      CloudWatch dashboards. If you have multiple external key stores, you can open their respective 
      graphs in CloudWatch and save them to a single dashboard to compare their health and usage.
      Add to CloudWatch dashboard
      Select Add to dashboard in the upper right corner to add all of the graphs to an Amazon

      Interpreting the graphs
      AWS KMS provides several graphs to monitor the health of your external key store within the AWS 
      KMS console. These graphs are automatically conﬁgured and derived from AWS KMS metrics.
      The graph data is collected as part of the calls you make to your external key store and external 
      keys. You might see data populating graphs during a time range that you did not make any calls, 
      this data comes from the periodic GetHealthStatus calls that AWS KMS makes on your behalf to 
      check the status of your external key store proxy and external key manager. If your graphs display 
      the message No data available, then there were no calls recorded during that time range or your 
      external key store is in a DISCONNECTED state. You might be able to identify the time your external 
      key store disconnected by adjusting your view to a broader time range.

      Total requests
      The total number of AWS KMS requests being received for a speciﬁc external key store during a 
      given time range. Use this graph to determine if you are at risk of throttling.
      AWS KMS recommends that your external key manager be able to handle up to 1800 requests for 
      cryptographic operations per second. If you approach 540,000 calls in a ﬁve-minute period, you are 
      at risk of throttling.
      You can monitor the number of requests for cryptographic operations on KMS keys in your external 
      key store that AWS KMS throttles with the ExternalKeyStoreThrottle metric.
      If you are getting very frequent KMSInvalidStateException errors with a message that 
      explains that the request was rejected "due to a very high request rate," it might indicate that your 
      Monitor external key stores                                                             707
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      external key manager or external key store proxy cannot keep pace with the current request rate. If 
      possible, lower your request rate. You might also consider requesting a decrease in your custom key 
      store request quota value. Decreasing this quota value might increase throttling, but it indicates 
      that AWS KMS is rejecting excess requests quickly before they are sent to your external key store 
      proxy or external key manager. To request a quota decrease, please visit AWS Support Center and 
      create a case.
      The total requests graph is derived from the XksProxyErrors metric, which collects data on both the 
      successful and unsuccessful responses that AWS KMS receives from your external key store proxy. 
      When you view a speciﬁc data point, the pop-up displays the value of the CustomKeyStoreId
      dimension alongside the total number of AWS KMS requests recorded at that data point. The
      CustomKeyStoreId will always be the same.
      Reliability
      The percentage of AWS KMS requests for which the external key store proxy returned either a 
      successful response or a non-retryable error. Use this graph to evaluate the operational health of 
      your external key store proxy.
      When the graph displays a value less than 100%, it indicates cases where the proxy either did not 
      respond or responded with a retryable error. This can indicate problems with the network, slowness 
      of the external key store proxy or external key manager, or implementation bugs.
      If the request includes a bad credential and your proxy responds with an
      AuthenticationFailedException, the graph will still indicate 100% reliability because the 
      proxy identiﬁed an incorrect value in the external key store proxy API request, and therefore the 
      failure is expected. If the percentage of your reliability graph is 100%, then your external key 
      store proxy is responding as expected. If the graph displays a value less than 100%, then the 
      proxy either responded with a retryable error or timed out. For example, if the proxy responds 
      with a ThrottlingException due to a very high request rate, it will display a lower reliability 
      percentage because the proxy was unable to identify a speciﬁc problem in the request that caused 
      it to fail. This is because retryable errors are likely transient problems that can be resolved by 
      retrying the request.
      The following error responses will lower the reliability percentage. You can use the Top 5 
      exceptions graph and the XksProxyErrors metric to further monitor how frequently your proxy 
      returns each retryable error.

        XksProxyUnreachableException
      The reliability graph is derived from the XksProxyErrors metric, which collects data on both the 
      successful and unsuccessful responses that AWS KMS receives from your external key store proxy. 
      The reliability percentage will only lower if the response has an ErrorType value of Retryable. 
      When you view a speciﬁc data point, the pop-up displays the value of the CustomKeyStoreId
      dimension alongside the reliability percentage for AWS KMS requests recorded at that data point. 
      The CustomKeyStoreId will always be the same.
      We recommend using the XksProxyErrors metric to create a CloudWatch alarm that notiﬁes you of 
      potential networking problems by alerting you when more than ﬁve retryable errors are recorded 
      in a one minute period. For more information, see Create an alarm for retryable errors.
      Latency
      The number of milliseconds it takes for an external key store proxy to respond to an AWS KMS 
      request. Use this graph to evaluate the performance of your external key store proxy and external 
      key manager.
      AWS KMS expects the external key store proxy to respond to each request within 250 milliseconds. 
      In the case of network timeouts, AWS KMS will retry the request once. If the proxy fails a second 
      time, the recorded latency is the combined timeout limit for both request attempts and the graph 
      will display approximately 500 milliseconds. In all other cases where the proxy doesn't respond 
      within the 250 millisecond timeout limit, the recorded latency is 250 milliseconds. If the proxy 
      is frequently timing out on encryption and decryption operations, consult your external proxy 
      administrator. For help troubleshooting latency problems, see Latency and timeout errors.
      Slow responses might also indicate that your external key manager cannot handle the current 
      request traﬃc. AWS KMS recommends that your external key manager be able to handle up to 
      1800 requests for cryptographic operations per second. If your external key manager cannot 
      handle the 1800 requests per second rate, consider requesting a decrease in your request quota for 
      KMS keys in a custom key store. Requests for cryptographic operations using the KMS keys in your 
      external key store will fail fast with a throttling exception, rather than being processed and later 
      rejected by your external key store proxy or external key manager.

      The latency graph is derived from the XksProxyLatency metric. When you view a speciﬁc data 
      point, the pop-up displays the corresponding KmsOperation and XksOperation dimension 
      values alongside the average latency recorded for the operations at that data point. The list items 
      are ordered from highest latency to lowest.
      We recommend using the XksProxyLatency metric to create a CloudWatch alarm that notiﬁes you 
      when your latency is approaching the timeout limit. For more information, see Create an alarm for 
      response timeout.
      Top 5 exceptions
      The top ﬁve exceptions for failed cryptographic and management operations during a given time 
      range. Use this graph to track the most frequent errors, so you can prioritize your engineering 
      eﬀort.
      This count includes exceptions that AWS KMS received from the external key store proxy and the
      XksProxyUnreachableException that AWS KMS returns internally when it cannot establish 
      communication with the external key store proxy.
      High rates of retryable errors might indicate networking errors, while high rates of non-
      retryable errors might indicate a problem with the conﬁguration of your external key store. For 
      example, a spike in AuthenticationFailedExceptions indicates a discrepancy between the 
      authentication credentials conﬁgured in AWS KMS and the external key store proxy. To view your 
      external key store conﬁguration, see View external key stores. To edit your external key store 
      settings, see Edit external key store properties.
      The exceptions that AWS KMS receives from the external key store proxy are diﬀerent from the 
      exceptions that AWS KMS returns when an operation fails. AWS KMS cryptographic operations 
      return an KMSInvalidStateException for all failures related to the external conﬁguration or 
      connection state of the external key store. To identify the problem, use the accompanying error 
      message text.
      The following table shows the exceptions that can appear in the top 5 exceptions graph and the 
      corresponding exceptions that AWS KMS returns to you.

     certiﬁcate.
     The certiﬁcate days to expire graph is derived from the XksProxyCertiﬁcateDaysToExpire metric. 
     We strongly recommend using this metric to create a CloudWatch alarm that notiﬁes you about 
     the upcoming expiration. Certiﬁcate expiration might prevent you from accessing your encrypted 
     resources. Set the alarm to give your organization time to renew the certiﬁcate before it expires. 
     For more information, see Create an alarm for certiﬁcate expiration.
     Connect and disconnect external key stores
     New external key stores are not connected. To create and use AWS KMS keys in your external key 
     store, you need to connect your external key store to its external key store proxy. You can connect 
     and disconnect your external key store at any time, and view its connection state.
     While your external key store is disconnected, AWS KMS cannot communicate with your external 
     key store proxy. As a result, you can view and manage your external key store and its existing 
     KMS keys. However, you cannot create KMS keys in your external key store, or use its KMS keys in 
     cryptographic operations. You might need to disconnect your external key store at some point, 
     such as when editing its properties, but plan accordingly. Disconnecting the key store might disrupt 
     the operation of AWS services that use its KMS keys.
     You are not required to connect your external key store. You can leave an external key store 
     in a disconnected state indeﬁnitely and connect it only when you need to use it. However, you

      might want to test the connection periodically to verify that the settings are correct and it can be 
      connected.
      When you disconnect a custom key store, the KMS keys in the key store become unusable right 
      away (subject to eventual consistency). However, resources encrypted with data keys protected by 
      the KMS key are not aﬀected until the KMS key is used again, such as to decrypt the data key. This 
      issue aﬀects AWS services, many of which use data keys to protect your resources. For details, see
      How unusable KMS keys aﬀect data keys.
          Note
          External key stores are in a DISCONNECTED state only when the key store has never 
          been connected or you explicitly disconnect it. A CONNECTED state does not indicate 
          that external key store or its supporting components are operating eﬃciently. For 
          information about the performance of your external key store components, see the graphs 
          in Monitoring section of the detail page for each external key store. For details, see
          Monitor external key stores.
          Your external key manager might provide additional methods of stopping and restarting 
          communication between your AWS KMS external key store and your external key store 
          proxy, or between your external key store proxy and external key manager. For details, see 
          your external key manager documentation.

      Connection state
      Connecting and disconnecting changes the connection state of your custom key store. Connection 
      state values are the same for AWS CloudHSM key stores and external key stores.
      To view the connection state of your custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation 
      or AWS KMS console. Connection state appears in each custom key store table, in the General 
      conﬁguration section of the detail page for each custom key store, and on the Cryptographic

     conﬁguration tab of KMS keys in a custom key store. For details, see View an AWS CloudHSM key 
     store and View external key stores.
     An custom key store can have one of the following connection states:
     •
       CONNECTED: The custom key store is connected to its backing key store. You can create and use 
       KMS keys in the custom key store.
       The backing key store for an AWS CloudHSM key store is its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. 
       The backing key store for an external key store is external key store proxy and the external key 
       manager that it supports.
       A CONNECTED state means that a connection succeeded and the custom key store has not been 
       intentionally disconnected. It does not indicate that the connection is operating properly. For 
       information about the status of the AWS CloudHSM cluster associated with your AWS CloudHSM 
       key store, see Getting CloudWatch metrics for AWS CloudHSM in the AWS CloudHSM User Guide. 
       For information about the status and operation of your external key store, see the graphs in 
       the Monitoring section of the detail page for each external key store. For details, see Monitor 
       external key stores.
     •
       CONNECTING: The process of connecting an custom key store is in progress. This is a transient 
       state.
     •
       DISCONNECTED: The custom key store has never been connected to its backing, or it was 
       intentionally disconnected by using the AWS KMS console or the DisconnectCustomKeyStore
       operation.
     •
       DISCONNECTING: The process of disconnecting an custom key store is in progress. This is a 
       transient state.
     •
       FAILED: An attempt to connect the custom key store failed. The ConnectionErrorCode in the
       DescribeCustomKeyStores response indicates the problem.
     To connect an custom key store, its connection state must be DISCONNECTED. If the connection 
     state is FAILED, use the ConnectionErrorCode to identify and resolve the problem. Then 
     disconnect the custom key store before trying to connect it again. For help with connection 
     failures, see External key store connection errors. For help responding to a connection error code, 
     see Connection error codes for external key stores.

        In the DescribeCustomKeyStores response, view the value of the ConnectionErrorCode
        element. This element appears in the DescribeCustomKeyStores response only when the
        ConnectionState is FAILED.
      • To view the connection error code in the AWS KMS console, on detail page for the external key 
        store and hover over the Failed value.
      Connect an external key store
      When your external key store is connected to its external key store proxy, you can create KMS keys 
      in your external key store and use its existing KMS keys in cryptographic operations.
      The process that connects an external key store to its external key store proxy diﬀers based on the 
      connectivity of the external key store.
      • When you connect an external key store with public endpoint connectivity, AWS KMS sends a
        GetHealthStatus request to the external key store proxy to validate the proxy URI endpoint,
        proxy URI path, and proxy authentication credential. A successful response from the proxy 
        conﬁrms that the proxy URI endpoint and proxy URI path are accurate and accessible, and that 
        the proxy authenticated the request signed with the proxy authentication credential for the 
        external key store.
      • When you connect an external key store with VPC endpoint service connectivity to its external 
        key store proxy, AWS KMS does the following:
        • Conﬁrms that the domain for the private DNS name speciﬁed in the proxy URI endpoint is
          veriﬁed.
        • Creates an interface endpoint from an AWS KMS VPC to your VPC endpoint service.
        • Creates a private hosted zone for the private DNS name speciﬁed in the proxy URI endpoint

        • Sends a GetHealthStatus request to the external key store proxy. A successful response 
          from the proxy conﬁrms that the proxy URI endpoint and proxy URI path are accurate and 
          accessible, and that the proxy authenticated the request signed with the proxy authentication 
          credential for the external key store.
      The connect operation begins the process of connecting your custom key store, but connecting 
      an external key store it its external proxy takes approximately ﬁve minutes. A success response 
      from the connect operation does not indicate that the external key store is connected. To conﬁrm 
      that the connection was successful, use the AWS KMS console or the DescribeCustomKeyStores
      operation to view the connection state of external your key store.
      When the connection state is FAILED, a connection error code is displayed in the AWS KMS console 
      and is added to the DescribeCustomKeyStore response. For help interpreting connection error 
      codes, see Connection error codes for external key stores.
      Connect and reconnect to your external key store
      You can connect, or reconnect, your external key store in the AWS KMS console or by using the
      ConnectCustomKeyStore operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      You can use the AWS KMS console to connect an external key store to its external key store proxy.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, External key stores.
      4.  Choose the row of the external key store you want to connect.
          If the connection state of the external key store is FAILED, you must disconnect the external 
          key store before you connect it.
      5.  From the Key store actions menu, choose Connect.
      The connection process typically takes about ﬁve minutes to complete.When the operation 
      completes, the connection state changes to CONNECTED.

      If the connection state is Failed, hover over the connection state to see the connection error 
      code, which explains the cause of the error. For help responding to a connection error code, see
      Connection error codes for external key stores. To connect an external key store with a Failed
      connection state, you must ﬁrst disconnect the custom key store.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To connect a disconnected external key store, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation.
      Before connecting, the connection state of the external key store must be DISCONNECTED. If the 
      current connection state is FAILED, disconnect the external key store, and then connect it.
      The connection process takes about ﬁve minutes to complete. Unless it fails quickly,
      ConnectCustomKeyStore returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no 
      properties. However, this initial response does not indicate that the connection was successful. 
      To determine whether the external key store is connected, see the connection state in the
      DescribeCustomKeyStores response.
      The examples in this section use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any 
      supported programming language.
      To identify the external key store, use its custom key store ID. You can ﬁnd the ID on the Custom 
      key stores page in the console or by using the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. Before running 
      this example, replace the example ID with a valid one.
        $ aws kms connect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation does not return the ConnectionState in its response. 
      To verify that the external key store is connected, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. By 
      default, this operation returns all custom keys stores in your account and Region. But you can use 
      either the CustomKeyStoreId or CustomKeyStoreName parameter (but not both) to limit the 
      response to particular custom key stores. A ConnectionState value of CONNECTED indicates that 
      the external key store is connected to its external key store proxy.

      If the ConnectionState value in the DescribeCustomKeyStores response is FAILED, the
      ConnectionErrorCode element indicates the reason for the failure.
      In the following example, the XKS_VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_NOT_FOUND value for 
      the ConnectionErrorCode indicates that AWS KMS can't ﬁnd the VPC endpoint 
      service that it uses to communicate with the external key store proxy. Verify that the
      XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName is correct, the AWS KMS service principal is an allowed 
      principal on the Amazon VPC endpoint service, and that the VPC endpoint service does not require 
      acceptance of connection requests. For help responding to a connection error code, see Connection 
      error codes for external key stores.

      Disconnect an external key store
      When you disconnect an external key store with VPC endpoint service connectivity from its 
      external key store proxy, AWS KMS deletes its interface endpoint to the VPC endpoint service 
      and removes the network infrastructure that it created to support the connection. No equivalent 
      process is required for external key stores with public endpoint connectivity. This action does not 
      aﬀect the VPC endpoint service or any of its supporting components, and it does not aﬀect the 
      external key store proxy or any external components.
      While the external key store is disconnected, AWS KMS does not send any requests to the external 
      key store proxy. The connection state of the external key store is DISCONNECTED. The KMS keys 
      in the disconnected external key store are in an UNAVAILABLE key state (unless they are pending 
      deletion), which means that they cannot be used in cryptographic operations. However, you can 
      still view and manage your external key store and its existing KMS keys.
      The disconnected state is designed to be temporary and reversible. You can reconnect your 
      external key store at any time. Typically, no reconﬁguration is necessary. However, if any properties 
      of the associated external key store proxy have changed while it was disconnected, such as 
      rotation of its proxy authentication credential, you must edit the external key store settings before 
      reconnecting.
           Note
           While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS keys in the custom 
           key store or to use existing KMS keys in cryptographic operations will fail. This action can 
           prevent users from storing and accessing sensitive data.
      To better estimate the eﬀect of disconnecting your external key store, identify the KMS keys in the 
      external key store and determine their past use.
      You might disconnect an external key store for reasons such as the following:
      • To edit its properties. You can edit the custom key store name, proxy URI path, and proxy 
        authentication credential while the external key store is connected. However, to edit the proxy

        connectivity type, proxy URI endpoint, or VPC endpoint service name, you must ﬁrst disconnect 
        the external key store. For details, see Edit external key store properties.
      • To stop all communication between AWS KMS and the external key store proxy. You can also 
        stop communication between AWS KMS and your proxy by disabling your endpoint or VPC 
        endpoint service. In addition, your external key store proxy or key management software might 
        provide additional mechanisms to prevent AWS KMS from communicating with the proxy or to 
        prevent the proxy from accessing your external key manager.
      • To disable all KMS keys in the external key store. You can disable and re-enable KMS keys in an 
        external key store by using the AWS KMS console or the DisableKey operation. These operations 
        complete quickly (subject to eventual consistency), but they act on one KMS key at a time. 
        Disconnecting the external key store changes the key state of all KMS keys in the external key 
        store to Unavailable, which prevents them from being used in any cryptographic operation.
      • To repair a failed connection attempt. If an attempt to connect an external key store fails (the 
        connection state of the custom key store is FAILED), you must disconnect the external key store 
        before you try to connect it again.
      Disconnect your external key store
      You can disconnect your external key store in the AWS KMS console or by using the
      DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      You can use the AWS KMS console to connect an external key store to its external key store proxy. 
      This process takes about 5 minutes to complete.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, External key stores.
      4.  Choose the row of the external key store you want to disconnect.
      5.  From the Key store actions menu, choose Disconnect.
      When the operation completes, the connection state changes from DISCONNECTING to
      DISCONNECTED. If the operation fails, an error message appears that describes the problem and 
      provides help on how to ﬁx it. If you need more help, see External key store connection errors.

      Using the AWS KMS API
      To disconnect a connected external key store, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation. If 
      the operation is successful, AWS KMS returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no

      running this example, replace the example custom key store ID with a valid one.
        $ aws kms disconnect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      To verify that the external key store is disconnected, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. 
      By default, this operation returns all custom keys stores in your account and Region. But you can 
      use either the CustomKeyStoreId and CustomKeyStoreName parameter (but not both) to limit 
      the response to particular custom key stores. The ConnectionState value of DISCONNECTED
      indicates that this example external key store is no longer connected to its external key store proxy.

      from AWS KMS, including information about its external key store proxy. This operation does not 
      aﬀect the external key store proxy, external key manager, external keys, or any AWS resources that 
      you created to support the external key store, such as an Amazon VPC or a VPC endpoint service.
      Before you delete an external key store, you must delete all of the KMS keys from the key store and
      disconnect the key store from its external key store proxy. Otherwise, attempts to delete the key 
      store fail.
      Deleting an external key store is irreversible, but you can create a new external key store and 
      associate it with the same external key store proxy and external key manager. However, you cannot 
      recreate the symmetric encryption KMS keys in the external key store, even you have access to 
      the same external key material. AWS KMS includes metadata in the symmetric ciphertext unique 
      to each KMS key. This security feature ensures that only the KMS key that encrypted the data can 
      decrypt it.
      Instead of deleting the external key store, consider disconnecting it. While an external key store is 
      disconnected, you can manage the external key store and its AWS KMS keys but you cannot create 
      or use KMS keys in the external key store. You can reconnect the external key store at any time and 
      resume using its KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt data. There is no cost for a disconnected external 
      key store proxy or its unavailable KMS keys.
      You can delete your external key store in the AWS KMS console or by using the
      DeleteCustomKeyStore operation.
      Using the AWS KMS console
      You can use the AWS KMS console to delete an external key store.
      1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
          KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.
      2.  To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.
      3.  In the navigation pane, choose Custom key stores, External key stores.
      4.  Find the row that represents the external key store that you want to delete. If the Connection 
          state of the external key store is not DISCONNECTED, you must disconnect the external key 
          store before you delete it.
      5.  From the Key store actions menu, choose Delete.
      Delete an external key store                                                            727

      When the operation completes, a success message appears and the external key store no 
      longer appears in the key store list. If the operation is unsuccessful, an error message appears 
      that describes the problem and provides help on how to ﬁx it. If you need more help, see
      Troubleshooting external key stores.
      Using the AWS KMS API
      To delete an external key store, use the DeleteCustomKeyStore operation. If the operation is 
      successful, AWS KMS returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties.
      To begin, disconnect the external key store. Before running this command, replace the example 
      custom key store ID with a valid one.
        $ aws kms disconnect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      After the external key store is disconnected, you can use the DeleteCustomKeyStore operation to 
      delete it.
        $ aws kms delete-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
      To conﬁrm that the external key store is deleted, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
        $ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores
                    
        { 
            "CustomKeyStores": []
        }
      If you specify a custom key store name or ID that no longer exists, AWS KMS returns a
      CustomKeyStoreNotFoundException exception.
        $ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
        An error occurred (CustomKeyStoreNotFoundException) when calling the 
         DescribeCustomKeyStore operation: 
      Troubleshooting external key stores
      The resolution for most problems with external key stores are indicated by the error message that 
      AWS KMS displays with each exception, or by the connection error code that AWS KMS returns 
      Troubleshooting external key stores                                                     728

      when an attempt to connect the external key store to its external key store proxy fails. However, 
      some issues are a bit more complex.
      When diagnosing an issue with an external key store, ﬁrst locate the cause. This will narrow the 
      range of remedies and make your troubleshooting more eﬃcient.
      • AWS KMS — The problem might be within AWS KMS, such as an incorrect value in your external 
        key store conﬁguration.
      • External — The problem might originate outside of AWS KMS, including problems with the 
        conﬁguration or operation of the external key store proxy, external key manager, external keys, 
        or VPC endpoint service.
      • Networking — It might be a problem with connectivity or networking, such as a problem with 
        your proxy endpoint, port, IP stack, or your private DNS name or domain.
           Note
           When management operations on external key stores fail, they generate several diﬀerent 
           exceptions. But AWS KMS cryptographic operations return KMSInvalidStateException
           for all failures related to the external conﬁguration or connection state of the external key 
           store. To identify the problem, use the accompanying error message text.
           The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation succeeds quickly before the connection process is 
           complete. To determine whether the connection process is successful, view the connection 
           state of the external key store. If the connection process fails, AWS KMS returns a
           connection error code that explains the cause and suggests a remedy.

      Troubleshooting tools for external key stores
      AWS KMS provides several tools to help you identify and resolve problems with your external key 
      store and its keys. Use these tools in conjunction with the tools provided with your external key 
      store proxy and external key manager.
           Note
           Your external key store proxy and external key manager might provide easier methods 
           of creating and maintaining your external key store and its KMS keys. For details, see the 
           documentation for your external tools.
      AWS KMS exceptions and error messages
         AWS KMS provides a detailed error message about any problem it encounters. You can ﬁnd 
         additional information about AWS KMS exceptions in the AWS Key Management Service API 
         Reference and AWS SDKs. Even if you are using the AWS KMS console, you might ﬁnd these 
         references to be helpful. For example, see the Errors list for the CreateCustomKeyStores
         operation.
         To optimize the performance of your external key store proxy, AWS KMS returns exceptions 
         based on your proxy's reliability within a given aggregation period of 5 minutes. In the 
         event of a 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable, or connection timeout, a 
         proxy with high reliability returns KMSInternalException and triggers an automatic retry 
         to ensure that requests eventually succeed. However, a proxy with low reliability returns
         KMSInvalidStateException. For more information, see Monitoring an external key store.
         If the problem surfaces in a diﬀerent AWS service, such as when you use a KMS key in your 
         external key store to protect a resource in another AWS service, the AWS service might provide 
         additional information to help you identify the problem. If the AWS service doesn't provide the 
         message, you can view the error message in the CloudTrail logs that record the use of your KMS 
         key.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
      CloudTrail logs
         Every AWS KMS API operation, including actions in the AWS KMS console, is recorded in AWS 
         CloudTrail logs. AWS KMS records a log entry for successful and failed operations. For failed 
         operations, the log entry includes the AWS KMS exception name (errorCode) and the error 
         message (errorMessage). You can use this information to help you identify and resolve the 
         error. For an example, see Decrypt failure with a KMS key in an external key store.
         The log entry also includes the request ID. If the request reached your external key store proxy, 
         you can use the request ID in the log entry to ﬁnd the corresponding request in your proxy logs, 
         if your proxy provides them.
      CloudWatch metrics
         AWS KMS records detailed Amazon CloudWatch metrics about the operation and performance 
         of your external key store, including latency, throttling, proxy errors, external key manager 
         status, the number of days until your TLS certiﬁcate expires, and the reported age of your proxy 
         authentication credentials. You can use these metrics to develop data models for the operation 
         of your external key store and CloudWatch alarms that alert you to impending problems before 
         they occur.
              Important
              AWS KMS recommends that you create CloudWatch alarms to monitor the external 
              key store metrics. These alarms will alert you to early signs of problems before they 
              develop.
      Monitoring graphs
         AWS KMS displays graphs of the external key store CloudWatch metrics on the detail page for 
         each external key store in the AWS KMS console. You can use the data in the graphs to help 
         locate the source of errors, detect impending problems, establish baselines, and reﬁne your 
         CloudWatch alarm thresholds. For details about interpreting the monitoring graphs and using 
         their data, see Monitor external key stores.
      Displays of external key stores and KMS keys
         AWS KMS displays detailed information about your external key stores and the KMS 
         keys in the external key store in the AWS KMS console, and in the response to the
         DescribeCustomKeyStores and DescribeKey operations. These displays include special ﬁelds

      AWS Key Management Service                                                    Developer Guide
         for external key stores and KMS keys with information that you can use for troubleshooting, 
         such as the connection state of the external key store and the ID of the external key that is 
         associated with the KMS key. For details, see View external key stores.
      XKS Proxy Test Client
         AWS KMS provides an open source test client that veriﬁes that your external key store proxy 
         conforms to the AWS KMS External Key Store Proxy API Speciﬁcation. You can use this test 
         client to identify and resolve problems with your external key store proxy.
      Conﬁguration errors
      When you create an external key store, you specify property values that comprise the conﬁguration
      of your external key store, such as the proxy authentication credential, proxy URI endpoint, proxy 
      URI path, and VPC endpoint service name. When AWS KMS detects an error in a property value, the 
      operation fails and returns an error that indicates the faulty value.
      Many conﬁguration issues can be resolved by ﬁxing the incorrect value. You can ﬁx an invalid proxy 
      URI path or proxy authentication credential without disconnecting the external key store. For 
      deﬁnitions of these values, including uniqueness requirements, see Assemble the prerequisites. For 
      instructions about updating these values, see Edit external key store properties.
      To avoid errors with your proxy URI path and proxy authentication credential values, when creating 
      or updating your external key store, upload a proxy conﬁguration ﬁle to the AWS KMS console. 
      This is a JSON-based ﬁle with proxy URI path and proxy authentication credential values that 
      is provided by your external key store proxy or external key manager. You can't use a proxy 
      conﬁguration ﬁle with AWS KMS API operations, but you can use the values in the ﬁle to help you 
      provide parameter values for your API requests that match the values in your proxy.
      General conﬁguration errors
      Exceptions: CustomKeyStoreInvalidStateException (CreateKey),
      KMSInvalidStateException (cryptographic operations),
      XksProxyInvalidConfigurationException (management operations, except for CreateKey)
      Connection error codes: XKS_PROXY_INVALID_CONFIGURATION,
      XKS_PROXY_INVALID_TLS_CONFIGURATION
      For external key stores with public endpoint connectivity, AWS KMS tests the property values when 
      you create and update the external key store. For external key stores with VPC endpoint service

      connectivity, AWS KMS tests the property values when you connect and update the external key 
      store.
           Note
           The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation, which is asynchronous, might succeed even 
           though the attempt to connect the external key store to its external key store proxy fails. In 
           that case, there is no exception, but the connection state of the external key store is Failed, 
           and a connection error code explains the error message. For more information, see External 
           key store connection errors.
      If AWS KMS detects an error in a property value, the operation fails and returns
      XksProxyInvalidConfigurationException with one of the following error messages.
        The external key store proxy rejected the request because of an invalid URI path. Verify the URI 
        path for your external key store and update if necessary.
      • The proxy URI path is the base path for AWS KMS requests to the proxy APIs. If this path is 
        incorrect, all requests to the proxy fail. To view the current proxy URI path for your external key 
        store, use the AWS KMS console or the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. To ﬁnd the 
        correct proxy URI path, see your external key store proxy documentation. For help correcting 
        your proxy URI path value, see Edit external key store properties.
      • The proxy URI path for your external key store proxy can change with updates to your external 
        key store proxy or external key manager. For information about these changes, see the 
        documentation for your external key store proxy or external key manager.
        XKS_PROXY_INVALID_TLS_CONFIGURATION
        AWS KMS cannot establish a TLS connection to the external key store proxy. Verify the TLS 
        conﬁguration, including its certiﬁcate.
      • All external key store proxies require a TLS certiﬁcate. The TLS certiﬁcate must be issued 
        by a public certiﬁcate authority (CA) that is supported for external key stores. For list of 
      Troubleshooting external key stores                                                     733
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
        supported CAs, see Trusted Certiﬁcate Authorities in the AWS KMS External Key Store Proxy API 
        Speciﬁcation.
      • For public endpoint connectivity, the subject common name (CN) on the TLS certiﬁcate must 
        match the domain name in the proxy URI endpoint for the external key store proxy. For example, 
        if the public endpoint is https://myproxy.xks.example.com, the TLS, the CN on the TLS certiﬁcate 
        must be myproxy.xks.example.com or *.xks.example.com.
      • For VPC endpoint service connectivity, the subject common name (CN) on the TLS certiﬁcate 
        must match the private DNS name for your VPC endpoint service. For example, if the private 
        DNS name is myproxy-private.xks.example.com, the CN on the TLS certiﬁcate must be myproxy-
        private.xks.example.com or *.xks.example.com.
      • The TLS certiﬁcate cannot be expired. To get the expiration date of a TLS certiﬁcate, use SSL 
        tools, such as OpenSSL. To monitor the expiration date of a TLS certiﬁcate associated with an 
        external key store, use the XksProxyCertiﬁcateDaysToExpire CloudWatch metric. The number of 
        days to your TLS certiﬁcation expiration date also appears in the Monitoring section of the AWS 
        KMS console.
      • If you are using public endpoint connectivity, use SSL test tools to test your SSL conﬁguration. 
        TLS connection errors can result from incorrect certiﬁcate chaining.
      VPC endpoint service connectivity conﬁguration errors
      Exceptions: XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceNotFoundException,
      XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceInvalidConfigurationException
      In addition to general connectivity issues, you might encounter the following issues while creating, 
      connecting, or updating an external key store with VPC endpoint service connectivity. AWS KMS 
      tests the property values of an external key store with VPC endpoint service connectivity while
      creating, connecting, and updating the external key store. When management operations fail due 
      to conﬁguration errors, they generate the following exceptions:
        XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceNotFoundException
      The cause might be one of the following:
      • An incorrect VPC endpoint service name. Verify that the VPC endpoint service name 
        for the external key store is correct and matches the proxy URI endpoint value for the 
        external key store. To ﬁnd the VPC endpoint service name, use the Amazon VPC console
      Troubleshooting external key stores                                                   734
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
        or the DescribeVpcEndpointServices operation. To ﬁnd the VPC endpoint service name 
        and proxy URI endpoint of an existing external key store, use the AWS KMS console or the
        DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. For details, see View external key stores.
      • The VPC endpoint service might be in a diﬀerent AWS Region than the external key store. 
        Verify that the VPC endpoint service and external key store are in same Region. (The external 
        name of the Region name, such as us-east-1, is part of the VPC endpoint service name, such 
        as com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-example.) For a list of requirements for the VPC 
        endpoint service for an external key store, see VPC endpoint service. You cannot move a VPC 
        endpoint service or an external key store to a diﬀerent Region. However, you can create a new 
        external key store in the same Region as the VPC endpoint service. For details, see Conﬁgure VPC 
        endpoint service connectivity and Create an external key store.
      • AWS KMS is not an allowed principal for the VPC endpoint service. The Allow principals list for 
        the VPC endpoint service must include the cks.kms.<region>.amazonaws.com value, such as
        cks.kms.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com. For instructions about adding this value, see Manage 
        permissions in the AWS PrivateLink Guide.
        XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceInvalidConﬁgurationException
      This error occurs when the VPC endpoint service fails to meet one of the following requirements:
      • The VPC requires at least two private subnets, each in a diﬀerent Availability Zone. For help 
        adding a subnet to your VPC, see Create a subnet in your VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
      • Your VPC endpoint service type must use a network load balancer, not a gateway load balancer.
      • Acceptance must not be required for the VPC endpoint service (Acceptance required must be 
        false.). If manual acceptance of each connection request is required, AWS KMS cannot use the 
        VPC endpoint service to connect to the external key store proxy. For details, see Accept or reject 
        connection requests in the AWS PrivateLink Guide.
      • The VPC endpoint service must have a private DNS name that is a subdomain of a public domain. 
        For example, if the private DNS name is https://myproxy-private.xks.example.com, the
        xks.example.com or example.com domains must have a public DNS server. To view or change 
        the private DNS name for your VPC endpoint service, see Manage DNS names for VPC endpoint 
        services in the AWS PrivateLink Guide.
      •
        The Domain veriﬁcation status of the domain for your private DNS name must be verified.

        to appear after you've added the required text record.
            Note
            A private DNS domain can be veriﬁed only if it is the subdomain of a public domain. 
            Otherwise, the veriﬁcation status of the private DNS domain does not change, even after 
            you add the required TXT record.
      • Ensure that any ﬁrewalls between AWS KMS and the external key store proxy allow traﬃc to and 
        from port 443 on the proxy. AWS KMS communicates on port 443 over IPv4. This value is not 
        conﬁgurable.
      • The private DNS name of the VPC endpoint service must match the proxy URI endpoint value 
        for the external key store. For an external key store with VPC endpoint service connectivity, the 
        proxy URI endpoint must be https:// followed by the private DNS name of the VPC endpoint 
        service. To view the proxy URI endpoint value, see View external key stores. To change the proxy 
        URI endpoint value, see Edit external key store properties.
      External key store connection errors
      The process of connecting an external key store to its external key store proxy takes about ﬁve 
      minutes to complete. Unless it fails quickly, the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation returns 
      an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this initial response does 
      not indicate that the connection was successful. To determine whether the external key store is 
      connected, see its connection state. If the connection fails, the connection state of the external key 
      store changes to FAILED and AWS KMS returns a connection error code that explains the cause of 
      the failure.
           Note
           When the connection state of a custom key store is FAILED, you must disconnect the 
           custom key store before attempting to reconnect it. You cannot connect a custom key store 
           with a FAILED connection status.

      INTERNAL_ERROR
         AWS KMS could not complete the request due to an internal error. Retry the request. For
         ConnectCustomKeyStore requests, disconnect the custom key store before trying to connect 
         again.
      INVALID_CREDENTIALS
         One or both of the XksProxyAuthenticationCredential values is not valid on the 
         speciﬁed external key store proxy.

      NETWORK_ERRORS
         Network errors are preventing AWS KMS from connecting the custom key store to its backing 
         key store.
      XKS_PROXY_ACCESS_DENIED
         AWS KMS requests are denied access to the external key store proxy. If the external key store 
         proxy has authorization rules, verify that they permit AWS KMS to communicate with the proxy 
         on your behalf.
      XKS_PROXY_INVALID_CONFIGURATION
         A conﬁguration error is preventing the external key store from connecting to its proxy. Verify 
         the value of the XksProxyUriPath.
      XKS_PROXY_INVALID_RESPONSE
         AWS KMS cannot interpret the response from the external key store proxy. If you see this 
         connection error code repeatedly, notify your external key store proxy vendor.
      XKS_PROXY_INVALID_TLS_CONFIGURATION
         AWS KMS cannot connect to the external key store proxy because the TLS conﬁguration is 
         invalid. Verify that the external key store proxy supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3. Also, verify that the 
         TLS certiﬁcate is not expired, that it matches the hostname in the XksProxyUriEndpoint
         value, and that it is signed by a trusted certiﬁcate authority included in the Trusted Certiﬁcate 
         Authorities list.
      XKS_PROXY_NOT_REACHABLE
         AWS KMS can't communicate with your external key store proxy. Verify that the
         XksProxyUriEndpoint and XksProxyUriPath are correct. Use the tools for your external 
         key store proxy to verify that the proxy is active and available on its network. Also, verify that 
         your external key manager instances are operating properly. Connection attempts fail with 
         this connection error code if the proxy reports that all external key manager instances are 
         unavailable.
      XKS_PROXY_TIMED_OUT
         AWS KMS can connect to the external key store proxy, but the proxy does not respond to AWS 
         KMS in the time allotted. If you see this connection error code repeatedly, notify your external 
         key store proxy vendor.

      XKS_VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_INVALID_CONFIGURATION
         The Amazon VPC endpoint service conﬁguration doesn't conform to the requirements for an 
         AWS KMS external key store.
         • The VPC endpoint service must be an endpoint service for interface endpoints in the caller's 
           AWS account.
         • It must have a network load balancer (NLB) connected to at least two subnets, each in a 
           diﬀerent Availability Zone.
         •
           The Allow principals list must include the AWS KMS service principal for the Region,
           cks.kms.<region>.amazonaws.com, such as cks.kms.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.
         • It must not require acceptance of connection requests.
         • It must have a private DNS name. The private DNS name for an external key store with
           VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE connectivity must be unique in its AWS Region.
         •
           The domain of the private DNS name must have a veriﬁcation status of verified.
         • The TLS certiﬁcate speciﬁes the private DNS hostname at which the endpoint is reachable.
      XKS_VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_NOT_FOUND
         AWS KMS can't ﬁnd the VPC endpoint service that it uses to communicate with the external key 
         store proxy. Verify that the XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName is correct and the AWS KMS 
         service principal has service consumer permissions on the Amazon VPC endpoint service.
      Latency and timeout errors
      Exceptions: CustomKeyStoreInvalidStateException (CreateKey),
      KMSInvalidStateException (cryptographic operations),
      XksProxyUriUnreachableException (management operations)
      Connection error codes: XKS_PROXY_NOT_REACHABLE, XKS_PROXY_TIMED_OUT
      When AWS KMS can't contact the proxy within the 250 millisecond timeout interval, it 
      returns an exception. CreateCustomKeyStore and UpdateCustomKeyStore return
      XksProxyUriUnreachableException. Cryptographic operations return the standard
      KMSInvalidStateException with an error message that describes the problem. If
      ConnectCustomKeyStore fails, AWS KMS returns a connection error code that describes the 
      problem.

      Timeout errors might be transient issues that can be resolved by retrying the request. If the 
      problem persists, verify that your external key store proxy is active and is connected to the 
      network, and that its proxy URI endpoint, proxy URI path, and VPC endpoint service name (if any) 
      are correct in your external key store. Also, verify that your external key manager is close to the 
      AWS Region for your external key store. If you need to update any of these values, see Edit external 
      key store properties.
      To track latency patterns, use the XksProxyLatency CloudWatch metric and the Average latency
      graph (based on that metric) in the Monitoring section of the AWS KMS console. Your external key 
      store proxy might also generate logs and metrics that track latency and timeouts.
       XksProxyUriUnreachableException
       AWS KMS cannot communicate with the external key store proxy. This might be a transient 
        network issue. If you see this error repeatedly, verify that your external key store proxy is active 
       and is connected to the network, and that its endpoint URI is correct in your external key store.
      • The external key store proxy didn't respond to an AWS KMS proxy API request within the 250 
       millisecond timeout interval. This might indicate a transient network problem or an operational 
       or performance problem with the proxy. If retrying doesn't solve the problem, notify your 
       external key store proxy administrator.
      Latency and timeout errors often manifest as connection failures. When the
      ConnectCustomKeyStore operation fails, the connection state of the external key store changes 
      to FAILED and AWS KMS returns a connection error code that explains the error. For a list of 
      connection error codes and suggestions for resolving the errors, see Connection error codes for 
      external key stores. The connection codes lists for All custom key stores and External key stores
      apply to external key stores. The following connection errors are related to latency and timeouts.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
        AWS KMS cannot communicate with the external key store proxy. Verify that your external key 
        store proxy is active and is connected to the network, and that its URI path and endpoint URI or 
        VPC service name are correct in your external key store.
      This error might occur for the following reasons:
      • The external key store proxy is not active and or not connected to the network.
      • There is an error in the proxy URI endpoint, proxy URI path, or VPC endpoint service name
        (if applicable) values in the external key store conﬁguration. To view the external key store 
        conﬁguration, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation or view the detail page for the 
        external key store in the AWS KMS console.
      • There might be a network conﬁguration error, such as a port error, on the network path between 
        AWS KMS and the external key store proxy. AWS KMS communicates with the external key store 
        proxy on port 443 over IPv4. This value is not conﬁgurable.
      • When the external key store proxy reports (in a GetHealthStatus response) that all external 
        key manager instances are UNAVAILABLE, the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation fails with 
        a ConnectionErrorCode of XKS_PROXY_NOT_REACHABLE. For help, see your external key 
        manager documentation.
      • This error can result from a long physical distance between the external key manager and the 
        AWS Region with the external key store. The ping latency (network round-trip time (RTT)) 
        between the AWS Region and the external key manager should be no more than 35 milliseconds. 
        You might have to create an external key store in an AWS Region that is closer to the external 
        key manager, or move the external key manager to a data center that is closer to the AWS 
        Region.

      • This error can result from a long physical distance between the external key manager and the 
        external key store proxy. If possible, move the external key store proxy closer to the external key 
        manager.
      • Timeout errors can occur when the proxy is not designed to handle the volume and frequency of 
        requests from AWS KMS. If your CloudWatch metrics indicate a persistent problem, notify your 
        external key store proxy administrator.
      • Timeout errors can occur when the connection between the external key manager and the 
        Amazon VPC for the external key store is not operating properly. If you are using AWS Direct 
        Connect, verify that your VPC and external key manager can communicate eﬀectively. For help 
        resolving any issues, see Troubleshooting AWS Direct Connect in the AWS Direct Connect User 
        Guide.

        Cryptographic operations return KMSInvalidStateException for all external conﬁguration 
        errors and connection state errors in an external key store. The accompanying error message 
        describes the problem.
       The external key store proxy rejected the request because it could not authenticate AWS KMS. 
       Verify the credentials for your external key store and update if necessary.
      This error might occur for the following reasons:
      • The access key ID or the secret access key for the external key store doesn't match the values 
        established on the external key store proxy.
        To ﬁx this error, update the proxy authentication credential for your external key store. You can 
        make this change without disconnecting your external key store.
      • A reverse proxy between AWS KMS and the external key store proxy could be manipulating HTTP 
        headers in a manner that invalidates the SigV4 signatures. To ﬁx this error, notify your proxy 
        administrator.

      •
        When a management operation, such as CancelKeyDeletion, fails and returns this exception, 
        it indicates that the key state of the KMS key is not compatible with the operation.
      • When a cryptographic operation on a KMS key in a custom key store fails with

        But AWS KMS cryptographic operation return KMSInvalidStateException for all external 
        conﬁguration errors and connection state errors in an external key store. To identify the problem, 
        use the error message that accompanies the exception.
      To ﬁnd the required key state for an AWS KMS API operations, see Key states of AWS KMS keys. To 
      ﬁnd the key state of a KMS key, on the Customer managed keys page, view the Status ﬁeld of the 
      KMS key. Or, use the DescribeKey operation and view the KeyState element in the response. For 
      details, see Identify and view keys.
           Note
           The key state of a KMS key in an external key store does not indicate anything about the 
           status of its associated external key. For information about the external key status, use your 
           external key manager and external key store proxy tools.
           The CustomKeyStoreInvalidStateException refers to the connection state of the 
           external key store, not the key state of a KMS key.
      A cryptographic operation on a KMS key in a custom store might fail because the key state of the 
      KMS key is Unavailable or PendingDeletion. (Disabled keys return DisabledException.)
      •
        A KMS key has a Disabled key state only when you intentionally disable the KMS key in the 
        AWS KMS console or by using the DisableKey operation. While a KMS key is disabled, you can 
        view and manage the key, but you cannot use it in cryptographic operations. To ﬁx this problem, 
        enable the key. For details, see Enable and disable keys.
      •
        A KMS key has an Unavailable key state when the external key store is disconnected from its 
        external key store proxy. To ﬁx an unavailable KMS key, reconnect the external key store. After 
        the external key store is reconnected, the key state of the KMS keys in the external key store is 
        automatically restored to its previous state, such as Enabled or Disabled.
        A KMS key has a PendingDeletion key state when it has been scheduled for deletion and is 
        in its waiting period. A key state error on a KMS key that is pending deletion indicates that the 
        key should not be deleted, either because it's being used for encryption, or it is required for

      Decryption errors
      Exceptions: KMSInvalidStateException
      When a Decrypt operation with a KMS key in an external key store fails, AWS KMS returns the 
      standard KMSInvalidStateException that cryptographic operations use for all external 
      conﬁguration errors and connection state errors on an external key store. The error message 
      indicates the problem.
      To decrypt a ciphertext that was encrypted using double encryption, the external key manager 
      ﬁrst uses the external key to decrypt the outer layer of ciphertext. Then AWS KMS uses the AWS 
      KMS key material in the KMS key to decrypt the inner layer of ciphertext. An invalid or corrupt 
      ciphertext can be rejected by the external key manager or AWS KMS.
      The following error messages accompany the KMSInvalidStateException when decryption 
      fails. It indicates a problem with the ciphertext or the optional encryption context in the request.
        The external key store proxy rejected the request because the speciﬁed ciphertext or additional 
        authenticated data is corrupted, missing, or otherwise invalid.
      • When the external key store proxy or external key manager report that a ciphertext or its 
        encryption context is invalid, it typically indicates a problem with the ciphertext or encryption 
        context in the Decrypt request sent to AWS KMS. For Decrypt operations, AWS KMS sends the 
        proxy the same ciphertext and encryption context it receives in the Decrypt request.
        This error might be caused by a networking problem in transit, such as a ﬂipped bit. Retry the
        Decrypt request. If the problem persists, verify that the ciphertext was not altered or corrupted. 
        Also, verify that the encryption context in the Decrypt request to AWS KMS matches the 
        encryption context in the request that encrypted the data.
        The ciphertext that the external key store proxy submitted for decryption, or the encryption 
        context, is corrupted, missing, or otherwise invalid.

      • When AWS KMS rejects the ciphertext that it received from the proxy, it indicates that the 
        external key manager or proxy returned an invalid or corrupt ciphertext to AWS KMS.
        This error might be caused by a networking problem in transit, such as a ﬂipped bit. Retry the
        Decrypt request. If the problem persists, verify that the external key manager is operating 
        properly, and that the external key store proxy does not alter the ciphertext that it receives from 
        the external key manager before it returns it to AWS KMS.
      External key errors
      An external key is a cryptographic key in the external key manager that serves as the external key 
      material for a KMS key. AWS KMS cannot directly access the external key. It must ask the external 
      key manager (via the external key store proxy) to use the external key to encrypt data or decrypt a 
      ciphertext.
      You specify the ID of the external key in its external key manager when you create a KMS key 
      in your external key store. You cannot change the external key ID after the KMS key is created. 
      To prevent problems with the KMS key, the CreateKey operation asks the external key store 
      proxy to verify the ID and conﬁguration of the external key. If the external key doesn't fulﬁll the 
      requirements for use with a KMS key, the CreateKey operation fails with an exception and error 
      message that identiﬁes the problem.
      However, issues can occur after the KMS key is created. If a cryptographic operation fails because of 
      a problem with the external key, the operation fails and returns an KMSInvalidStateException
      with an error message that indicates the problem.
      CreateKey errors for the external key
      Exceptions: XksKeyAlreadyInUseException, XksKeyNotFoundException,
      XksKeyInvalidConfigurationException
      The CreateKey operation attempts to verify the ID and properties of the external key that you 
      provide in the External key ID (console) or XksKeyId (API) parameter. This practice is designed to 
      detect errors early before you try to use the external key with the KMS key.
      External key in use
      Each KMS key in an external key store must use a diﬀerent external key. When CreateKey
      recognizes that the external key ID (XksKeyId) for a KMS key is not unique in the external key store, 
      it fails with an XksKeyAlreadyInUseException.

      If you use multiple IDs for the same external key, CreateKey won't recognize the duplicate. 
      However, KMS keys with the same external key are not interoperable because they have diﬀerent 
      AWS KMS key material and metadata.
      External key not found
      When the external key store proxy reports that it cannot ﬁnd the external key using the 
      external key ID (XksKeyId) for the KMS key, the CreateKey operation fails and returns
      XksKeyNotFoundException with the following error message.
        The external key store proxy rejected the request because it could not ﬁnd the external key.
      This error might occur for the following reasons:
      •
        The ID of the external key (XksKeyId) for the KMS key might be invalid. To ﬁnd the ID for your 
        external key proxy uses to identify the external key, see your external key store proxy or external

      • The external key might have been deleted from your external key manager. To investigate, use 
        your external key manager tools. If the external key is permanently deleted, use a diﬀerent 
        external key with the KMS key. For a list or requirements for the external key, see Requirements 
        for a KMS key in an external key store.
      External key requirements not met
      When the external key store proxy reports that the external key does not fulﬁll the 
      requirements for use with a KMS key, the CreateKey operation fails and returns
      XksKeyInvalidConfigurationException with one of the following error messages.
        The key spec of the external key must be AES_256. The key spec of speciﬁed external key is
        <key-spec> .
      • The external key must be a 256-bit symmetric encryption key with a key spec of AES_256. If 
        the speciﬁed external key is a diﬀerent type, specify the ID of an external key that fulﬁlls this 
        requirement.

      • The external key must be enabled in the external key manager. If the speciﬁed external key is not 
        enabled, use your external key manager tools to enable it, or specify an enabled external key.
        The key usage of the external key must include ENCRYPT and DECRYPT. The key use of speciﬁed 
        external key is <key-usage >.
      • The external key must be conﬁgured for encryption and decryption in the external key manager.

        tools to change the operations, or specify a diﬀerent external key.
      Cryptographic operation errors for the external key
      Exceptions: KMSInvalidStateException
      When the external key store proxy cannot ﬁnd the external key associated with the KMS key, or the 
      external key doesn't fulﬁll the requirements for use with a KMS key, the cryptographic operation 
      fails.
      External key issues that are detected during a cryptographic operation are more diﬃcult to resolve 
      than external key issues detected before creating the KMS key. You cannot change the external 
      key ID after the KMS key is created. If the KMS key has not yet encrypted any data, you can delete 
      the KMS key and create a new one with a diﬀerent external key ID. However, ciphertext generated 
      with the KMS key cannot be decrypted by any other KMS key, even one with the same external key, 
      because keys will have diﬀerent key metadata and diﬀerent AWS KMS key material. Instead, to the 
      extent possible, use your external key manager tools to resolve the problem with the external key.
      When the external key store proxy reports a problem with the external key, cryptographic 
      operations return KMSInvalidStateException with an error message that identiﬁes the 
      problem.

      When the external key store proxy reports that it cannot ﬁnd the external key using 
      the external key ID (XksKeyId) for the KMS key, cryptographic operations return a
      KMSInvalidStateException with the following error message.
        The external key store proxy rejected the request because it could not ﬁnd the external key.
      This error might occur for the following reasons:
      •
        The ID of the external key (XksKeyId) for the KMS key is no longer valid.
        To ﬁnd the external key ID associated with your KMS key, view the details of the KMS key. To ﬁnd 
        the ID that your external key proxy uses to identify the external key, see your external key store 
        proxy or external key manager documentation.
        AWS KMS veriﬁes the external key ID when it creates a KMS key in an external key store. 
        However, the ID might become invalid, especially if the external key ID value is an alias or 
        mutable name. You cannot change the external key ID associated with an existing KMS key. To 
        decrypt any ciphertext encrypted under the KMS key, you must re-associate the external key with 
        the existing external key ID.
        If you have not yet used the KMS key to encrypt data, you can create a new KMS key with a valid 
        external key ID. However, if you have generated ciphertext with the KMS key, you cannot use any 
        other KMS key to decrypt the ciphertext, even if uses the same external key.
      • The external key might have been deleted from your external key manager. To investigate, 
        use your external key manager tools. If possible, try to recover the key material from a copy or 
        backup of your external key manager. If the external key is permanently deleted, any ciphertext 
        encrypted under the associated KMS key is unrecoverable.
      External key conﬁguration errors
      When the external key store proxy reports that the external key doesn't fulﬁll the requirements for 
      use with a KMS key, the cryptographic operation returns KMSInvalidStateException with the 
      one of the following error messages.
        The external key store proxy rejected the request because the external key does not support the 
        requested operation.

      (cryptographic operations), UnsupportedOperationException,
      XksProxyUriUnreachableException, XksProxyInvalidResponseException (management 
      operations other than CreateKey)
      The external key store proxy mediates all communication between AWS KMS and the external key 
      manager. It translates generic AWS KMS requests into a format that your external key manager can 
      understand. If the external key store proxy doesn't conform to the AWS KMS External Key Store 
      Proxy API Speciﬁcation, or if isn't operating properly, or can't communicate with AWS KMS, you 
      won't be able to create or use KMS keys in your external key store.
      While many errors mention the external key store proxy because of its critical role in the external 
      key store architecture, those problem might originate in the external key manager or external key.
      The issues in this section relate to problems with the design or operation of the external key 
      store proxy. Resolving these issues might require a change to the proxy software. Consult your 
      proxy administrator. To help diagnose proxy issues, AWS KMS provides XKS Proxy Text Client, an 
      open source test client that veriﬁes that your external key store proxy conforms to the AWS KMS

      Proxy authorization issues
      Exceptions: CustomKeyStoreInvalidStateException, KMSInvalidStateException
      Some external key store proxies implement authorization requirements for the use of its external 
      keys. An external key store proxy is permitted, but not required, to design and implement an 
      authorization scheme that allows particular users to request particular operations under certain 
      conditions. For example, a proxy might allow a user to encrypt with a particular external key, but 
      not to decrypt with it. For more information, see External key store proxy authorization (optional).
      Proxy authorization is based on metadata that AWS KMS includes in its requests to the proxy. The
      awsSourceVpc and awsSourceVpce ﬁelds are included in the metadata only when the request is 
      from a VPC endpoint and only when the caller is in the same account as the KMS key.
        "requestMetadata": { 
            "awsPrincipalArn": string, 
            "awsSourceVpc": string, // optional 
            "awsSourceVpce": string, // optional 
            "kmsKeyArn": string, 
            "kmsOperation": string, 
            "kmsRequestId": string, 
            "kmsViaService": string // optional
        }
      When the proxy rejects a request due to an authorization failure, the related AWS KMS operation 
      fails. CreateKey returns CustomKeyStoreInvalidStateException. AWS KMS cryptographic 
      operations return KMSInvalidStateException. Both use the following error message:
        The external key store proxy denied access to the operation. Verify that the user and the 
        external key are both authorized for this operation, and try the request again.
      • To resolve the error, use your external key manager or external key store proxy tools to 
        determine why authorization failed. Then, update the procedure that caused the unauthorized 
        request or use your external key store proxy tools to update the authorization policy. You cannot 
        resolve this error in AWS KMS.

      Security of AWS Key Management Service
      Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you beneﬁt from a data center 
      and network architecture that are built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive 
      organizations.
      Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The shared responsibility model describes 
      this as security of the cloud and security in the cloud:
      • Security of the cloud – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS 
        services in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely. 
        Third-party auditors regularly test and verify the eﬀectiveness of our security as part of the
        AWS Compliance Programs. To learn about the compliance programs that apply to AWS Key 
        Management Service (AWS KMS), see AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program.
      • Security in the cloud – Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use. In 
        AWS KMS, in addition to your conﬁguration and use of AWS KMS keys, you are responsible for 
        other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your company’s requirements, and applicable 
        laws and regulations
      This documentation helps you understand how to apply the shared responsibility model when 
      using AWS Key Management Service. It shows you how to conﬁgure AWS KMS to meet your 
      security and compliance objectives.

      Protecting key material
      By default, AWS KMS generates and protects the cryptographic key material for KMS keys. In 
      addition, AWS KMS oﬀers options for key material that is created and protected outside of AWS 
      KMS.
      Protecting key material generated in AWS KMS
      When you create a KMS key, by default, AWS KMS generates and protects the cryptographic 
      material for the KMS key.
      To safeguard key material for KMS keys, AWS KMS relies on a distributed ﬂeet of FIPS 140-3 
      Security Level 3–validated hardware security modules (HSMs). Each AWS KMS HSM is a dedicated, 
      standalone hardware appliance designed to provide dedicated cryptographic functions to meet the 
      security and scalability requirements of AWS KMS. (The HSMs that AWS KMS uses in China Regions 
      are certiﬁed by OSCCA and comply with all pertinent Chinese regulations, but are not validated 
      under the FIPS 140-3 Cryptographic Module Validation Program.)
      The key material for a KMS key is encrypted by default when it is generated in the HSM. The key 
      material is decrypted only within HSM volatile memory and only for the few milliseconds that 
      it takes to use it in a cryptographic operation. Whenever the key material is not in active use, it 
      is encrypted within the HSM and transferred to highly durable (99.999999999%), low-latency 
      persistent storage where it remains separate and isolated from the HSMs. Plaintext key material 
      never leaves the HSM security boundary; it is never written to disk or persisted in any storage 
      medium. (The only exception is the public key of an asymmetric key pair, which is not secret.)
      AWS asserts as a fundamental security principle that there is no human interaction with plaintext 
      cryptographic key material of any type in any AWS service. There is no mechanism for anyone, 
      including AWS service operators, to view, access, or export plaintext key material. This principle 
      applies even during catastrophic failures and disaster recovery events. Plaintext customer key 
      material in AWS KMS is used for cryptographic operations within AWS KMS FIPS 140-3 validated 
      HSMs only in response to authorized requests made to the service by the customer or their 
      delegate.
      Protecting key material                                                      754
      AWS Key Management Service                                           Developer Guide
      For customer managed keys, the AWS account that creates the key is the sole and non-transferable 
      owner of the key. The owning account has complete and exclusive control over the authorization 
      policies that control access to the key. For AWS managed keys, the AWS account has complete 
      control over the IAM policies that authorize requests to the AWS service.
      Protecting key material generated outside of AWS KMS
      AWS KMS provides alternatives to key material generated in AWS KMS.
      Custom key stores, an optional AWS KMS feature, let you create KMS keys backed by key material 
      that is generated and used outside of AWS KMS. KMS keys in AWS CloudHSM key stores are backed 
      by keys in AWS CloudHSM hardware security modules that you control. These HSMs are certiﬁed at
      FIPS 140-2 Security Level 3 or 140-3 Security Level 3. KMS keys in external key stores are backed 
      by keys in an external key manager that you control and manage outside of AWS, such as a physical 
      HSM in your private data center.
      Another optional feature lets you import the key material for a KMS key. To protect imported key 
      material while it is in transit to AWS KMS, you encrypt the key material using a public key from an 
      RSA key pair generated in an AWS KMS HSM. The imported key material is decrypted in an AWS 
      KMS HSM and re-encrypted under a symmetric key in the HSM. Like all AWS KMS key material, 
      plaintext imported key material never leaves the HSMs unencrypted. However, the customer who 
      provided the key material is responsible for secure use, durability, and maintenance of the key 
      material outside of AWS KMS.
      Data encryption
      The data in AWS KMS consists of AWS KMS keys and the encryption key material they represent. 
      This key material exists in plaintext only within AWS KMS hardware security modules (HSMs) 
      and only when in use. Otherwise, the key material is encrypted and stored in durable persistent 
      storage.
      The key material that AWS KMS generates for KMS keys never leaves the boundary of AWS 
      KMS HSMs unencrypted. It is not exported or transmitted in any AWS KMS API operations. The 
      exception is for multi-Region keys, where AWS KMS uses a cross-Region replication mechanism 
      to copy the key material for a multi-Region key from an HSM in one AWS Region to an HSM in 
      a diﬀerent AWS Region. For details, see Replication process for multi-Region keys in AWS Key 
      Management Service Cryptographic Details.

      Encryption at rest
      AWS KMS generates key material for AWS KMS keys in FIPS 140-3 Security Level 3–compliant 
      hardware security modules (HSMs). The only exception is China Regions, where the HSMs that 
      AWS KMS uses to generate KMS keys comply with all pertinent Chinese regulations, but are not 
      validated under the FIPS 140-3 Cryptographic Module Validation Program. When not in use, key 
      material is encrypted by an HSM key and written to durable, persistent storage. The key material 
      for KMS keys and the encryption keys that protect the key material never leave the HSMs in 
      plaintext form.
      Encryption and management of key material for KMS keys is handled entirely by AWS KMS.
      For more details, see Working with AWS KMS keys in AWS Key Management Service Cryptographic 
      Details.
      Encryption in transit
      Key material that AWS KMS generates for KMS keys is never exported or transmitted in AWS 
      KMS API operations. AWS KMS uses key identiﬁers to represent the KMS keys in API operations. 
      Similarly, key material for KMS keys in AWS KMS custom key stores is non-exportable and never 
      transmitted in AWS KMS or AWS CloudHSM API operations.
      However, some AWS KMS API operations return data keys. Also, customers can use API operations 
      to import key material for selected KMS keys.
      All AWS KMS API calls must be signed and transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). AWS 
      KMS requires TLS 1.2 and recommends TLS 1.3 in all regions. AWS KMS also supports hybrid post-
      quantum TLS for AWS KMS service endpoints in all regions, except China Regions. AWS KMS does 
      not support hybrid post-quantum TLS for FIPS endpoints in AWS GovCloud (US). Calls to AWS 
      KMS also require a modern cipher suite that supports perfect forward secrecy, which means that 
      compromise of any secret, such as a private key, does not also compromise the session key.
      If you require FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through a 
      command line interface or an API, use a FIPS endpoint. To use standard AWS KMS endpoints or 
      AWS KMS FIPS endpoints, clients must support TLS 1.2 or later. For more information about the 
      available FIPS endpoints, see Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3. For a list of 
      Data encryption                                                                   756

      AWS KMS FIPS endpoints, see AWS Key Management Service endpoints and quotas in the AWS 
      General Reference.
      Communications between AWS KMS service hosts and HSMs are protected using Elliptic Curve 
      Cryptography (ECC) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in an authenticated encryption 
      scheme. For more details, see Internal communication security in AWS Key Management Service 
      Cryptographic Details.
      Internetwork traﬃc privacy
      AWS KMS supports an AWS Management Console and a set of API operations that enable you to 
      create and manage AWS KMS keys and use them in cryptographic operations.
      AWS KMS supports two network connectivity options from your private network to AWS.
      • An IPSec VPN connection over the internet
      • AWS Direct Connect, which links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a 
        standard Ethernet ﬁber-optic cable.
      All AWS KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). 
      The calls also require a modern cipher suite that supports perfect forward secrecy. Traﬃc to the 
      hardware security modules (HSMs) that store key material for KMS keys is permitted only from 
      known AWS KMS API hosts over the AWS internal network.
      To connect directly to AWS KMS from your virtual private cloud (VPC) without sending traﬃc over 
      the public internet, use VPC endpoints, powered by AWS PrivateLink. For more information, see
      Connect to AWS KMS through a VPC endpoint.
      AWS KMS also supports a hybrid post-quantum key exchange option for the Transport Layer 
      Security (TLS) network encryption protocol. You can use this option with TLS when you connect to 
      AWS KMS API endpoints.
      Identity and access management for AWS Key Management 
      Service
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) helps you securely control access to AWS resources. 
      Administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to

      Key policies are the primary mechanism for controlling access to KMS keys in AWS KMS. Every KMS 
      key must have a key policy. You can also use IAM policies and grants, along with key policies, to 
      control access to your KMS keys. For more information, see KMS key access and permissions.
      If you are using an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can create an interface VPC 
      endpoint to AWS KMS powered by AWS PrivateLink. You can also use VPC endpoint policies to 
      determine which principals can access your AWS KMS endpoint, which API calls they can make, and 
      which KMS key they can access.

      AWS managed policies for AWS Key Management Service
      An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS 
      managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can 
      start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.
      Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your 
      speciﬁc use cases because they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you 
      reduce permissions further by deﬁning  customer managed policies that are speciﬁc to your use 
      cases.
      You cannot change the permissions deﬁned in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the 
      permissions deﬁned in an AWS managed policy, the update aﬀects all principal identities (users, 
      groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed 
      policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing 
      services.
      For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide.
      AWS managed policy: AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser
      You can attach the AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser policy to your IAM identities.
      You can use the AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser managed policy to give IAM principals 
      in your account the permissions of a power user. Power users can create KMS keys, use and manage 
      AWS managed policies                                                                    758

      the KMS keys they create, and view all KMS keys and IAM identities. Principals who have the
      AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser managed policy can also get permissions from other 
      sources, including key policies, other IAM policies, and grants.
      AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser is an AWS managed IAM policy. For more information 
      about AWS managed policies, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide.
           Note
           Permissions in this policy that are speciﬁc to a KMS key, such as kms:TagResource and
           kms:GetKeyRotationStatus, are eﬀective only when the key policy for that KMS 
           key explicitly allows the AWS account to use IAM policies to control access to the key. To 
           determine whether a permission is speciﬁc to a KMS key, see AWS KMS permissions and 
           look for a value of KMS key in the Resources column.
           This policy gives a power user permissions on any KMS key with a key policy that 
           permits the operation. For cross-account permissions, such as kms:DescribeKey and
           kms:ListGrants, this might include KMS keys in untrusted AWS accounts. For details, 
           see Best practices for IAM policies and Allowing users in other accounts to use a KMS key. 
           To determine whether a permission is valid on KMS keys in other accounts, see AWS KMS 
           permissions and look for a value of Yes in the Cross-account use column.
           To allow principals to view the AWS KMS console without errors, the 
           principal needs the tag:GetResources permission, which is not included in the
           AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser policy. You can allow this permission in a 
           separate IAM policy.
      The AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser managed IAM policy includes the following 
      permissions.
      • Allows principals to create KMS keys. Because this process includes setting the key policy, power 
        users can give themselves and others permission to use and manage the KMS keys they create.
      • Allows principals to create and delete aliases and tags on all KMS keys. Changing a tag or alias 
        can allow or deny permission to use and manage the KMS key. For details, see ABAC for AWS 
        KMS.
      • Allows principals to get detailed information about all KMS keys, including their key ARN, 
        cryptographic conﬁguration, key policy, aliases, tags, and rotation status.
      • Allows principals to list IAM users, groups, and roles.

      • This policy does not allow principals to use or manage KMS keys that they didn't create. 
        However, they can change aliases and tags on all KMS keys, which might allow or deny them

      Using service-linked roles for AWS KMS
      AWS Key Management Service uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked 
      roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to AWS KMS. Service-
      linked roles are deﬁned by AWS KMS and include all the permissions that the service requires to 
      call other AWS services on your behalf.
      A service-linked role makes setting up AWS KMS easier because you don’t have to manually add 
      the necessary permissions. AWS KMS deﬁnes the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless 
      deﬁned otherwise, only AWS KMS can assume its roles. The deﬁned permissions include the trust 
      policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM 
      entity.
      You can delete a service-linked role only after ﬁrst deleting the related resources. This protects 
      your AWS KMS resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission to access the 
      resources.
      For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS Services That Work 
      with IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column. Choose a Yes
      with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.

      Authorizing AWS KMS to manage AWS CloudHSM and Amazon EC2 resources
      To support your AWS CloudHSM key stores, AWS KMS needs permission to get information about 
      your AWS CloudHSM clusters. It also needs permission to create the network infrastructure that 
      connects your AWS CloudHSM key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster. To get these permissions, 
      AWS KMS creates the AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceCustomKeyStores service-
      linked role in your AWS account. Users who create AWS CloudHSM key stores must have the
      iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission that allows them to create service-linked roles.

      About the AWS KMS service-linked role
      A service-linked role is an IAM role that gives one AWS service permission to call other AWS 
      services on your behalf. It's designed to make it easier for you to use the features of multiple 
      integrated AWS services without having to create and maintain complex IAM policies. For more 
      information, see Using service-linked roles for AWS KMS.
      For AWS CloudHSM key stores, AWS KMS creates the
      AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceCustomKeyStores service-linked role with the
      AWSKeyManagementServiceCustomKeyStoresServiceRolePolicy managed policy. This policy 
      grants the role the following permissions:
      • cloudhsm:Describe* – detects changes in the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is attached to your 
        custom key store.
      • ec2:CreateSecurityGroup – used when you connect an AWS CloudHSM key store to create the 
        security group that enables network traﬃc ﬂow between AWS KMS and your AWS CloudHSM 
        cluster.
      • ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress – used when you connect an AWS CloudHSM key store to 
        allow network access from AWS KMS into the VPC that contains your AWS CloudHSM cluster.
      • ec2:CreateNetworkInterface – used when you connect an AWS CloudHSM key store to create the 
        network interface used for communication between AWS KMS and the AWS CloudHSM cluster.
      • ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress – used when you connect an AWS CloudHSM key store to 
        remove all outbound rules from the security group that AWS KMS created.

      Regions
      Like the AWS CloudHSM key stores feature, the
      AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceCustomKeyStores role is supported in all AWS 
      Regions where AWS KMS and AWS CloudHSM are available. For a list of AWS Regions that each 
      service supports, see AWS Key Management Service Endpoints and Quotas and AWS CloudHSM 
      endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
      For more information about how AWS services use service-linked roles, see Using service-linked 
      roles in the IAM User Guide.
      Create the service-linked role
      AWS KMS automatically creates the
      AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceCustomKeyStores service-linked role in your AWS 
      account when you create an AWS CloudHSM key store, if the role does not already exist. You 
      cannot create or re-create this service-linked role directly.
      Edit the service-linked role description
      You cannot edit the role name or the policy statements in the
      AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceCustomKeyStores service-linked role, but you can 
      edit role description. For instructions, see Editing a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.
      Delete the service-linked role
      AWS KMS does not delete the AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceCustomKeyStores
      service-linked role from your AWS account even if you have deleted all of your AWS 
      CloudHSM key stores. Although there is currently no procedure for deleting the
      AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceCustomKeyStores service-linked role, AWS KMS does 
      not assume this role or use its permissions unless you have active AWS CloudHSM key stores.
      Authorizing AWS KMS to synchronize multi-Region keys
      To support multi-Region keys, AWS KMS needs permission to synchronize the shared properties
      of a multi-Region primary key with its replica keys. To get these permissions, AWS KMS creates 
      the AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceMultiRegionKeys service-linked role in your AWS 
      Service-linked roles                                                                    765

      A service-linked role is an IAM role that gives one AWS service permission to call other AWS 
      services on your behalf. It's designed to make it easier for you to use the features of multiple 
      integrated AWS services without having to create and maintain complex IAM policies.
      For multi-Region keys, AWS KMS creates the
      AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceMultiRegionKeys service-linked role with the
      AWSKeyManagementServiceMultiRegionKeysServiceRolePolicy managed policy. This policy gives 
      the role the kms:SynchronizeMultiRegionKey permission, which allows it to synchronize the 
      shared properties of multi-Region keys.
      Because the AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceMultiRegionKeys service-linked role 
      trusts only mrk.kms.amazonaws.com, only AWS KMS can assume this service-linked role. 
      This role is limited to the operations that AWS KMS needs to synchronize multi-Region shared 
      properties. It does not give AWS KMS any additional permissions. For example, AWS KMS does not 
      have permission to create, replicate, or delete any KMS keys.

      Create the service-linked role
      AWS KMS automatically creates the AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceMultiRegionKeys
      service-linked role in your AWS account when you create a multi-Region key, if the role does not 
      already exist. You cannot create or re-create this service-linked role directly.
      Edit the service-linked role description
      You cannot edit the role name or the policy statements in the
      AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceMultiRegionKeys service-linked role, but you can edit 
      the role description. For instructions, see Editing a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
      Delete the service-linked role
      AWS KMS does not delete the AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceMultiRegionKeys
      service-linked role from your AWS account and you cannot delete it. However, AWS KMS does not 
      assume the AWSServiceRoleForKeyManagementServiceMultiRegionKeys role or use any of its 
      permissions unless you have multi-Region keys in your AWS account and Region.
      Logging and monitoring in AWS Key Management Service
      Monitoring is an important part of understanding the availability, state, and usage of your 
      AWS KMS keys in AWS KMS. Monitoring helps maintain the security, reliability, availability, and 
      performance of your AWS solutions. AWS provides several tools for monitoring your KMS keys.
      AWS CloudTrail Logs
         Every call to an AWS KMS API operation is captured as an event in an AWS CloudTrail log. These 
         logs record all API calls from the AWS KMS console, and calls made by AWS KMS and other AWS 
      Logging and monitoring                                                                  767
      AWS Key Management Service                                                 Developer Guide
         services. Cross-account API calls, such as a call to use a KMS key in a diﬀerent AWS account, are 
         recorded in the CloudTrail logs of both accounts.
         When troubleshooting or auditing, you can use the log to reconstruct the lifecycle of a KMS 
         key. You can also view its management and use of the KMS key in cryptographic operations. For 
         more information, see the section called “Logging with AWS CloudTrail”.
      Amazon CloudWatch Logs
         Monitor, store, and access your log ﬁles from AWS CloudTrail and other sources. For more 
         information, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
         For AWS KMS, CloudWatch stores useful information that helps you to prevent problems with 
         your KMS keys and the resources that they protect. For more information, see the section called 
         “Monitor keys with CloudWatch”.
      Amazon EventBridge
         AWS KMS generates EventBridge events when your KMS key is rotated or deleted or the
         imported key material in your KMS key expires. Search for AWS KMS events (API operations) and 
         route them to one or more target functions or streams to capture state information. For more 
         information, see the section called “Monitor keys with Amazon EventBridge” and the Amazon 
         EventBridge User Guide.
      Amazon CloudWatch Metrics
         You can monitor your KMS keys using CloudWatch metrics, which collects and processes raw 
         data from AWS KMS into performance metrics. The data are recorded in two-week intervals so 
         you can view trends of current and historical information. This helps you to understand how 
         your KMS keys are used and how their use changes over time. For information about using 
         CloudWatch metrics to monitor KMS keys, see AWS KMS metrics and dimensions.
      Amazon CloudWatch Alarms
         Watch a single metric change over a time period that you specify. Then perform actions based 
         on the value of the metric relative to a threshold over a number of time periods. For example, 
         you can create a CloudWatch alarm that is triggered when someone tries to use a KMS key that 
         is scheduled to be deleted in a cryptographic operation. This indicates that the KMS key is still 
         being used and probably should not be deleted. For more information, see the section called 
         “Create an alarm”.

      AWS Security Hub
         You can monitor your AWS KMS usage for security industry standards and best practices 
         compliance using AWS Security Hub. Security Hub uses security controls to evaluate resource 
         conﬁgurations and security standards to help you comply with various compliance frameworks.

      Resilience in AWS Key Management Service
      The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Regions 
      provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with 
      low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With Availability Zones, you can 
      design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between Availability 
      Zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and 
      scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures.
      In addition to the AWS global infrastructure, AWS KMS oﬀers several features to help support your 
      data resiliency and backup needs. For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, 
      see AWS Global Infrastructure.
      Learn more                                                                            770
     AWS Key Management Service                                       Developer Guide
     Regional isolation
     AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a self-sustaining Regional service that is available 
     in all AWS Regions. The Regionally isolated design of AWS KMS ensures that an availability issue 
     in one AWS Region cannot aﬀect AWS KMS operation in any other Region. AWS KMS is designed 
     to ensure zero planned downtime, with all software updates and scaling operations performed 
     seamlessly and imperceptibly.
     The AWS KMS Service Level Agreement (SLA) includes a service commitment of 99.999% for all 
     KMS APIs. To fulﬁll this commitment, AWS KMS ensures that all data and authorization information 
     required to execute an API request is available on all regional hosts that receive the request.
     The AWS KMS infrastructure is replicated in at least three Availability Zones (AZs) in each Region. 
     To ensure that multiple host failures do not aﬀect AWS KMS performance, AWS KMS is designed to 
     service customer traﬃc from any of the AZs in a Region.
     Changes that you make to the properties or permissions of a KMS key are replicated to all hosts in 
     the Region to ensure that subsequent request can be processed correctly by any host in the Region. 
     Requests for cryptographic operations using your KMS key are forwarded to a ﬂeet of AWS KMS 
     hardware security modules (HSMs), any of which can perform the operation with the KMS key.
     Multi-tenant design
     The multi-tenant design of AWS KMS enables it to fulﬁll the 99.999% availability SLA, and to 
     sustain high request rates, while protecting the conﬁdentiality of your keys and data.
     Multiple integrity-enforcing mechanisms are deployed to ensure that the KMS key that you 
     speciﬁed for the cryptographic operation is always the one that is used.
     The plaintext key material for your KMS keys is protected extensively. The key material is encrypted 
     in the HSM as soon as it is created, and the encrypted key material is immediately moved to secure, 
     low latency storage. The encrypted key is retrieved and decrypted within the HSM just in time 
     for use. The plaintext key remains in HSM memory only for the time needed to complete the 
     cryptographic operation. Then it is re-encrypted in the HSM and the encrypted key is returned to 
     storage. Plaintext key material never leaves the HSMs; it is never written to persistent storage.
     Resilience best practices in AWS KMS
     To optimize resilience for your AWS KMS resources, consider the following strategies.
     Regional isolation                                                     771
     AWS Key Management Service                                  Developer Guide
     • To support your backup and disaster recovery strategy, consider multi-Region keys, which are 
       KMS keys created in one AWS Region and replicated only to Regions that you specify. With 
       multi-Region keys, you can move encrypted resources between AWS Regions (within the same 
       partition) without ever exposing the plaintext, and decrypt the resource, when needed, in any 
       of its destination Regions. Related multi-Region keys are interoperable because they share the 
       same key material and key ID, but they have independent key policies for high-resolution access 
       control. For details, see Multi-Region keys in AWS KMS.
     • To protect your keys in a multi-tenant service like AWS KMS, be sure to use access controls, 
       including key policies and IAM policies. In addition, you can send your requests to AWS KMS 
       using a VPC interface endpoint powered by AWS PrivateLink. When you do, all communication 
       between your Amazon VPC and AWS KMS is conducted entirely within the AWS network using 
       a dedicated AWS KMS endpoint restricted to your VPC. You can further secure these requests 
       by creating an additional authorization layer using VPC endpoint policies. For details, see
       Connecting to AWS KMS through a VPC endpoint.
     Infrastructure security in AWS Key Management Service
     As a managed service, AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is protected by the AWS global 
     network security procedures that are described in the Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security 
     Processes.
     To access AWS KMS over the network, you can call the AWS KMS API operations that are described 
     in the AWS Key Management Service API Reference. AWS KMS requires TLS 1.2 and recommends 
     TLS 1.3 in all regions. AWS KMS also supports hybrid post-quantum TLS for AWS KMS service 
     endpoints in all regions, except China Regions. AWS KMS does not support hybrid post-quantum 
     TLS for FIPS endpoints in AWS GovCloud (US). To use standard AWS KMS endpoints or AWS KMS 
     FIPS endpoints, clients must support TLS 1.2 or later. Clients must also support cipher suites with 
     perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diﬃe-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral 
     Diﬃe-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems, such as Java 7 and later, support these modes.
     Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is 
     associated with an IAM principal. Or you can use the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to 
     generate temporary security credentials to sign requests.
     You can call these API operations from any network location, but AWS KMS supports global policy 
     conditions that let you control access to a KMS key based on the source IP address, VPC, and 
     VPC endpoint. You can use these condition keys in key policies and IAM policies. However, these 
     Infrastructure security                                           772

      conditions can prevent AWS from using the KMS key on your behalf. For details, see AWS global 
      condition keys.
      For example, the following key policy statement allows users who can assume the KMSTestRole
      role to use this AWS KMS key for the speciﬁed cryptographic operations unless the source IP 
      address is one of the IP addresses speciﬁed in the policy.

      Isolation of Physical Hosts
      The security of the physical infrastructure that AWS KMS uses is subject to the controls described 
      in the Physical and Environmental Security section of the Amazon Web Services: Overview of 
      Security Processes. You can ﬁnd more detail in compliance reports and third-party audit ﬁndings 
      listed in the previous section.
      AWS KMS is supported by dedicated hardened hardware security modules (HSMs) designed 
      with speciﬁc controls to resist physical attacks. The HSMs are physical devices that do not

     have a virtualization layer, such as a hypervisor, that shares the physical device among several 
     logical tenants. The key material for AWS KMS keys is stored only in volatile memory on the 
     HSMs, and only while the KMS key is in use. This memory is erased when the HSM moves 
     out of the operational state, including intended and unintended shutdowns and resets. For 
     detailed information about the operation of AWS KMS HSMs, see AWS Key Management Service 
     Cryptographic Details.

      Quotas
      To make AWS KMS responsive and performant for all users, AWS KMS applies two types of quotas, 
      resource quotas and request quotas. Each quota is calculated independently for each Region of 
      each AWS account.
      All AWS KMS quotas are adjustable, except for the on-demand rotation resource quota and the
      AWS CloudHSM key store request quota. To request a quota increase, see Requesting a quota 
      increase in the Service Quotas User Guide. To request a quota decrease, to change a quota that is 
      not listed in Service Quotas, or to change a quota in an AWS Region where Service Quotas for AWS 
      KMS is not available, please visit AWS Support Center and create a case.

      Resource quotas
      AWS KMS establishes resource quotas to ensure that it can provide fast and resilient service to 
      all of our customers. Some resource quotas apply only to resources that you create, but not to 
      resources that AWS services create for you. Resources that you use, but that aren't in your AWS 
      account, such as AWS owned keys, do not count against these quotas.
      If you have exceeded a resource limit, requests to create an additional resource of that type 
      generate an LimitExceededException error message.
      All AWS KMS resource quotas are adjustable, except for the on-demand rotation resource quota. 
      To request a quota increase, see Requesting a quota increase in the Service Quotas User Guide. 
      To request a quota decrease, to change a quota that is not listed in Service Quotas, or to change

      In addition to resource quotas, AWS KMS uses request quotas to ensure the responsiveness of the 
      service. For details, see the section called “Request quotas”.
      AWS KMS keys: 100,000
      You can have up to 100,000 customer managed keys in each Region of your AWS account. This 
      quota applies to all customer managed keys in all AWS Regions regardless of their key spec or key 
      state. Each KMS key is considered to be one resource. AWS managed keys and AWS owned keys do 
      not count against this quota.
      Aliases per KMS key: 50
      You can associate up to 50 aliases with each customer managed key. Aliases that AWS associates 
      with AWS managed keys do not count against this quota. You might encounter this quota when 
      you create or update an alias.
           Note
           The kms:ResourceAliases condition is eﬀective only when the KMS key conforms to this 
           quota. If a KMS key exceeds this quota, principals who are authorized to use the KMS key

           Access denied due to alias quota.
      The Aliases per KMS key quota replaces the Aliases per Region quota that limited the total number 
      of aliases in each Region of an AWS account. AWS KMS has eliminated the Aliases per Region 
      quota.
      Grants per KMS key: 50,000
      Each customer managed key can have up to 50,000 grants, including the grants created by AWS 
      services that are integrated with AWS KMS. This quota does not apply to AWS managed keys or
      AWS owned keys.
      One eﬀect of this quota is that you cannot perform more than 50,000 grant-authorized operations 
      that use the same KMS key at the same time. After you reach the quota, you can create new grants 
      on the KMS key only when an active grant is retired or revoked.
      For example, when you attach an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume to an Amazon 
      Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, the volume is decrypted so you can read it. To get 
      permission to decrypt the data, Amazon EBS creates a grant for each volume. Therefore, if all of 
      your Amazon EBS volumes use the same KMS key, you cannot attach more than 50,000 volumes at 
      one time.
      Custom key stores resource quota: 10
      You can create up to 10 custom key stores in each AWS account and Region. If you try to create 
      more, the CreateCustomKeyStore operation fails.
      This quota applies to the total number of custom key stores in each account and region, including 
      all AWS CloudHSM key stores and external key stores, regardless of their connection state.
      On-demand rotation: 10
      You can perform on-demand key rotation a maximum of 10 times per KMS key. If you try to 
      perform more on-demand rotations, the RotateKeyOnDemand operation fails.
      This quota is not adjustable. You cannot increase it by using Service Quotas or by creating a case in 
      AWS Support. To prevent reaching the on-demand rotation quota, we recommend using automatic 
      key rotation whenever possible.

     Request quotas
     AWS KMS establishes quotas for the number of API operations requested in each second. The 
     request quotas diﬀer with the API operation, the AWS Region, and other factors, such as the KMS 
     key type. When you exceed an API request quota, AWS KMS throttles the request.
     All AWS KMS request quotas are adjustable, except for the AWS CloudHSM key store request quota. 
     To request a quota increase, see Requesting a quota increase in the Service Quotas User Guide. 
     To request a quota decrease, to change a quota that is not listed in Service Quotas, or to change 
     a quota in an AWS Region where Service Quotas for AWS KMS is not available, please visit AWS 
     Support Center and create a case.
     If you are exceeding the request quota for the GenerateDataKey operation, consider using the data 
     key caching feature of the AWS Encryption SDK. Reusing data keys might reduce the frequency of 
     your requests to AWS KMS.
     In addition to request quotas, AWS KMS uses resource quotas to ensure capacity for all users. For 
     details, see Resource quotas.
     To view trends in your request rates, use the Service Quotas console. You can also create an
     Amazon CloudWatch alarm that alerts you when your request rate reaches a certain percentage of 
     a quota value. For details, see Manage your AWS KMS API request rates using Service Quotas and 
     Amazon CloudWatch in the AWS Security Blog.

      Applying request quotas
      When reviewing request quotas, keep in mind the following information.
      Applying request quotas                                                                785
     AWS Key Management Service                                    Developer Guide
     • Request quotas apply to both customer managed keys and AWS managed keys. The use of AWS 
       owned keys does not count against request quotas for your AWS account, even when they are 
       used to protect resources in your account.
     • Request quotas apply to requests sent to FIPS endpoints and non-FIPS endpoints. For a list of 
       AWS KMS service endpoints, see AWS Key Management Service endpoints and quotas in the AWS 
       General Reference.
     • Throttling is based on all requests on KMS keys of all types in the Region. This total includes 
       requests from all principals in the AWS account, including requests from AWS services on your 
       behalf.
     • Each request quota is calculated independently. For example, requests for the CreateKey
       operation have no eﬀect on the request quota for the CreateAlias operation. If your
       CreateAlias requests are throttled, your CreateKey requests can still complete successfully.
     • Although cryptographic operations share a quota, the shared quota is calculated independently 
       of quotas for other operations. For example, calls to the Encrypt and Decrypt operations share a 
       request quota, but that quota is independent of the quota for management operations, such as
       EnableKey. For example, in the Europe (London) Region, you can perform 10,000 cryptographic 
       operations on symmetric KMS keys plus 5 EnableKey operations per second without being 
       throttled.
     Shared quotas for cryptographic operations
     AWS KMS cryptographic operations share request quotas. You can request any combination 
     of the cryptographic operations that are supported by the KMS key, just so the total number 
     of cryptographic operations doesn't exceed the request quota for that type of KMS key. The 
     exceptions are GenerateDataKeyPair and GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext, which share a 
     separate quota.
     The quotas for diﬀerent types of KMS keys are calculated independently. Each quota applies to all 
     requests for these operations in the AWS account and Region with the given key type in each one-
     second interval.
     • Cryptographic operations (symmetric) request rate is the shared request quota for cryptographic 
       operations using symmetric KMS keys in an account and region. This quota applies to 
       cryptographic operations with symmetric encryption keys and HMAC keys, which are also 
       symmetric.
     Shared quotas for cryptographic operations                          786
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
        For example, you might be using symmetric KMS keys in an AWS Region with a shared quota of 
        10,000 requests per second. When you make 7,000 GenerateDataKey requests per second and 
        2,000 Decrypt requests per second, AWS KMS doesn't throttle your requests. However, when you 
        make 9,500 GenerateDataKey requests and 1,000 Encrypt and requests per second, AWS KMS 
        throttles your requests because they exceed the shared quota.
        Cryptographic operations on the symmetric encryption KMS keys in a custom key store count 
        toward both the Cryptographic operations (symmetric) request rate for the account and the
        custom key store request quota for the custom key store.
      • Cryptographic operations (RSA) request rate is the shared request quota for cryptographic 
        operations using RSA asymmetric KMS keys.
        For example, with a request quota of 1,000 operations per second, you can make 400 Encrypt
        requests and 200 Decrypt requests with RSA KMS keys that can encrypt and decrypt, plus 250
        Sign requests and 150 Verify requests with RSA KMS keys that can sign and verify.
      • Cryptographic operations (ECC) request rate is the shared request quota for cryptographic 
        operations using elliptic curve (ECC) asymmetric KMS keys and SM asymmetric KMS keys.
        For example, with a request quota of 1,000 operations per second, you can make 400 Sign 
        requests and 200 Verify requests with ECC KMS keys that can sign and verify, plus 250 Sign
        requests and 150 Verify requests with SM2 KMS keys that can sign and verify.
      • Custom key store request quota is the shared request quota for cryptographic operations on KMS 
        keys in a custom key store. This quota is calculated separately for each custom key store.
        Cryptographic operations on the symmetric encryption KMS keys in a custom key store count 
        toward both the Cryptographic operations (symmetric) request rate for the account and the
        custom key store request quota for the custom key store.
      The quotas for diﬀerent key types are also calculated independently. For example, in the Asia 
      Paciﬁc (Singapore) Region, if you use both symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, you can make 
      up to 10,000 calls per second with symmetric KMS keys (including HMAC keys) plus up to 500 
      additional calls per second with your RSA asymmetric KMS keys, plus up to 300 additional requests 
      per second with your ECC-based KMS keys.
      Shared quotas for cryptographic operations                                              787
       AWS Key Management Service                                                        Developer Guide
       API requests made on your behalf
       You can make API requests directly or by using an integrated AWS service that makes API requests 
       to AWS KMS on your behalf. The quota applies to both kinds of requests.
       For example, you might store data in Amazon S3 using server-side encryption with a KMS key (SSE-
       KMS). Each time you upload or download an S3 object that's encrypted with SSE-KMS, Amazon S3 
       makes a GenerateDataKey (for uploads) or Decrypt (for downloads) request to AWS KMS on 
       your behalf. These requests count toward your quota, so AWS KMS throttles the requests if you 
       exceed a combined total of 5,500 (or 10,000 or 50,000 depending upon your AWS Region) uploads 
       or downloads per second of S3 objects encrypted with SSE-KMS.
       Cross-account requests
       When an application in one AWS account uses a KMS key owned by a diﬀerent account, it's known 
       as a cross-account request. For cross-account requests, AWS KMS throttles the account that makes 
       the requests, not the account that owns the KMS key. For example, if an application in account A 
       uses a KMS key in account B, the KMS key use applies only to the quotas in account A.
       Custom key store request quotas
       AWS KMS maintains request quotas for cryptographic operations on the KMS keys in a custom key 
       store. These request quotas are calculated separately for each custom key store.
        Custom key store request       Default value (requests per    Adjustable
        quota                          second) for each custom key

            Note
            AWS KMS custom key store request quotas do not appear in the Service Quotas console. 
            You cannot view or manage these quotas by using Service Quotas API operations. To 
       API requests made on your behalf                                                          788
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
           request a change to your external key store request quota, visit the AWS Support Center
           and create a case.
           If the AWS CloudHSM cluster associated with an AWS CloudHSM key store is processing 
           numerous commands, including those unrelated to the custom key store, you might get an 
           AWS KMS ThrottlingException at a lower-than-expected rate. If this occurs, lower your 
           request rate to AWS KMS, reduce the unrelated load, or use a dedicated AWS CloudHSM 
           cluster for your AWS CloudHSM key store.
           AWS KMS reports throttling of external key store requests in the
           ExternalKeyStoreThrottle CloudWatch metric. You can use this metric to view 
           throttling patterns, create alarms, and adjust your external key store request quota.
      A request for a cryptographic operation on a KMS key in a custom key store counts toward two 
      quotas:
      • Cryptographic operations (symmetric) request rate quota (per account)
        Requests for cryptographic operations on KMS keys in a custom key store count toward the
        Cryptographic operations (symmetric) request rate quota for each AWS account 
        and Region. For example, in US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1), each AWS account can have up to 
        100,000 requests per second on symmetric encryption KMS keys, including requests that use a 
        KMS key in a custom key store.
      • Custom key store request quota (per custom key store)
        Requests for cryptographic operations on KMS keys in a custom key store also count toward 
        a Custom key store request quota of 1,800 operations per second. These quotas are 
        calculated separately for each custom key store. They might include requests from multiple AWS 
        accounts that use KMS keys in the custom key store.
      For example, an Encrypt operation on a KMS key in a custom key store (either type) in the US East 
      (N. Virginia) (us-east-1) Region counts toward the Cryptographic operations (symmetric) 
      request rate account-level quota (100,000 requests per second) for its account and Region, and 
      toward a Custom key store request quota (1,800 requests per second) for its custom key 
      store. However, a request for a management operation, such as PutKeyPolicy, on a KMS key in a 
      custom key store applies only to its account-level quota (15 requests per second).
      Custom key store request quotas                                                         789
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      Throttling AWS KMS requests
      To ensure that AWS KMS can provide fast and reliable responses to API requests from all 
      customers, it throttles API requests that exceed certain boundaries.
      Throttling occurs when AWS KMS rejects a request that might otherwise be valid, and returns a
      ThrottlingException error like the following one.
        You have exceeded the rate at which you may call KMS. Reduce the frequency of your 
         calls.  
        (Service: AWSKMS; Status Code: 400; Error Code: ThrottlingException; Request ID: <ID>
      AWS KMS throttles requests for the following conditions.
      • The rate of requests per second exceeds the AWS KMS request quota for an account and Region.
        For example, if users in your account submit 1000 DescribeKey requests in a second, AWS KMS 
        throttles all subsequent DescribeKey requests in that second.
        To respond to throttling, use a backoﬀ and retry strategy. This strategy is implemented 
        automatically for HTTP 400 errors in some AWS SDKs.
      • A burst or sustained high rate of requests to change the state of the same KMS key. This 
        condition is often known as a "hot key."
        For example, if an application in your account sends a persistent volley of EnableKey and
        DisableKey requests for the same KMS key, AWS KMS throttles the requests. This throttling 
        occurs even if the requests don't exceed the request-per-second request limit for the EnableKey
        and DisableKey operations.
        To respond to throttling, adjust your application logic so it makes only required requests or it 
        consolidates the requests of multiple functions.
      • Requests for operations on KMS keys in a AWS CloudHSM key store might be throttled at a 
        lower-than-expected rate when the AWS CloudHSM cluster associated with the AWS CloudHSM 
        key store is processing numerous commands, including those unrelated to the AWS CloudHSM 
        key store.
        (AWS KMS no longer throttles requests for operations on KMS keys in a AWS CloudHSM key store 
        when there are no available PKCS #11 sessions for the AWS CloudHSM cluster. Instead, it throws 
        a KMSInternalException and recommends that you retry your request.)
      Throttling requests                                                                     790

      To view trends in your request rates, use the Service Quotas console. You can also create an
      Amazon CloudWatch alarm that alerts you when your request rate reaches a certain percentage of 
      a quota value. For details, see Manage your AWS KMS API request rates using Service Quotas and 
      Amazon CloudWatch in the AWS Security Blog.
      All AWS KMS quotas are adjustable, except for the on-demand rotation resource quota and the
      AWS CloudHSM key store request quota. To request a quota increase, see Requesting a quota 
      increase in the Service Quotas User Guide. To request a quota decrease, to change a quota that is 
      not listed in Service Quotas, or to change a quota in an AWS Region where Service Quotas for AWS 
      KMS is not available, please visit AWS Support Center and create a case.
          Note
          AWS KMS custom key store request quotas do not appear in the Service Quotas console. 
          You cannot view or manage these quotas by using Service Quotas API operations. To 
          request a change to your external key store request quota, visit the AWS Support Center

      Code examples for AWS KMS using AWS SDKs
      The following code examples show how to use AWS KMS with an AWS software development kit 
      (SDK).
      Basics are code examples that show you how to perform the essential operations within a service.
      Actions are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you 
      how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.
      Scenarios are code examples that show you how to accomplish speciﬁc tasks by calling multiple 
      functions within a service or combined with other AWS services.

                          This program demonstrates how to interact with AWS Key Management 
               using the AWS SDK for Java (v2). 
                          The AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a secure and highly available 
               service that allows you to create  
                          and manage AWS KMS keys and control their use across a wide range of 
               AWS services and applications.  
                          KMS provides a centralized and unified approach to managing 
               encryption keys, making it easier to meet your  
                          data protection and regulatory compliance requirements. 
                                       
                          This Basics scenario creates two key types:

                          - An asymmetric key used to digitally sign data.

                          A key policy is a resource policy for a KMS key. Key policies are the

                          access to KMS keys. Every KMS key must have exactly one key policy. 
               The statements in the key policy

                          You can also use IAM policies and grants to control access to the KMS

              Welcome to the AWS Key Management Service SDK Basics scenario. 
                       
              This program demonstrates how to interact with AWS Key Management Service using 
               the AWS SDK for PHP (v3).
              The AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a secure and highly available service 
               that allows you to create
              and manage AWS KMS keys and control their use across a wide range of AWS services 
               and applications.
              KMS provides a centralized and unified approach to managing encryption keys, 
               making it easier to meet your
              data protection and regulatory compliance requirements.
              This KMS Basics scenario creates two key types:
              - A symmetric encryption key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.
              - An asymmetric key used to digitally sign data.
              Let's get started...\n

              Welcome to the AWS Key Management SDK Basics scenario.
              This program demonstrates how to interact with AWS Key Management using the AWS 
               SDK for Python (Boto3).
              The AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a secure and highly available service 
               that allows you to create
              and manage AWS KMS keys and control their use across a wide range of AWS services 
               and applications.
              KMS provides a centralized and unified approach to managing encryption keys, 
               making it easier to meet your
              data protection and regulatory compliance requirements.
              This Basics scenario creates two key types:
              - A symmetric encryption key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.
              - An asymmetric key used to digitally sign data.

      Actions for AWS KMS using AWS SDKs
      The following code examples demonstrate how to perform individual AWS KMS actions with AWS 
      SDKs. Each example includes a link to GitHub, where you can ﬁnd instructions for setting up and 
      running the code.
      These excerpts call the AWS KMS API and are code excerpts from larger programs that must be run 
      in context. You can see actions in context in Scenarios for AWS KMS using AWS SDKs .

            The following create-alias command creates an alias named example-alias for the 
            KMS key identiﬁed by key ID 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
            Alias names must begin with alias/. Do not use alias names that begin with alias/aws; 
            these are reserved for use by AWS.
              aws kms create-alias \

            To create a grant
            The following create-grant example creates a grant that allows the exampleUser user 
            to use the decrypt command on the 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
            example KMS key. The retiring principal is the adminRole role. The grant uses the
            EncryptionContextSubset grant constraint to allow this permission only when the 
            encryption context in the decrypt request includes the "Department": "IT" key-value 
            pair.

      CLI
         AWS CLI
            Example 1: To create a customer managed KMS key in AWS KMS
            The following create-key example creates a symmetric encryption KMS key.
            To create the basic KMS key, a symmetric encryption key, you do not need to specify any 
            parameters. The default values for those parameters create a symmetric encryption key.
            Because this command doesn't specify a key policy, the KMS key gets the default key policy
            for programmatically created KMS keys. To view the key policy, use the get-key-policy
            command. To change the key policy, use the put-key-policy command.
              aws kms create-key
            The create-key command returns the key metadata, including the key ID and ARN of 
            the new KMS key. You can use these values to identify the KMS key in other AWS KMS 
            operations. The output does not include the tags. To view the tags for a KMS key, use the
            list-resource-tags command.

            Example 6: To create a multi-Region primary KMS key
            The following create-key example creates a multi-Region primary symmetric encryption 
            key. Because the default values for all parameters create a symmetric encryption key, only 
            the --multi-region parameter is required for this KMS key. In the AWS CLI, to indicate 
            that a Boolean parameter is true, just specify the parameter name.
              aws kms create-key \ 
                  --multi-region

      CLI
         AWS CLI
            Example 1: To decrypt an encrypted message with a symmetric KMS key (Linux and 
            macOS)
            The following decrypt command example demonstrates the recommended way to decrypt 
            data with the AWS CLI. This version shows how to decrypt data under a symmetric KMS key.
            Provide the ciphertext in a ﬁle.In the value of the --ciphertext-blob parameter, use 
            the fileb:// preﬁx, which tells the CLI to read the data from a binary ﬁle. If the ﬁle is 
            not in the current directory, type the full path to ﬁle. For more information about reading 
            AWS CLI parameter values from a ﬁle, see Loading AWS CLI parameters from a ﬁle <https://
            docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-ﬁle.html> in the AWS 
            Command Line Interface User Guide and Best Practices for Local File Parameters<https://
            aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/best-practices-for-local-ﬁle-parameters/> in the AWS 
            Command Line Tool Blog.Specify the KMS key to decrypt the ciphertext.The --key-id
            parameter is not required when decrypting with a symmetric KMS key. AWS KMS can get 
            the key ID of the KMS key that was used to encrypt the data from the metadata in the 
            ciphertext. But it's always a best practice to specify the KMS key you are using. This practice 
            ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend, and prevents you from inadvertently 
            decrypting a ciphertext using a KMS key you do not trust.Request the plaintext output as 
            a text value.The --query parameter tells the CLI to get only the value of the Plaintext
            ﬁeld from the output. The --output parameter returns the output as text.Base64-decode 
            the plaintext and save it in a ﬁle.The following example pipes (|) the value of the Plaintext
            parameter to the Base64 utility, which decodes it. Then, it redirects (>) the decoded output 
            to the ExamplePlaintext ﬁle.
            Before running this command, replace the example key ID with a valid key ID from your AWS 
            account.
              aws kms decrypt \ 
                  --ciphertext-blob fileb://ExampleEncryptedFile \

            This command produces no output. The output from the decrypt command is base64-
            decoded and saved in a ﬁle.
            For more information, see Decrypt in the AWS Key Management Service API Reference.
            Example 2: To decrypt an encrypted message with a symmetric KMS key (Windows 
            command prompt)
            The following example is the same as the previous one except that it uses the certutil
            utility to Base64-decode the plaintext data. This procedure requires two commands, as 
            shown in the following examples.
            Before running this command, replace the example key ID with a valid key ID from your AWS 
            account.
              aws kms decrypt ^
                  --ciphertext-blob fileb://ExampleEncryptedFile ^
                  --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab ^
                  --output text ^
                  --query Plaintext > ExamplePlaintextFile.base64
            Run the certutil command.
              certutil -decode ExamplePlaintextFile.base64 ExamplePlaintextFile
            Output:
              Input Length = 18
              Output Length = 12
              CertUtil: -decode command completed successfully.

            Example 3: To decrypt an encrypted message with an asymmetric KMS key (Linux and 
            macOS)
            The following decrypt command example shows how to decrypt data encrypted under an 
            RSA asymmetric KMS key.
            When using an asymmetric KMS key, the encryption-algorithm parameter, which 
            speciﬁes the algorithm used to encrypt the plaintext, is required.

      Use DeleteAlias with an AWS SDK or CLI
      The following code examples show how to use DeleteAlias.
      CLI
         AWS CLI
            To delete an AWS KMS alias
            The following delete-alias example deletes the alias alias/example-alias. The alias 
            name must begin with alias/.
              aws kms delete-alias \ 
                  --alias-name alias/example-alias
            This command produces no output. To ﬁnd the alias, use the list-aliases command.
            For more information, see Deleting an alias in the AWS Key Management Service Developer 
            Guide.

            The following describe-key example gets detailed information about the AWS managed 
            key for Amazon S3 in the example account and Region. You can use this command to ﬁnd 
            details about AWS managed keys and customer managed keys.
            To specify the KMS key, use the key-id parameter. This example uses an alias name value, 
            but you can use a key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN in this command.

         AWS CLI
            To enable a KMS key
            The following enable-key example enables a customer managed key. You can use a 
            command like this one to enable a KMS key that you temporarily disabled by using the
            disable-key command. You can also use it to enable a KMS key that is disabled because it 
            was scheduled for deletion and the deletion was canceled.
            To specify the KMS key, use the key-id parameter. This example uses an key ID value, but 
            you can use a key ID or key ARN value in this command.
            Before running this command, replace the example key ID with a valid one.
              aws kms enable-key \ 
                  --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
            This command produces no output. To verify that the KMS key is enabled, use the
            describe-key command. See the values of the KeyState and Enabled ﬁelds in the
            describe-key output.

      Use EnableKeyRotation with an AWS SDK or CLI
      The following code examples show how to use EnableKeyRotation.
      CLI
         AWS CLI
            To enable automatic rotation of a KMS key
            The following enable-key-rotation example enables automatic rotation of a customer 
            managed KMS key with a rotation period of 180 days. The KMS key will be rotated one 
            year (approximate 365 days) from the date that this command completes and every year 
            thereafter.
            The --key-id parameter identiﬁes the KMS key. This example uses a key ARN value, but 
            you can use either the key ID or the ARN of the KMS key.The --rotation-period-in-
            days parameter speciﬁes the number of days between each rotation date. Specify a value 
            between 90 and 2560 days. If no value is speciﬁed, the default value is 365 days.
              aws kms enable-key-rotation \

            The command does several things:
            Uses the --plaintext parameter to indicate the data to encrypt. This parameter value 
            must be base64-encoded.The value of the plaintext parameter must be base64-
            encoded, or you must use the fileb:// preﬁx, which tells the AWS CLI to read binary 
            data from the ﬁle.If the ﬁle is not in the current directory, type the full path to ﬁle. 
            For example: fileb:///var/tmp/ExamplePlaintextFile or fileb://C:\Temp
            \ExamplePlaintextFile. For more information about reading AWS CLI parameter 
            values from a ﬁle, see Loading Parameters from a File in the AWS Command Line Interface 
            User Guide and Best Practices for Local File Parameters on the AWS Command Line Tool 
            Blog.Uses the --output and --query parameters to control the command's output.These 
            parameters extract the encrypted data, called the ciphertext, from the command's 
            output.For more information about controlling output, see Controlling Command Output
            in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.Uses the base64 utility to decode the 
            extracted output into binary data.The ciphertext that is returned by a successful encrypt
            command is base64-encoded text. You must decode this text before you can use the AWS 
            CLI to decrypt it.Saves the binary ciphertext to a ﬁle.The ﬁnal part of the command (> 
            ExampleEncryptedFile) saves the binary ciphertext to a ﬁle to make decryption easier. 
            For an example command that uses the AWS CLI to decrypt data, see the decrypt examples.
            Example 2: Using the AWS CLI to encrypt data on Windows
            This example is the same as the previous one, except that it uses the certutil tool instead 
            of base64. This procedure requires two commands, as shown in the following example.
              aws kms encrypt \ 
                  --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
                  --plaintext fileb://ExamplePlaintextFile \ 
                  --output text \ 
                  --query CiphertextBlob > C:\Temp\ExampleEncryptedFile.base64
              certutil -decode C:\Temp\ExampleEncryptedFile.base64 C:\Temp\ExampleEncryptedFile
            Example 3: Encrypting with an asymmetric KMS key
            The following encrypt command shows how to encrypt plaintext with an asymmetric 
            KMS key. The --encryption-algorithm parameter is required. As in all encrypt CLI 
            commands, the plaintext parameter must be base64-encoded, or you must use the
            fileb:// preﬁx, which tells the AWS CLI to read binary data from the ﬁle.
      Actions                                                                                 941

            and a copy of that data key encrypted under the speciﬁed KMS key. You can safely store the 
            encrypted data key with the encrypted data.
            To request a 256-bit data key, use the key-spec parameter with a value of AES_256. To 
            request a 128-bit data key, use the key-spec parameter with a value of AES_128. For all 
            other data key lengths, use the number-of-bytes parameter.
            The KMS key you specify must be a symmetric encryption KMS key, that is, a KMS key with a 
            key spec value of SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT.

            Example 2: To generate a 512-bit symmetric data key
            The following generate-data-key example requests a 512-bit symmetric data key for 
            encryption and decryption. The command returns a plaintext data key for immediate use 
            and deletion, and a copy of that data key encrypted under the speciﬁed KMS key. You can 
            safely store the encrypted data key with the encrypted data.
            To request a key length other than 128 or 256 bits, use the number-of-bytes parameter. 
            To request a 512-bit data key, the following example uses the number-of-bytes
            parameter with a value of 64 (bytes).

            The following generate-data-key-without-plaintext example requests an encrypted 
            copy of a 256-bit symmetric data key for use outside of AWS. You can call AWS KMS to 
            decrypt the data key when you are ready to use it.
            To request a 256-bit data key, use the key-spec parameter with a value of AES_256. To 
            request a 128-bit data key, use the key-spec parameter with a value of AES_128. For all 
            other data key lengths, use the number-of-bytes parameter.
            The KMS key you specify must be a symmetric encryption KMS key, that is, a KMS key with a 
            key spec value of SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT.

         AWS CLI
            Example 1: To generate a 256-bit random byte string (Linux or macOs)
            The following generate-random example generates a 256-bit (32-byte), base64-encoded 
            random byte string. The example decodes the byte string and saves it in the random ﬁle.
            When you run this command, you must use the number-of-bytes parameter to specify the 
            length of the random value in bytes.
            You don't specify a KMS key when you run this command. The random byte string is 
            unrelated to any KMS key.
            By default, AWS KMS generates the random number. However, if you specify a custom key 
            store, the random byte string is generated in the AWS CloudHSM cluster associated with the 
            custom key store.
            This example uses the following parameters and values:
            It uses the required --number-of-bytes parameter with a value of 32 to request a 32-
            byte (256-bit) string.It uses the --output parameter with a value of text to direct the AWS 
            CLI to return the output as text, instead of JSON.It uses the --query parameter to extract 
            the value of the Plaintext property from the response.It pipes ( | ) the output of the 
            command to the base64 utility, which decodes the extracted output.It uses the redirection 
            operator ( > ) to save decoded byte string to the ExampleRandom ﬁle.It uses the redirection 
            operator ( > ) to save the binary ciphertext to a ﬁle.
              aws kms generate-random \ 
                  --number-of-bytes 32 \ 
                  --output text \ 
                  --query Plaintext | base64 --decode > ExampleRandom
            This command produces no output.

            The following example uses the generate-random command to generate a 256-bit (32-
            byte), base64-encoded random byte string. The example decodes the byte string and saves 
            it in the random ﬁle. This example is the same as the previous example, except that it uses 
            the certutil utility in Windows to base64-decode the random byte string before saving it 
            in a ﬁle.
            First, generate a base64-encoded random byte string and saves it in a temporary ﬁle,
            ExampleRandom.base64.
              aws kms generate-random \ 
                  --number-of-bytes 32 \ 
                  --output text \ 
                  --query Plaintext > ExampleRandom.base64
            Because the output of the generate-random command is saved in a ﬁle, this example 
            produces no output.
            Now use the certutil -decode command to decode the base64-encoded byte string 
            in the ExampleRandom.base64 ﬁle. Then, it saves the decoded byte string in the
            ExampleRandom ﬁle.
              certutil -decode ExampleRandom.base64 ExampleRandom
            Output:
              Input Length = 18
              Output Length = 12
              CertUtil: -decode command completed successfully.

         AWS CLI
            To copy a key policy from one KMS key to another KMS key
            The following get-key-policy example gets the key policy from one KMS key and saves 
            it in a text ﬁle. Then, it replaces the policy of a diﬀerent KMS key using the text ﬁle as the 
            policy input.
            Because the --policy parameter of put-key-policy requires a string, you must use the
            --output text option to return the output as a text string instead of JSON.
              aws kms get-key-policy \ 
                  --policy-name default \ 
                  --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
                  --query Policy \ 
                  --output text > policy.txt
              aws kms put-key-policy \

            Example 2: To list all aliases for a particular KMS key
            The following example uses the list-aliases command and its key-id parameter to list 
            all aliases that are associated with a particular KMS key.
            Each alias is associated with only one KMS key, but a KMS key can have multiple aliases. This 
            command is very useful because the AWS KMS console lists only one alias for each KMS key. 
            To ﬁnd all aliases for a KMS key, you must use the list-aliases command.

            This example uses the key ID of the KMS key for the --key-id parameter, but you can use a 
            key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN in this command.

         AWS CLI
            To view the grants on an AWS KMS key
            The following list-grants example displays all of the grants on the speciﬁed AWS 
            managed KMS key for Amazon DynamoDB in your account. This grant allows DynamoDB 
            to use the KMS key on your behalf to encrypt a DynamoDB table before writing it to disk. 
            You can use a command like this one to view the grants on the AWS managed KMS keys and 
            customer managed KMS keys in the AWS account and Region.
            This command uses the key-id parameter with a key ID to identify the KMS key. You can 
            use a key ID or key ARN to identify the KMS key. To get the key ID or key ARN of an AWS 
            managed KMS key, use the list-keys or list-aliases command.
              aws kms list-grants \ 
                  --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
            The output shows that the grant gives Amazon DynamoDB permission to use the KMS key 
            for cryptographic operations, and gives it permission to view details about the KMS key 
            (DescribeKey) and to retire grants (RetireGrant). The EncryptionContextSubset

            constraint limits these permission to requests that include the speciﬁed encryption context 
            pairs. As a result, the permissions in the grant are eﬀective only on speciﬁed account and

      Use ListKeyPolicies with an AWS SDK or CLI
      The following code examples show how to use ListKeyPolicies.
      CLI
         AWS CLI
            To get the names of key policies for a KMS key
            The following list-key-policies example gets the names of the key policies for a 
            customer managed key in the example account and Region. You can use this command to 
            ﬁnd the names of key policies for AWS managed keys and customer managed keys.
            Because the only valid key policy name is default, this command is not useful.
            To specify the KMS key, use the key-id parameter. This example uses a key ID value, but 
            you can use a key ID or key ARN in this command.
              aws kms list-key-policies \ 
                  --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

      Use PutKeyPolicy with an AWS SDK or CLI
      The following code examples show how to use PutKeyPolicy.
      CLI
         AWS CLI
            To change the key policy for a KMS key
            The following put-key-policy example changes the key policy for a customer managed 
            key.
            To begin, create a key policy and save it in a local JSON ﬁle. In this example, the ﬁle is
            key_policy.json. You can also specify the key policy as a string value of the policy
            parameter.
            The ﬁrst statement in this key policy gives the AWS account permission to use IAM policies 
            to control access to the KMS key. The second statement gives the test-user user 
            permission to run the describe-key and list-keys commands on the KMS key.
            Contents of key_policy.json:

                  ]
              }
            To identify the KMS key, this example uses the key ID, but you can also use a key ARN. To 
            specify the key policy, the command uses the policy parameter. To indicate that the policy 
            is in a ﬁle, it uses the required file:// preﬁx. This preﬁx is required to identify ﬁles on all 
            supported operating systems. Finally, the command uses the policy-name parameter with 
            a value of default. If no policy name is speciﬁed, the default value is default. The only 
            valid value is default.

            the get-key-policy command. The following example command gets the key policy for

      Use ReEncrypt with an AWS SDK or CLI
      The following code examples show how to use ReEncrypt.
      CLI
         AWS CLI
            Example 1: To re-encrypt an encrypted message under a diﬀerent symmetric KMS key 
            (Linux and macOS).
            The following re-encrypt command example demonstrates the recommended way to re-
            encrypt data with the AWS CLI.
            Provide the ciphertext in a ﬁle.In the value of the --ciphertext-blob parameter, 
            use the fileb:// preﬁx, which tells the CLI to read the data from a binary ﬁle. If the 
            ﬁle is not in the current directory, type the full path to ﬁle. For more information about 
            reading AWS CLI parameter values from a ﬁle, see Loading AWS CLI parameters from 
            a ﬁle in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide and Best Practices for Local File 
            Parameters in the AWS Command Line Tool Blog.Specify the source KMS key, which decrypts 
            the ciphertext.The --source-key-id parameter is not required when decrypting with 
            symmetric encryption KMS keys. AWS KMS can get the KMS key that was used to encrypt 
            the data from the metadata in the ciphertext blob. But it's always a best practice to specify 
            the KMS key you are using. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend, 
            and prevents you from inadvertently decrypting a ciphertext using a KMS key you do not 
            trust.Specify the destination KMS key, which re-encrypts the data.The --destination-
            key-id parameter is always required. This example uses a key ARN, but you can use any 
            valid key identiﬁer.Request the plaintext output as a text value.The --query parameter 
            tells the CLI to get only the value of the Plaintext ﬁeld from the output. The --output
            parameter returns the output as text.Base64-decode the plaintext and save it in a ﬁle.The 
            following example pipes (|) the value of the Plaintext parameter to the Base64 utility, 
            which decodes it. Then, it redirects (>) the decoded output to the ExamplePlaintext ﬁle.
            Before running this command, replace the example key IDs with valid key identiﬁers from 
            your AWS account.
              aws kms re-encrypt \ 
                  --ciphertext-blob fileb://ExampleEncryptedFile \ 
                  --source-key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
      Actions                                                                                 992

                  --destination-key-id 0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321 \ 
                  --query CiphertextBlob \ 
                  --output text | base64 --decode > ExampleReEncryptedFile
            This command produces no output. The output from the re-encrypt command is base64-
            decoded and saved in a ﬁle.
            For more information, see ReEncrypt in the AWS Key Management Service API Reference.
            Example 2: To re-encrypt an encrypted message under a diﬀerent symmetric KMS key 
            (Windows command prompt).
            The following re-encrypt command example is the same as the previous one except that 
            it uses the certutil utility to Base64-decode the plaintext data. This procedure requires 
            two commands, as shown in the following examples.
            Before running this command, replace the example key ID with a valid key ID from your AWS 
            account.
              aws kms re-encrypt ^
                  --ciphertext-blob fileb://ExampleEncryptedFile ^
                  --source-key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab ^
                  --destination-key-id 0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321 ^
                  --query CiphertextBlob ^
                  --output text > ExampleReEncryptedFile.base64
            Then use the certutil utility
              certutil -decode ExamplePlaintextFile.base64 ExamplePlaintextFile
            Output:
              Input Length = 18
              Output Length = 12
              CertUtil: -decode command completed successfully.

      Use ScheduleKeyDeletion with an AWS SDK or CLI
      The following code examples show how to use ScheduleKeyDeletion.
      Action examples are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. You can see 
      this action in context in the following code example:

         AWS CLI
            To schedule the deletion of a customer managed KMS key.
            The following schedule-key-deletion example schedules the speciﬁed customer 
            managed KMS key to be deleted in 15 days.
            The --key-id parameter identiﬁes the KMS key. This example uses a key ARN value, but 
            you can use either the key ID or the ARN of the KMS key.The --pending-window-in-days
            parameter speciﬁes the length of the 7-30 day waiting period. By default, the waiting period 
            is 30 days. This example speciﬁes a value of 15, which tells AWS to permanently delete the 
            KMS key 15 days after the command completes.

      CLI
         AWS CLI
            Example 1: To generate a digital signature for a message
            The following sign example generates a cryptographic signature for a short message. The 
            output of the command includes a base-64 encoded Signature ﬁeld that you can verify by 
            using the verify command.
            You must specify a message to sign and a signing algorithm that your asymmetric KMS 
            key supports. To get the signing algorithms for your KMS key, use the describe-key
            command.
            In AWS CLI v2, the value of the message parameter must be Base64-encoded. Or, you can 
            save the message in a ﬁle and use the fileb:// preﬁx, which tells the AWS CLI to read 
            binary data from the ﬁle.
            Before running this command, replace the example key ID with a valid key ID from your 
            AWS account. The key ID must represent an asymmetric KMS key with a key usage of 
            SIGN_VERIFY.

            in AWS KMS in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
            Example 2: To save a digital signature in a ﬁle (Linux and macOs)
            The following sign example generates a cryptographic signature for a short message stored 
            in a local ﬁle. The command also gets the Signature property from the response, Base64-
            decodes it and saves it in the ExampleSignature ﬁle. You can use the signature ﬁle in a
            verify command that veriﬁes the signature.
            The sign command requires a Base64-encoded message and a signing algorithm that your 
            asymmetric KMS key supports. To get the signing algorithms that your KMS key supports, 
            use the describe-key command.
            Before running this command, replace the example key ID with a valid key ID from your 
            AWS account. The key ID must represent an asymmetric KMS key with a key usage of 
            SIGN_VERIFY.

      Use TagResource with an AWS SDK or CLI
      The following code examples show how to use TagResource.
      Action examples are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. You can see 
      this action in context in the following code example:

      CLI
         AWS CLI
            To add a tag to a KMS key
            The following tag-resource example adds "Purpose":"Test" and "Dept":"IT" tags 
            to a customer managed KMS key. You can use tags like these to label KMS keys and create 
            categories of KMS keys for permissions and auditing.
            To specify the KMS key, use the key-id parameter. This example uses a key ID value, but 
            you can use a key ID or key ARN in this command.
              aws kms tag-resource \ 
                  --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \ 
                  --tags TagKey='Purpose',TagValue='Test' TagKey='Dept',TagValue='IT'
            This command produces no output. To view the tags on an AWS KMS KMS key, use the
            list-resource-tags command.

      Use UpdateAlias with an AWS SDK or CLI
      The following code examples show how to use UpdateAlias.
      CLI
         AWS CLI
            To associate an alias with a diﬀerent KMS key
            The following update-alias example associates the alias alias/test-key with a 
            diﬀerent KMS key.
            The --alias-name parameter speciﬁes the alias. The alias name value must begin with
            alias/.The --target-key-id parameter speciﬁes the KMS key to associate with the alias. 
            You don't need to specify the current KMS key for the alias.
              aws kms update-alias \ 
                  --alias-name alias/test-key \ 
                  --target-key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
            This command produces no output. To ﬁnd the alias, use the list-aliases command.

            Guide.

      Use Verify with an AWS SDK or CLI
      The following code examples show how to use Verify.
      CLI
         AWS CLI
            To verify a digital signature
            The following verify command veriﬁes a cryptographic signature for a short, Base64-
            encoded message. The key ID, message, message type, and signing algorithm must be same 
            ones that were used to sign the message.
            In AWS CLI v2, the value of the message parameter must be Base64-encoded. Or, you can 
            save the message in a ﬁle and use the fileb:// preﬁx, which tells the AWS CLI to read 
            binary data from the ﬁle.
            The signature that you specify cannot be base64-encoded. For help decoding the signature 
            that the sign command returns, see the sign command examples.
      Actions                                                                                1021

            The output of the command includes a Boolean SignatureValid ﬁeld that indicates that 
            the signature was veriﬁed. If the signature validation fails, the verify command fails, too.
            Before running this command, replace the example key ID with a valid key ID from your AWS 
            account.
              aws kms verify \ 
                  --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \

                  --message-type RAW \ 
                  --signing-algorithm RSASSA_PKCS1_V1_5_SHA_256 \ 
                  --signature fileb://ExampleSignature

              {

      Cryptographic attestation for AWS Nitro Enclaves
      AWS KMS supports cryptographic attestation for AWS Nitro Enclaves. Applications that support 
      AWS Nitro Enclaves call the following AWS KMS cryptographic operations with a signed attestation 
      document for the enclave. These AWS KMS APIs verify that the attestation document came from 
      a Nitro enclave. Then, instead of returning plaintext data in the response, these APIs encrypt the 
      plaintext with the public key from the attestation document and return ciphertext that can be 
      decrypted only by the corresponding private key in the enclave.

      How to call AWS KMS APIs for a Nitro enclave
      To call AWS KMS APIs for a Nitro enclave, use the Recipient parameter in the request to provide 
      the signed attestation document for the enclave and the encryption algorithm to use with the 
      enclave's public key. When a request includes the Recipient parameter with a signed attestation 
      How to call AWS KMS APIs for a Nitro enclave                                           1028
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      document, the response includes a CiphertextForRecipient ﬁeld with the ciphertext 
      encrypted by the public key. The plaintext ﬁeld is null or empty.
      The Recipient parameter must specify a signed attestation document from an AWS Nitro 
      enclave. AWS KMS relies on the digital signature for the enclave’s attestation document to 
      prove that the public key in the request came from a valid enclave. You cannot supply your own 
      certiﬁcate to digitally sign the attestation document.
      To specify the Recipient parameter, use the AWS Nitro Enclaves SDK or any AWS SDK. The 
      AWS Nitro Enclaves SDK, which is supported only within a Nitro enclave, automatically adds the
      Recipient parameter and its values to every AWS KMS request. To make requests for Nitro 
      enclaves in the AWS SDKs, you have to specify the Recipient parameter and its values. Support 
      for Nitro enclave cryptographic attestation in the AWS SDKs was introduced in March 2023.
      AWS KMS supports policy condition keys that you can use to allow or deny enclave operations with 
      an AWS KMS key based on the content of the attestation document. You can also monitor requests 
      to AWS KMS for your Nitro enclave in your AWS CloudTrail logs.
      For detailed information about the Recipient parameter and the AWS
      CiphertextForRecipient response ﬁeld, see the Decrypt, DeriveSharedSecret,
      GenerateDataKey, GenerateDataKeyPair, and GenerateRandom topics in the AWS Key Management 
      Service API Reference, the AWS Nitro Enclaves SDK, or any AWS SDK. For information about setting 
      up your data and data keys for encryption, see Using cryptographic attestation with AWS KMS.
      Monitoring requests for Nitro enclaves
      You can use your AWS CloudTrail logs to monitor Decrypt, DeriveSharedSecret,
      GenerateDataKey, GenerateDataKeyPair, and GenerateRandom operations for an 
      AWS Nitro enclave. In these log entries, the additionalEventData ﬁeld has a
      recipient ﬁeld with the module ID (attestationDocumentModuleId), image digest 
      (attestationDocumentEnclaveImageDigest), and platform conﬁguration registers (PCRs) 
      from the attestation document in the request. These ﬁelds are included only when the Recipient
      parameter in the request speciﬁes a signed attestation document from an AWS Nitro enclave.
      The module ID is the enclave ID of the Nitro enclave. The image digest is the SHA384 hash of the 
      enclave image. You can use the image digest and PCR values in conditions for key policies and IAM 
      policies. For information about the PCRs, see Where to get an enclave's measurements in the AWS 
      Nitro Enclaves User Guide.

      Using AWS KMS encryption with AWS services
      With AWS Key Management Service, you can provide encryption keys for protecting data in 
      other AWS services. Using AWS KMS encryption with AWS services refers to the process of 
      integrating AWS KMS with other AWS services to encrypt and decrypt data at rest or in transit. 
      Developers, system administrators, and security professionals might be interested in this topic to 
      secure sensitive data stored or transmitted through AWS services, meet regulatory compliance 
      requirements, or implement encryption best practices. Common use cases include encrypting 
      Amazon EBS volumes, Amazon S3 buckets, and Amazon RDS databases. The following sections 
      will cover the steps to conﬁgure and manage AWS KMS encryption keys for speciﬁc AWS services, 
      ensuring data conﬁdentiality and integrity across your AWS environment.For the complete list of 
      AWS services integrated with AWS KMS, see AWS Service Integration.
      The following topics discuss in detail how particular services use AWS KMS, including the KMS keys 
      they support, how they manage data keys, the permissions they require, and how to track each 
      service's use of the KMS keys in your account.
           Important
           AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS use only symmetric encryption KMS keys 
           to encrypt your data. These services do not support encryption with asymmetric KMS keys. 
           For help determining whether a KMS key is symmetric or asymmetric, see Identify diﬀerent 
           key types.

      Amazon EBS encryption
      When you attach an encrypted Amazon EBS volume to a supported Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud 
      (Amazon EC2) instance type, data stored at rest on the volume, disk I/O, and snapshots created 
      from the volume are all encrypted. The encryption occurs on the servers that host Amazon EC2 
      instances.
      This feature is supported on all Amazon EBS volume types. You access encrypted volumes the 
      same way you access other volumes; encryption and decryption are handled transparently and 
      they require no additional action from you, your EC2 instance, or your application. Snapshots of 
      encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted, and volumes that are created from encrypted 
      snapshots are also automatically encrypted.
      The encryption status of an EBS volume is determined when you create the volume. You cannot 
      change the encryption status of an existing volume. However, you can migrate data between 
      encrypted and unencrypted volumes and apply a new encryption status while copying a snapshot.
      Amazon EBS supports optional encryption by default. You can enable encryption automatically 
      on all new EBS volumes and snapshot copies in your AWS account and Region. This conﬁguration 
      setting doesn't aﬀect existing volumes or snapshots. For details, see Amazon EBS encryption in the
      Amazon EBS User Guide.
      Using KMS keys and data keys
      When you create an encrypted Amazon EBS volume, you specify an AWS KMS key. By default, 
      Amazon EBS uses the AWS managed key for Amazon EBS in your account (aws/ebs). However, you 
      can specify a customer managed key that you create and manage.
      To use a customer managed key, you must give Amazon EBS permission to use the KMS key on 
      your behalf. For a list of required permissions, see Permissions for IAM users in the Amazon EC2 
      User Guide or Amazon EC2 User Guide.

      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
           Important
           Amazon EBS supports only symmetric KMS keys. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key to 
           encrypt an Amazon EBS volume. For help determining whether a KMS key is symmetric or 
           asymmetric, see Identify diﬀerent key types.
      For each volume, Amazon EBS asks AWS KMS to generate a unique data key encrypted under the 
      KMS key that you specify. Amazon EBS stores the encrypted data key with the volume. Then, when 
      you attach the volume to an Amazon EC2 instance, Amazon EBS calls AWS KMS to decrypt the data 
      key. Amazon EBS uses the plaintext data key in hypervisor memory to encrypt all disk I/O to the 
      volume. For details, see How EBS encryption works in the Amazon EC2 User Guide or Amazon EC2 
      User Guide.
      Amazon EBS encryption context
      In its GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext and Decrypt requests to AWS KMS, Amazon EBS uses an 
      encryption context with a name-value pair that identiﬁes the volume or snapshot in the request. 
      The name in the encryption context does not vary.
      An encryption context is a set of key–value pairs that contain arbitrary nonsecret data. When you 
      include an encryption context in a request to encrypt data, AWS KMS cryptographically binds 
      the encryption context to the encrypted data. To decrypt the data, you must pass in the same 
      encryption context.
      For all volumes and for encrypted snapshots created with the Amazon EBS CreateSnapshot
      operation, Amazon EBS uses the volume ID as encryption context value. In the
      requestParameters ﬁeld of a CloudTrail log entry, the encryption context looks similar to the 
      following:
        "encryptionContext": { 
           "aws:ebs:id": "vol-0cfb133e847d28be9"
        }
      For encrypted snapshots created with the Amazon EC2 CopySnapshot operation, Amazon EBS uses 
      the snapshot ID as encryption context value. In the requestParameters ﬁeld of a CloudTrail log 
      entry, the encryption context looks similar to the following:
        "encryptionContext": { 
      Amazon EBS encryption context                                                          1037

          "aws:ebs:id": "snap-069a655b568de654f"
        }
      Detecting Amazon EBS failures
      To create an encrypted EBS volume or attach the volume to an EC2 instance, Amazon EBS and the 
      Amazon EC2 infrastructure must be able to use the KMS key that you speciﬁed for EBS volume 
      encryption. When the KMS key is not usable—for example, when its key state is not Enabled —the 
      volume creation or volume attachment fails.
      In this case, Amazon EBS sends an event to Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) to 
      notify you about the failure. In EventBridge, you can establish rules that trigger automatic actions 
      in response to these events. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Events for Amazon 
      EBS in the Amazon EC2 User Guide, especially the following sections:
      • Invalid Encryption Key on Volume Attach or Reattach
      • Invalid Encryption Key on Create Volume
      To ﬁx these failures, ensure that the KMS key that you speciﬁed for EBS volume encryption is 
      enabled. To do this, ﬁrst view the KMS key to determine its current key state (the Status column in 
      the AWS Management Console). Then, see the information at one of the following links:
      • If the KMS key's key state is disabled, enable it.
      • If the KMS key's key state is pending import, import key material.
      • If the KMS key's key state is pending deletion, cancel key deletion.
      Using AWS CloudFormation to create encrypted Amazon EBS volumes
      You can use AWS CloudFormation to create encrypted Amazon EBS volumes. For more information, 
      see AWS::EC2::Volume in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
      How Amazon EMR uses AWS KMS
      When you use an Amazon EMR cluster, you can conﬁgure the cluster to encrypt data at rest before 
      saving it to a persistent storage location. You can encrypt data at rest on the EMR File System 
      (EMRFS), on the storage volumes of cluster nodes, or both. To encrypt data at rest, you can use an

      AWS KMS key. The following topics explain how an Amazon EMR cluster uses a KMS key to encrypt 
      data at rest.
           Important
           Amazon EMR supports only symmetric KMS keys. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key
           to encrypt data at rest in an Amazon EMR cluster. For help determining whether a KMS key 
           is symmetric or asymmetric, see Identify diﬀerent key types.
      Amazon EMR clusters also encrypt data in transit, which means the cluster encrypts data before 
      sending it through the network. You cannot use a KMS key to encrypt data in transit. For more 
      information, see In-Transit Data Encryption in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.

      Encrypting data on the EMR ﬁle system (EMRFS)
      Amazon EMR clusters use two distributed ﬁles systems:
      • The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). HDFS encryption does not use a KMS key in AWS 
        KMS.
      • The EMR File System (EMRFS). EMRFS is an implementation of HDFS that allows Amazon EMR 
        clusters to store data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). EMRFS supports four 
        encryption options, two of which use a KMS key in AWS KMS. For more information about all 
        four of the EMRFS encryption options, see Encryption Options in the Amazon EMR Management 
        Guide.
      The two EMRFS encryption options that use a KMS key use the following encryption features 
      oﬀered by Amazon S3:

      AWS Key Management Service                                          Developer Guide
      • Protecting data using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS). The 
       Amazon EMR cluster sends data to Amazon S3. Amazon S3 uses a KMS key to encrypt the data 
       before saving it to an S3 bucket. For more information about how this works, see Process for 
       encrypting data on EMRFS with SSE-KMS.
      • Protecting data using client-side encryption (CSE-KMS). Data in an Amazon EMR is encrypted 
       under an AWS KMS key before it's sent to Amazon S3 for storage. For more information about 
       how this works, see Process for encrypting data on EMRFS with CSE-KMS.
      When you conﬁgure an Amazon EMR cluster to encrypt data on EMRFS with a KMS key, you choose 
      the KMS key that you want Amazon S3 or the Amazon EMR cluster to use. With SSE-KMS, you 
      can choose the AWS managed key for Amazon S3 with the alias aws/s3, or a symmetric customer 
      managed key that you create. With client-side encryption, you must choose a symmetric customer 
      managed key that you create. When you choose a customer managed key, you must ensure that 
      your Amazon EMR cluster has permission to use the KMS key. For more information, see Using AWS 
      KMS keys for encryption in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
      For both server-side and client-side encryption, the KMS key you choose is the root key in an
      envelope encryption workﬂow. The data is encrypted with a unique data key that is encrypted 
      under the KMS key in AWS KMS. The encrypted data and an encrypted copy of its data key are 
      stored together as a single encrypted object in an S3 bucket. For more information about how this 
      works, see the following topics.

      Process for encrypting data on EMRFS with SSE-KMS
      When you conﬁgure an Amazon EMR cluster to use SSE-KMS, the encryption process works like 
      this:
      1. The cluster sends data to Amazon S3 for storage in an S3 bucket.
      2. Amazon S3 sends a GenerateDataKey request to AWS KMS, specifying the key ID of the KMS 
        key that you chose when you conﬁgured the cluster to use SSE-KMS. The request includes 
        encryption context; for more information, see Encryption context.

      3. AWS KMS generates a unique data encryption key (data key) and then sends two copies of this 
        data key to Amazon S3. One copy is unencrypted (plaintext), and the other copy is encrypted 
        under the KMS key.
      4. Amazon S3 uses the plaintext data key to encrypt the data that it received in step 1, and then 
        removes the plaintext data key from memory as soon as possible after use.
      5. Amazon S3 stores the encrypted data and the encrypted copy of the data key together as a 
        single encrypted object in an S3 bucket.
      The decryption process works like this:
      1. The cluster requests an encrypted data object from an S3 bucket.
      2. Amazon S3 extracts the encrypted data key from the S3 object, and then sends the encrypted 
        data key to AWS KMS with a Decrypt request. The request includes an encryption context.
      3. AWS KMS decrypts the encrypted data key using the same KMS key that was used to encrypt it, 
        and then sends the decrypted (plaintext) data key to Amazon S3.
      4. Amazon S3 uses the plaintext data key to decrypt the encrypted data, and then removes the 
        plaintext data key from memory as soon as possible after use.
      5. Amazon S3 sends the decrypted data to the cluster.
      Process for encrypting data on EMRFS with CSE-KMS
      When you conﬁgure an Amazon EMR cluster to use CSE-KMS, the encryption process works like 
      this:
      1. When it's ready to store data in Amazon S3, the cluster sends a GenerateDataKey request to 
        AWS KMS, specifying the key ID of the KMS key that you chose when you conﬁgured the cluster 
        to use CSE-KMS. The request includes encryption context; for more information, see Encryption 
        context.
      2. AWS KMS generates a unique data encryption key (data key) and then sends two copies of this 
        data key to the cluster. One copy is unencrypted (plaintext), and the other copy is encrypted 
        under the KMS key.
      3. The cluster uses the plaintext data key to encrypt the data, and then removes the plaintext data 
        key from memory as soon as possible after use.
      4. The cluster combines the encrypted data and the encrypted copy of the data key together into a 
        single encrypted object.

      5. The cluster sends the encrypted object to Amazon S3 for storage.
      The decryption process works like this:
      1. The cluster requests the encrypted data object from an S3 bucket.
      2. Amazon S3 sends the encrypted object to the cluster.
      3. The cluster extracts the encrypted data key from the encrypted object, and then sends the 
         encrypted data key to AWS KMS with a Decrypt request. The request includes encryption 
         context.
      4. AWS KMS decrypts the encrypted data key using the same KMS key that was used to encrypt it, 
         and then sends the decrypted (plaintext) data key to the cluster.
      5. The cluster uses the plaintext data key to decrypt the encrypted data, and then removes the 
         plaintext data key from memory as soon as possible after use.
      Encrypting data on the storage volumes of cluster nodes
      An Amazon EMR cluster is a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. 
      Each instance in the cluster is called a cluster node or node. Each node can have two types of 
      storage volumes: instance store volumes, and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. 
      You can conﬁgure the cluster to use Linux Uniﬁed Key Setup (LUKS) to encrypt both types of 
      storage volumes on the nodes (but not the boot volume of each node). This is called local disk 
      encryption.
      When you enable local disk encryption for a cluster, you can choose to encrypt the LUKS key with 
      a KMS key in AWS KMS. You must choose a customer managed key that you create; you cannot use 
      an AWS managed key. If you choose a customer managed key, you must ensure that your Amazon 
      EMR cluster has permission to use the KMS key. For more information, see Using AWS KMS keys for 
      encryption in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
      When you enable local disk encryption using a KMS key, the encryption process works like this:
      1. When each cluster node launches, it sends a GenerateDataKey request to AWS KMS, specifying 
         the key ID of the KMS key that you chose when you enabled local disk encryption for the cluster.
      2. AWS KMS generates a unique data encryption key (data key) and then sends two copies of this

      3. The node uses a base64-encoded version of the plaintext data key as the password that protects 
         the LUKS key. The node saves the encrypted copy of the data key on its boot volume.
      4. If the node reboots, the rebooted node sends the encrypted data key to AWS KMS with a
         Decrypt request.
      5. AWS KMS decrypts the encrypted data key using the same KMS key that was used to encrypt it, 
         and then sends the decrypted (plaintext) data key to the node.
      6. The node uses the base64-encoded version of the plaintext data key as the password to unlock 
         the LUKS key.
      Encryption context
      Each AWS service integrated with AWS KMS can specify an encryption context when the service 
      uses AWS KMS to generate data keys or to encrypt or decrypt data. Encryption context is additional 
      authenticated information that AWS KMS uses to check for data integrity. When a service speciﬁes 
      encryption context for an encryption operation, it must specify the same encryption context for 
      the corresponding decryption operation or decryption will fail. Encryption context is also written to 
      AWS CloudTrail log ﬁles, which can help you understand why a speciﬁc KMS key was used.
      The following section explain the encryption context that is used in each Amazon EMR encryption 
      scenario that uses a KMS key.
      Encryption context for EMRFS encryption with SSE-KMS
      With SSE-KMS, the Amazon EMR cluster sends data to Amazon S3, and then Amazon S3 
      uses a KMS key to encrypt the data before saving it to an S3 bucket. In this case, Amazon 
      S3 uses the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 object as encryption context with each
      GenerateDataKey and Decrypt request that it sends to AWS KMS. The following example shows a 
      JSON representation of the encryption context that Amazon S3 uses.
        { "aws:s3:arn" : "arn:aws:s3:::S3_bucket_name/S3_object_key" }
      Encryption context for EMRFS encryption with CSE-KMS
      With CSE-KMS, the Amazon EMR cluster uses a KMS key to encrypt data before sending it to 
      Amazon S3 for storage. In this case, the cluster uses the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the 
      KMS key as encryption context with each GenerateDataKey and Decrypt request that it sends to 
      Encryption context                                                                     1043

      cluster uses.

      Encryption context for local disk encryption with LUKS
      When an Amazon EMR cluster uses local disk encryption with LUKS, the cluster nodes do not 
      specify encryption context with the GenerateDataKey and Decrypt requests that they send to AWS 
      KMS.
      How Amazon Redshift uses AWS KMS
      This topic discusses how Amazon Redshift uses AWS KMS to encrypt data.

      Amazon Redshift encryption
      An Amazon Redshift data warehouse is a collection of computing resources called nodes, which are 
      organized into a group called a cluster. Each cluster runs an Amazon Redshift engine and contains 
      one or more databases.
      Amazon Redshift uses a four-tier, key-based architecture for encryption. The architecture consists 
      of data encryption keys, a database key, a cluster key, and a root key. You can use an AWS KMS key 
      as the root key.
      Data encryption keys encrypt data blocks in the cluster. Each data block is assigned a randomly-
      generated AES-256 key. These keys are encrypted by using the database key for the cluster.
      The database key encrypts data encryption keys in the cluster. The database key is a randomly-
      generated AES-256 key. It is stored on disk in a separate network from the Amazon Redshift cluster 
      and passed to the cluster across a secure channel.
      Amazon Redshift                                                                        1044
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      The cluster key encrypts the database key for the Amazon Redshift cluster. You can use AWS KMS, 
      AWS CloudHSM, or an external hardware security module (HSM) to manage the cluster key. See the
      Amazon Redshift Database Encryption  documentation for more details.
      You can request encryption by checking the appropriate box in the Amazon Redshift console. 
      You can specify a customer managed key by choosing one from the list that appears below the 
      encryption box. If you do not specify a customer managed key, Amazon Redshift uses the AWS 
      managed key for Amazon Redshift under your account.
           Important
           Amazon Redshift supports only symmetric encryption KMS keys. You cannot use an 
           asymmetric KMS key in an Amazon Redshift encryption workﬂow. For help determining 
           whether a KMS key is symmetric or asymmetric, see Identify diﬀerent key types.
      Encryption context
      Each service that is integrated with AWS KMS speciﬁes an encryption context when requesting data 
      keys, encrypting, and decrypting. The encryption context is additional authenticated data (AAD) 
      that AWS KMS uses to check for data integrity. That is, when an encryption context is speciﬁed for 
      an encryption operation, the service also speciﬁes it for the decryption operation or decryption will 
      not succeed. Amazon Redshift uses the cluster ID and the creation time for the encryption context. 
      In the requestParameters ﬁeld of a CloudTrail log ﬁle, the encryption context will look similar 
      to this.
        "encryptionContext": { 
            "aws:redshift:arn": "arn:aws:redshift:region:account_ID:cluster:cluster_name", 
            "aws:redshift:createtime": "20150206T1832Z"
        },    
      You can search on the cluster name in your CloudTrail logs to understand what operations were 
      performed by using an AWS KMS key (KMS key). The operations include cluster encryption, cluster 
      decryption, and generating data keys.

      Key states of AWS KMS keys
      An AWS KMS key always has a key state. Operations on the KMS key and its environment can 
      change the key state. The key state can change either transiently, or until another operation 
      changes its key state. These operations are done either asynchronously, or by an API call.
      The table in this section shows how key states aﬀect calls to AWS KMS API operations. As a result 
      of its key state, an operation on a KMS key is expected to succeed (#), fail (X), or succeed only under 
      certain conditions (?). The result often diﬀers for KMS keys with imported key material.
      This table includes only the API operations that use an existing KMS key. Other operations, such as
      CreateKey and ListKeys, are omitted.

      • Key state table
      Key states and KMS key types
      The type of the KMS key determines the key states it can have.
      •
        All KMS keys can be in the Enabled, Disabled, and PendingDeletion states.
      •
        Most KMS keys are created in the Enabled state. Keys with imported key material are created in 
        the PendingImport state.
      •
        The PendingImport state applies only to KMS keys with imported key material. When any key 
        material for an imported key is deleted or it expires, then the state changes from Enabled to
        PendingImport.
      •
        The Unavailable state applies only to a KMS key in a custom key store. A KMS key in an AWS 
        CloudHSM key store is Unavailable when the custom key store is intentionally disconnected 
        from its AWS CloudHSM cluster. A KMS key in an external key store is Unavailable when the 
        custom key store is intentionally disconnected from its external key store proxy. You can view 
        and manage unavailable KMS keys, but you cannot use them in cryptographic operations.
        The key state of a KMS key in a custom key store is not aﬀected by changes to its backing key. A 
        KMS key in a AWS CloudHSM key store is not aﬀected by changes to its associated key material
        in the AWS CloudHSM cluster. A KMS key in an external key store is not aﬀected by changes to 
      Key state reference                                                                   1047

        its external key in an external key manager. If the backing key is disabled or deleted, the KMS key 
        state doesn't change, but cryptographic operations using the KMS key fail.
      •
        The Creating, Updating, and PendingReplicaDeletion key states apply only to multi-
        Region keys.
        •
          A multi-Region replica key is in the transient Creating key state while it is being created. 
          This process might still be in progress when the ReplicateKey operation completes. When the 
          replicate process completes, the replica key is in the Enabled or PendingImport state.
        •
          Multi-Region keys are in the transient Updating key state while the primary Region is being 
          updated. This process might still be in progress when the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation 
          completes. When the update process completes, the primary and replica keys resume the
          Enabled key state.
        • When you schedule deletion of a multi-Region primary key that has replica keys, the primary 
          key is in the PendingReplicaDeletion state until all of its replica keys are deleted. Then its 
          key state changes to PendingDeletion. For details, see Deleting multi-Region keys.

      •
        [6] UnsupportedOperationException: <key ARN> origin is EXTERNAL which is 
        not valid for this operation.
      •
        [7] If the KMS key is in a custom key store: UnsupportedOperationException.
      •
        [8] If the KMS key has imported key material: KMSInvalidStateException
      •
        [9] If the KMS key cannot have imported key material: UnsupportedOperationException.
      • [10] If the source KMS key is pending deletion, the command succeeds. If the destination KMS 
        key is pending deletion, the command fails with error: KMSInvalidStateException : <key 
        ARN> is pending deletion.
      •
        [11] KMSInvalidStateException: <key ARN> is unavailable. You cannot perform 
        this operation on an unavailable KMS key.
      • [12] The operation succeeds, but the key state of the KMS key does not change until it becomes 
        available.
      • [13] While a KMS key in a custom key store is pending deletion, its key state remains
        PendingDeletion even if the KMS key becomes unavailable. This allows you to cancel deletion 
        of the KMS key at any time during the waiting period.
      •
        [14] KMSInvalidStateException: <key ARN> is creating. AWS KMS throws this 
        exception while it is replicating a multi-Region key (ReplicateKey).
      •
        [15] KMSInvalidStateException: <key ARN> is updating. AWS KMS 
        throws this exception while it is updating the primary Region of a multi-Region key 
        (UpdatePrimaryRegion).
      Key type reference
      AWS KMS supports diﬀerent features for diﬀerent types of KMS keys. For example, you can only 
      use symmetric encryption KMS keys to generate symmetric data keys and asymmetric data key 
      pairs. Also, importing key material and automatic key rotation are supported only for symmetric 
      encryption KMS keys, and you can create only symmetric encryption KMS keys in a custom key 
      store.
      This reference includes two tables.
      • The Key type table lists the AWS KMS operations that are valid for symmetric encryption KMS 
        keys, asymmetric KMS keys, and HMAC KMS keys.
      • The Special features table lists the AWS KMS operations that are valid for multi-Region KMS 
        keys, KMS keys with imported key material, and KMS keys in custom key stores.

      • Multi-Region keys:
        • Multi-Region keys can be symmetric encryption KMS keys, asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS 
          keys, and KMS keys with imported key material.
        • You cannot create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.
      • Imported key material
        • You can import key material for symmetric encryption KMS keys, asymmetric KMS keys, and 
          HMAC KMS keys.
        • You can create multi-Region keys with imported key material.
        • You cannot create keys with imported key material in a custom key store.
        •
          Automatic key rotation (EnableKeyRotation, DisableKeyRotation) is not supported for 
          KMS keys with imported key material.
        •
          On-demand key rotation (RotateKeyOnDemand) is supported for single-Region, symmetric 
          encryption KMS keys with imported key material.
      • Custom key stores
        • Custom key stores support only symmetric encryption KMS keys.
        •
          Symmetric operations on asymmetric key pairs (GenerateDataKeyPair,
          GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext) are not supported on KMS keys in custom key 
          stores.
        •
          Automatic key rotation (EnableKeyRotation, DisableKeyRotation) is not supported on 
          KMS keys in custom key stores.

       Key spec reference
       When you create an asymmetric KMS key or an HMAC KMS key, you select its key spec. The key 
       spec, which is a property of every AWS KMS key, represents the cryptographic conﬁguration of 
       your KMS key. You choose the key spec when you create the KMS key, and you cannot change it. If 
       you've selected the wrong key spec, delete the KMS key, and create a new one.
            Note
            The key spec for a KMS key was known as a "customer master key spec." The
            CustomerMasterKeySpec parameter of the CreateKey operation is deprecated. Instead, 
            use the KeySpec parameter. The response of the CreateKey and DescribeKey operations 
            includes a KeySpec and CustomerMasterKeySpec member with the same value.
       The key spec determines whether the KMS key is symmetric or asymmetric, the type of key 
       material in the KMS key, and the encryption algorithms, signing algorithms, or message 
       authentication code (MAC) algorithms that AWS KMS supports for the KMS key. The key spec 
       Key spec reference                                                                      1071

      that you choose is typically determined by your use case and regulatory requirements. However, 
      cryptographic operations on KMS keys with diﬀerent key specs are priced diﬀerently and are 
      subject to diﬀerent quotas. For pricing details, see AWS Key Management Service Pricing. For 
      information about request quotas, see Request quotas.
      To limit the key specs that principals can use when creating KMS keys, use the kms:KeySpec
      condition key. You can also use the kms:KeySpec condition key to allow principals to call AWS 
      KMS operations only on KMS keys with a particular key spec. For example, you can deny permission 
      to schedule deletion of any KMS key with an RSA_4096 key spec.
      AWS KMS supports the following key specs for KMS keys:
      Symmetric encryption key spec (default)
         • SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT

      SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT key spec
      The default key spec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, is the key spec for symmetric encryption KMS keys. 
      When you select the Symmetric key type and the Encrypt and decrypt key usage in the AWS KMS 
      console, it selects the SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT key spec. In the CreateKey operation, if you don't 
      specify a KeySpec value, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT is selected. If you don't have a reason to use a 
      diﬀerent key spec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT is a good choice.
      SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT represents AES-256-GCM, a symmetric algorithm based on Advanced 
      Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) with 256-bit keys, an industry 
      standard for secure encryption. The ciphertext that this algorithm generates supports additional 
      authenticated data (AAD), such as an encryption context, and GCM provides an additional integrity 
      check on the ciphertext.
      Data encrypted under AES-256-GCM is protected now and in the future. Cryptographers consider 
      this algorithm to be quantum resistant. Theoretical future, large-scale quantum computing attacks 
      on ciphertexts created under 256-bit AES-GCM keys reduce the eﬀective security of the key to 
      128 bits. But, this security level is suﬃcient to make brute force attacks on AWS KMS ciphertexts 
      infeasible.
      The only exception in China Regions, where SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT represents a 128-bit symmetric 
      key that uses SM4 encryption. You can only create a 128-bit SM4 key within China Regions. You 
      cannot create a 256-bit AES-GCM KMS key in China Regions.
      You can use a symmetric encryption KMS key in AWS KMS to encrypt, decrypt, and re-encrypt data, 
      and to protect generated data keys and data key pairs. AWS services that are integrated with AWS 
      KMS use symmetric encryption KMS keys to encrypt your data at rest. You can import your own 
      key material into a symmetric encryption KMS key and create symmetric encryption KMS keys in
      custom key stores. For a table comparing the operations that you can perform on symmetric and 
      asymmetric KMS keys, see Comparing Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys.
      You can use a symmetric encryption KMS key in AWS KMS to encrypt, decrypt, and re-encrypt data, 
      and generate data keys and data key pairs. You can create multi-Region symmetric encryption KMS

      encryption KMS keys in custom key stores. For a table comparing the operations that you can 
      perform on KMS keys of diﬀerent types, see Key type reference.
      RSA key specs
      When you use an RSA key spec, AWS KMS creates an asymmetric KMS key with an RSA key pair. The 
      private key never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. You can use the public key within AWS KMS, or 
      download the public key for use outside of AWS KMS.
          Warning
          When you encrypt data outside of AWS KMS, be sure that you can decrypt your ciphertext. 
          If you use the public key from a KMS key that has been deleted from AWS KMS, the public 
          key from a KMS key conﬁgured for signing and veriﬁcation, or an encryption algorithm that 
          is not supported by the KMS key, the data is unrecoverable.
      In AWS KMS, you can use asymmetric KMS keys with RSA key pairs for encryption and decryption, 
      or signing and veriﬁcation, but not both. This property, known as key usage, is determined 
      separately from the key spec, but you should make that decision before you select a key spec.
      AWS KMS supports the following RSA key specs for encryption and decryption or signing and 
      veriﬁcation:
      • RSA_2048
      • RSA_3072
      • RSA_4096
      RSA key specs diﬀer by the length of the RSA key in bits. The RSA key spec that you choose might 
      be determined by your security standards or the requirements of your task. In general, use the 
      largest key that is practical and aﬀordable for your task. Cryptographic operations on KMS keys 
      with diﬀerent RSA key specs are priced diﬀerently. For information about AWS KMS pricing, see
      AWS Key Management Service Pricing. For information about request quotas, see Request quotas.

      RSA key specs for encryption and decryption
      When an RSA asymmetric KMS key is used for encryption and decryption, you encrypt with the 
      public key and decrypt with the private key. When you call the Encrypt operation in AWS KMS for 
      an RSA KMS key, AWS KMS uses the public key in the RSA key pair and the encryption algorithm 
      you specify to encrypt your data. To decrypt the ciphertext, call the Decrypt operation and specify 
      the same KMS key and encryption algorithm. AWS KMS then uses the private key in the RSA key 
      pair to decrypt your data.
      You can also download the public key and use it to encrypt data outside of AWS KMS. Be sure to 
      use an encryption algorithm that AWS KMS supports for RSA KMS keys. To decrypt the ciphertext, 
      call the Decrypt function with the same KMS key and encryption algorithm.
      AWS KMS supports two encryption algorithms for KMS keys with RSA key specs. These algorithms, 
      which are deﬁned in PKCS #1 v2.2, diﬀer in the hash function they use internally. In AWS KMS, the 
      RSAES_OAEP algorithms always use the same hash function for both hashing purposes and for the
      mask generation function (MGF1). You are required to specify an encryption algorithm when you 
      call the Encrypt and Decrypt operations. You can choose a diﬀerent algorithm for each request.

                                               function along with an empty label.
      You cannot conﬁgure a KMS key to use a particular encryption algorithm. However, you can use the
      kms:EncryptionAlgorithm policy condition to specify the encryption algorithms that principals are 
      allowed to use with the KMS key.
      To get the encryption algorithms for a KMS key, view the cryptographic conﬁguration of the KMS 
      key in the AWS KMS console or use the DescribeKey operation. AWS KMS also provides the key spec 
      RSA key specs                                                               1075

      and encryption algorithms when you download your public key, either in the AWS KMS console or 
      by using the GetPublicKey operation.
      You might choose an RSA key spec based on the length of the plaintext data that you can encrypt 
      in each request. The following table shows the maximum size, in bytes, of the plaintext that 
      you can encrypt in a single call to the Encrypt operation. The values diﬀer with the key spec and 
      encryption algorithm. To compare, you can use a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt up to 
      4096 bytes at one time.
      To compute the maximum plaintext length in bytes for these algorithms, use the following 
      formula: (key_size_in_bits / 8) - (2 * hash_length_in_bits/8) - 2. For example, for 
      RSA_2048 with SHA-256, the maximum plaintext size in bytes is (2048/8) - (2 * 256/8) -2 = 190.

      RSA key specs for signing and veriﬁcation
      When an RSA asymmetric KMS key is used for signing and veriﬁcation, you generate the signature 
      for a message with the private key and verify the signature with the public key.
      When you call the Sign operation in AWS KMS for an asymmetric KMS key, AWS KMS uses the 
      private key in the RSA key pair, the message, and the signing algorithm you specify, to generate a 
      signature. To verify the signature, call the Verify operation. Specify the signature, plus the same 
      KMS key, message, and signing algorithm. AWS KMS then uses the public key in the RSA key pair to 
      verify the signature. You can also download the public key and use it to verify the signature outside 
      of AWS KMS.
      AWS KMS supports the following signing algorithms for all KMS keys with an RSA key spec. You 
      are required to specify a signing algorithm when you call the Sign and Verify operations. You 
      can choose a diﬀerent algorithm for each request. When signing with RSA key pairs, RSASSA-

      Elliptic curve key specs
      When you use an elliptic curve (ECC) key spec, AWS KMS creates an asymmetric KMS key with an 
      ECC key pair for signing and veriﬁcation or deriving shared secrets (but not both). The private key 
      that generates signatures or derives shared secrets never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. You can 
      use the public key to verify signatures within AWS KMS, or download the public key for use outside 
      of AWS KMS.
      AWS KMS supports the following ECC key specs for asymmetric KMS keys.
      • Asymmetric NIST-recommended elliptic curve key pairs (signing and veriﬁcation -or- deriving 
        shared secrets)
        • ECC_NIST_P256 (secp256r1)
        • ECC_NIST_P384 (secp384r1)
        • ECC_NIST_P521 (secp521r1)
      • Other asymmetric elliptic curve key pairs (signing and veriﬁcation)
        • ECC_SECG_P256K1 (secp256k1), commonly used for cryptocurrencies.
      The ECC key spec that you choose might be determined by your security standards or the 
      requirements of your task. In general, use the curve with the most points that is practical and 
      aﬀordable for your task.
      If you're creating an asymmetric KMS key to derive shared secrets, use one of the NIST-
      recommended elliptic curve key specs. The only supported key agreement algorithm for deriving 
      shared secrets is the Elliptic Curve Cryptography Cofactor Diﬃe-Hellman Primitive (ECDH). For an 
      example of how to derive shared secrets oﬄine, see the section called “Deriving shared secrets 
      oﬄine”.
      If you're creating an asymmetric KMS key to use with cryptocurrencies, use the ECC_SECG_P256K1 
      key spec. You can also use this key spec for other purposes, but it is required for Bitcoin, and other 
      cryptocurrencies.
      KMS keys with diﬀerent ECC key specs are priced diﬀerently and are subject to diﬀerent request 
      quotas. For information about AWS KMS pricing, see AWS Key Management Service Pricing. For 
      information about request quotas, see Request quotas.

     Key specs for HMAC KMS keys
     AWS KMS supports symmetric HMAC keys in varying lengths. The key spec that you select can 
     depend on your security, regulatory, or business requirements. The length of the key determines 
     Key specs for HMAC KMS keys                                       1079

      are more secure. Use the longest key that is practical for your use case.

      ML-DSA key specs
      An ML-DSA key is a cryptographic key used in the Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature 
      Algorithm (ML-DSA), which is designed for post-quantum cryptography. This algorithm is part 
      of the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standardization eﬀort, speciﬁcally 
      outlined in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 204.
      ML-DSA keys are used in a public-private key pair system. The private key is used for signing data, 
      while the public key is used for verifying the signature. This system ensures the authenticity, 
      integrity, and non-repudiation of digital messages or documents, even in the face of potential 
      quantum computer threats.
      When you create a key with the ML-DSA key spec, AWS KMS creates an asymmetric KMS key with 
      a ML-DSA key pair for signing and veriﬁcation. The private key that generates signatures never 
      leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. You can use the public key to verify signatures within AWS KMS, or
      download the public key for use outside of AWS KMS.
      AWS KMS supports the following ML-DSA key specs for asymmetric KMS keys:
      • ML_DSA_44
      • ML_DSA_65
      • ML_DSA_87
      AWS KMS supports the ML_DSA_SHAKE_256 signing algorithm for all of the ML-DSA key specs.

      SM2 key spec (China Regions only)
      The SM2 key spec is an elliptic curve key spec deﬁned within the GM/T series of speciﬁcations 
      published by China's Oﬃce of State Commercial Cryptography Administration (OSCCA). The SM2 
      key spec is available only in China Regions. When you use the SM2 key spec, AWS KMS creates an 
      asymmetric KMS key with an SM2 key pair. You can use your SM2 key pair within AWS KMS, or 
      download the public key for use outside of AWS KMS. For more information, see the section called 
      “Oﬄine veriﬁcation with SM2 key pairs (China Regions only)”.
      Each KMS key can have only one key usage. You can use an SM2 KMS key for signing and 
      veriﬁcation, encryption and decryption, or deriving shared secrets. You must specify the key usage 
      when you create the KMS key, and you cannot change it after the key is created.
      If you're creating an asymmetric KMS key to derive shared secrets, use the SM2 key spec. The only 
      supported key agreement algorithm for deriving shared secrets is the Elliptic Curve Cryptography 
      Cofactor Diﬃe-Hellman Primitive (ECDH).
      AWS KMS supports the following SM2 encryption and signing algorithms:
      • SM2PKE encryption algorithm
           SM2PKE is an elliptic curve based encryption algorithm deﬁned by OSCCA in GM/T 
           0003.4-2012.
      • SM2DSA signing algorithm
           SM2DSA is an elliptic curve based signing algorithm deﬁned by OSCCA in GM/T 0003.2-2012. 
           SM2DSA requires a distinguishing ID that is hashed with the SM3 hashing algorithm and 
           then combined with the message, or message digest, that you passed to AWS KMS. This 
           concatenated value is then hashed and signed by AWS KMS.
      AWS KMS permissions
      This table is designed to help you understand AWS KMS permissions so you can control access to 
      your AWS KMS resources. Deﬁnitions of the column headings appear below the table.
      You can also learn about AWS KMS permissions in the Actions, resources, and condition keys for 
      AWS Key Management Service topic of the Service Authorization Reference. However, that topic 
      doesn't list all of the condition keys that you can use to reﬁne each permission.

       Column descriptions
       The columns in this table provide the following information:
       • Actions and permissions lists each AWS KMS API operation and the permission that allows the 
         operation. You specify the operation in Action element of a policy statement.
       • Policy type indicates whether the permission can be used in a key policy or IAM policy.
       Column descriptions                                                                    1128
      AWS Key Management Service                                                     Developer Guide
        Key policy means that you can specify the permission in the key policy. When the key policy 
        contains the policy statement that enables IAM policies, you can specify the permission in an IAM 
        policy.
        IAM policy means that you can specify the permission only in an IAM policy.
      • Cross-account use shows the operations that authorized users can perform on resources in a 
        diﬀerent AWS account.
        A value of Yes means that principals can perform the operation on resources in a diﬀerent AWS 
        account.
        A value of No means that principals can perform the operation only on resources in their own 
        AWS account.
        If you give a principal in a diﬀerent account a permission that can't be used on a cross-account 
        resource, the permission is not eﬀective. For example, if you give a principal in a diﬀerent 
        account kms:TagResource permission to a KMS key in your account, their attempts to tag the 
        KMS key in your account will fail.
      • Resources lists the AWS KMS resources to which the permissions apply. AWS KMS supports two 
        resource types: a KMS key and an alias. In a key policy, the value of the Resource element is 
        always *, which indicates the KMS key to which the key policy is attached.
        Use the following values to represent an AWS KMS resource in an IAM policy.
        KMS key
           When the resource is a KMS key, use its key ARN. For help, see the section called “Find the key 
           ID and key ARN”.
           arn:AWS_partition_name:kms:AWS_Region:AWS_account_ID:key/key_ID
           For example:
           arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
        Alias
           When the resource is an alias, use its alias ARN. For help, see the section called “Find the alias 
           name and alias ARN”.
           arn:AWS_partition_name:kms:AWS_region:AWS_account_ID:alias/alias_name
      Column descriptions                                                                   1129
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
           For example:
           arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias
        * (asterisk)
           When the permission doesn't apply to a particular resource (KMS key or alias), use an asterisk 
           (*).
           In an IAM policy for an AWS KMS permission, an asterisk in the Resource element indicates 
           all AWS KMS resources (KMS keys and aliases). You can also use an asterisk in the Resource
           element when the AWS KMS permission doesn't apply to any particular KMS keys or aliases. 
           For example, when allowing or denying kms:CreateKey or kms:ListKeys permission, you 
           must set the Resource element to *.
      • AWS KMS condition keys lists the AWS KMS condition keys that you can use to control access to 
        the operation. You specify conditions in a policy's Condition element. For more information, 
        see AWS KMS condition keys. This column also includes AWS global condition keys that are 
        supported by AWS KMS, but not by all AWS services.
      AWS KMS internal operations
      AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) provides cryptographic keys and operations secured 
      by FIPS 140-3 Security Level 3 validated hardware security modules (HSM) scaled for the cloud. 
      AWS KMS keys and functionality are used by multiple AWS cloud services, and you can use them 
      to protect data in your applications. This technical guide provides details on the cryptographic 
      operations that are run within AWS when you use AWS KMS.
      AWS KMS internals are required to scale and secure HSMs for a globally distributed key 
      management service.

      Domains and domain state
      A cooperative collection of trusted internal AWS KMS entities within an AWS Region is referred 
      to as a domain. A domain includes a set of trusted entities, a set of rules, and a set of secret keys, 
      called domain keys. The domain keys are shared among HSMs that are members of the domain. A 
      domain state consists of the following ﬁelds.
      Name
         A domain name to identify this domain.
      Members
         A list of HSMs that are members of the domain, including their public signing key and public 
         agreement keys.
      Operators
         A list of entities, public signing keys, and a role (AWS KMS operator or service host) that 
         represents the operators of this service.
      Rules
         A list of quorum rules for each command that must be satisﬁed to run a command on the HSM.
      Domain keys
         A list of domain keys (symmetric keys) currently in use within the domain.
      The full domain state is available only on the HSM. The domain state is synchronized between HSM 
      domain members as an exported domain token.
      Domain keys
      All the HSMs in a domain share a set of domain keys, {DK  }. These keys are shared through a 
                                                          r
      domain state export routine. The exported domain state can be imported into any HSM that is a 
      member of the domain.
      The set of domain keys, {DK  }, always includes one active domain key, and several deactivated 
                                r
      domain keys. Domain keys are rotated daily to ensure that AWS complies with Recommendation 
      for Key Management - Part 1. During domain key rotation, all existing KMS keys encrypted 
      under the outgoing domain key are re-encrypted under the new active domain key. The active 
      domain key is used to encrypt any new EKTs. The expired domain keys can be used only to decrypt 
      Domains and domain state                                                               1131

      previously encrypted EKTs for a number of days equivalent to the number of recently rotated 
      domain keys.
      Exported domain tokens
      There is a regular need to synchronize state between domain participants. This is accomplished 
      through exporting the domain state whenever a change is made to the domain. The domain state 
      is exported as an exported domain token.
      Name
         A domain name to identify this domain.
      Members
         A list of HSMs that are members of the domain, including their signing and agreement public 
         keys.
      Operators
         A list of entities, public signing keys, and a role that represents the operators of this service.
      Rules
         A list of quorum rules for each command that must be satisﬁed to run a command on an HSM 
         domain member.
      Encrypted domain keys
         Envelope-encrypted domain keys. The domain keys are encrypted by the signing member for 
         each of the members listed above, enveloped to their public agreement key.
      Signature
         A signature on the domain state produced by an HSM, necessarily a member of the domain that 
         exported the domain state.
      The exported domain token forms the fundamental source of trust for entities operating within the 
      domain.
      Managing domain states
      The domain state is managed through quorum-authenticated commands. These changes include 
      modifying the list of trusted participants in the domain, modifying the quorum rules for running 
      Domains and domain state                                                              1132
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      HSM commands, and periodically rotating the domain keys. These commands are authenticated on 
      a per-command basis as opposed to authenticated session operations, as shown in the following 
      image.
      In its initialized and operational state, an HSM contains a set of self-generated asymmetric identity 
      keys, a signing key pair, and a key-establishment key pair. Through a manual process, an AWS 
      KMS operator can establish an initial domain to be created on a ﬁrst HSM in a Region. This initial 
      domain consists of a full domain state as deﬁned previously in this topic. It is installed through a 
      join command to each of the deﬁned HSM members in the domain.
      After an HSM has joined an initial domain, it is bound to the rules that are deﬁned in that domain. 
      These rules govern the commands that use customer cryptographic keys or make changes to the 
      host or domain state. The authenticated session API operations that use your cryptographic keys 
      have been deﬁned earlier.
      The foregoing image depicts how a domain state gets modiﬁed. The process consists of four steps:
      1. A quorum-based command is sent to an HSM to modify the domain.
      2. A new domain state is generated and exported as a new exported domain token. The state on 
         the HSM is not modiﬁed, meaning that the change is not enacted on the HSM.
      3. A second command is sent to each of the HSMs in the newly exported domain token to update 
         their domain state with the new domain token.
      4. The HSMs listed in the new exported domain token can authenticate the command and the 
         domain token. They can also unpack the domain keys to update the domain state on all HSMs in 
         the domain.
      Domains and domain state                                                              1133
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      HSMs do not communicate directly with one another. Instead, a quorum of operators requests a 
      change to the domain state that results in a new exported domain token. A service host member of 
      the domain is used to distribute the new domain state to every HSM in the domain.
      The leaving and joining of a domain are done through the HSM management functions. The 
      modiﬁcation of the domain state is done through the domain management functions.
      Leave domain
         Causes an HSM to leave a domain, deleting all remnants and keys of that domain from memory.
      Join domain
         Causes an HSM to join a new domain or update its current domain state to the new domain 
         state. The existing domain is used as source of the initial set of rules to authenticate this 
         message.
      Create domain
         Causes a new domain to be created on an HSM. Returns a ﬁrst domain token that can be 
         distributed to member HSMs of the domain.
      Modify operators
         Adds or removes operators from the list of authorized operators and their roles in the domain.
      Modify members
         Adds or removes an HSM from the list of authorized HSMs in the domain.
      Modify rules
         Modiﬁes the set of quorum rules that are required to run commands on an HSM.
      Rotate domain keys
         Causes a new domain key to be created and marked as the active domain key. This moves 
         the existing active key to a deactivated key and removes the oldest deactivated key from the 
         domain state.
      Internal communication security
      Commands between the service hosts or AWS KMS operators and the HSMs are secured through 
      two mechanisms depicted in Authenticated sessions: a quorum-signed request method and an 
      authenticated session using an HSM-service host protocol.
      Internal communication security                                                       1134
      AWS Key Management Service                                         Developer Guide
      The quorum-signed commands are designed so that no single operator can modify the critical 
      security protections that the HSMs provide. The commands that run over the authenticated 
      sessions help ensure that only authorized service operators can perform operations involving KMS 
      keys. All customer-bound secret information is secured across the AWS infrastructure.
      Key establishment
      To secure internal communications, AWS KMS uses two diﬀerent key establishment methods. The 
      ﬁrst is deﬁned as C(1, 2, ECC DH) in Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes 
      Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography. This scheme has an initiator with a static signing key. The 
      initiator generates and signs an ephemeral elliptic curve Diﬃe-Hellman (ECDH) key, intended for 
      a recipient with a static ECDH agreement key. This method uses one ephemeral key and two static 
      keys using ECDH. That is the derivation of the label C(1, 2, ECC DH). This method is sometimes 
      called one-pass ECDH.
      The second key establishment method is C(2, 2, ECC, DH). In this scheme, both parties have a 
      static signing key, and they generate, sign, and exchange an ephemeral ECDH key. This method 
      uses two static keys and two ephemeral keys, each using ECDH. That is the derivation of the label 
      C(2, 2, ECC, DH). This method is sometimes called ECDH ephemeral or ECDHE. All ECDH keys are 
      generated on the curve secp384r1 (NIST-P384).
      HSM security boundary
      The inner security boundary of AWS KMS is the HSM. The HSM has a proprietary interface and no 
      other active physical interfaces in its operational state. An operational HSM is provisioned during 
      initialization with the necessary cryptographic keys to establish its role in the domain. Sensitive 
      cryptographic materials of the HSM are only stored in volatile memory and erased when the HSM 
      moves out of the operational state, including intended or unintended shutdowns or resets.
      The HSM API operations are authenticated either by individual commands or over a mutually 
      authenticated conﬁdential session established by a service host.
      Quorum-signed commands
      Quorum-signed commands are issued by operators to HSMs. This section describes how quorum-
      based commands are created, signed, and authenticated. These rules are fairly simple. For 
      example, command Foo requires two members from role Bar to be authenticated. There are three 
      steps in the creation and veriﬁcation of a quorum-based command. The ﬁrst step is the initial 
      command creation; the second is the submission to additional operators to sign; and the third is 
      the veriﬁcation and execution.
      Internal communication security                                          1135
       AWS Key Management Service                                                           Developer Guide
       For the purpose of introducing the concepts, assume that there is an authentic set of operator's 
       public keys and roles {QOS }, and a set of quorum-rules QR = {Command, Rule    } where each Rule
                                 s                                           i    {i, t}
       is a set of roles and minimum number N {Role , N }. For a command to satisfy the quorum rule, the 
                                                   t  t
       command dataset must be signed by a set of operators listed in {QOS } such that they meet one of 
                                                                          s
       the rules listed for that command. As mentioned earlier, the set of quorum rules and operators are 
       stored in the domain state and the exported domain token.
       In practice, an initial signer signs the command Sig  = Sign(dO , Command) . A second operator 
                                                        1          p1
       also signs the command Sig  = Sign(dO , Command) . The doubly signed message is sent to an 
                                  2         p2
       HSM for execution. The HSM performs the following:
       1. For each signature, it extracts the signer's public key from the domain state and veriﬁes the 
         signature on the command.
       2. It veriﬁes that the set of signers satisﬁes a rule for the command.
       Authenticated sessions
       Your key operations run between the externally facing AWS KMS hosts and the HSMs. These 
       commands pertain to the creation and use of cryptographic keys and secure random number 
       generation. The commands run over a session-authenticated channel between the service hosts 
       and the HSMs. In addition to the need for authenticity, these sessions require conﬁdentiality. 
       Commands running over these sessions include the returning of cleartext data keys and decrypted 
       messages intended for you. To ensure that these sessions cannot be subverted through man-in-
       the-middle attacks, sessions are authenticated.
       This protocol performs a mutually authenticated ECDHE key agreement between the HSM and the 
       service host. The exchange is initiated by the service host and completed by the HSM. The HSM 
       also returns a session key (SK) encrypted by the negotiated key and an exported key token that 
       contains the session key. The exported key token contains a validity period, after which the service 
       host must renegotiate a session key.
       A service host is a member of the domain and has an identity-signing key pair (dHOS, QHOS)
                                                                                         i      i
       and an authentic copy of the HSMs' identity public keys. It uses its set of identity-signing keys to 
       securely negotiate a session key that can be used between the service host and any HSM in the 
       domain. The exported key tokens have a validity period associated with them, after which a new 
       key must be negotiated.
       Internal communication security                                                              1136
     AWS Key Management Service                                      Developer Guide
     The process begins with the service host recognition that it requires a session key to send and 
     receive sensitive communication ﬂows between itself and an HSM member of the domain.
     1. A service host generates an ECDH ephemeral key pair (d , Q ) and signs it with its identity key
                                               1  1
       Sig1 = Sign(dOS,Q ).
                    1
     2. The HSM veriﬁes the signature on the received public key using its current domain token 
       and creates an ECDH ephemeral key pair (d , Q ). It then completes the ECDH-key-exchange 
                                      2  2
       according to Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete 
       Logarithm Cryptography to form a negotiated 256-bit AES-GCM key. The HSM generates a 
       fresh 256-bit AES-GCM session key. It encrypts the session key with the negotiated key to form 
       the encrypted session key (ESK). It also encrypts the session key under the domain key as an 
       exported key token EKT. Finally, it signs a return value with its identity key pair Sig  = Sign(dHSK, 
                                                                  2
       (Q , ESK, EKT)).
         2
     3. The service host veriﬁes the signature on the received keys using its current domain token. The 
       service host then completes the ECDH key exchange according to Recommendation for Pair-Wise 
       Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography. It next decrypts the ESK to 
       obtain the session key SK.
     During the validity period in the EKT, the service host can use the negotiated session key SK to 
     send envelope-encrypted commands to the HSM. Every service-host-initiated command over this 
     authenticated session includes the EKT. The HSM responds using the same negotiated session key 
     SK.
     Replication process for multi-Region keys
     AWS KMS uses a cross-Region replication mechanism to copy the key material in a KMS key from 
     an HSM in one AWS Region to an HSM in a diﬀerent AWS Region. For this mechanism to work, the 
     KMS key that is being replicated must be a multi-Region key. When replicating a KMS key from 
     one Region to another, the HSMs in the Regions cannot communicate directly, because they're 
     Replication process for multi-Region keys                            1137
      AWS Key Management Service                                                      Developer Guide
      in isolated networks. Instead, the messages exchanged during the cross-Region replication are 
      delivered by a proxy service.
      During cross-Region replication, every message generated by an AWS KMS HSM is 
      cryptographically signed using a replication signing key. Replication signing keys (RSKs) are ECDSA 
      keys on the NIST P-384 curve. Every Region owns at least one RSK, and the public component of 
      each RSK is shared with every other Region in the same AWS partition.
      The cross-Region replication process to copy key material from Region A to Region B works as 
      follows:
      1. The HSM in Region B generates an ephemeral ECDH key on the NIST P-384 curve, Replication 
         Agreement Key B (RAKB). The public component of RAKB is sent to an HSM in Region A by the 
         proxy service.
      2. The HSM in Region A receives the public component of RAKB and then generates another 
         ephemeral ECDH key on the NIST P-384 curve, Replication Agreement Key A (RAKA). The HSM 
         runs the ECDH key establishment scheme on RAKA and the public component of RAKB, and 
         derives a symmetric key from the output, the Replication Wrapping Key (RWK). The RWK is used 
         to encrypt the key material of the multi-Region KMS key that is being replicated.
      3. The public component of RAKA and the key material encrypted with the RWK are sent to the 
         HSM in Region B through the proxy service.
      4. The HSM in Region B receives the public component of RAKA and the key material encrypted 
         using the RWK. The HSM derives by RWK by running the ECDH key establishment scheme on 
         RAKB and the public component of RAKA.
      5. The HSM in Region B use the RWK to decrypt the key material from Region A.
      Durability protection
      Additional service durability for keys generated by the service is provided by the use of oﬄine 
      HSMs, multiple nonvolatile storage of exported domain tokens, and redundant storage of 
      encrypted KMS keys. The oﬄine HSMs are members of the existing domains. With the exception 
      of not being online and participating in the regular domain operations, the oﬄine HSMs appear 
      identically in the domain state as the existing HSM members.
      The durability design is intended to protect all KMS keys in a Region should AWS experience 
      a wide-scale loss of either the online HSMs or the set of KMS keys stored within our primary 
      storage system. AWS KMS keys with imported key material are not included under the durability

     protections aﬀorded other KMS keys. In the event of a Regionwide failure in AWS KMS, imported 
     key material may need to be reimported into a KMS key.
     The oﬄine HSMs, and the credentials to access them, are stored in safes within monitored safe 
     rooms in multiple independent geographical locations. Each safe requires at least one AWS security 
     oﬃcer and one AWS KMS operator, from two independent teams in AWS, to obtain these materials. 
     The use of these materials is governed by internal policy requiring a quorum of AWS KMS operators 
     to be present.
