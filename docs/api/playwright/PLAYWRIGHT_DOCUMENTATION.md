Introduction
Playwright Test was created specifically to accommodate the needs of end-to-end testing. Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed with native mobile emulation of Google Chrome for Android and Mobile Safari.

Installing Playwright
Get started by installing Playwright using one of the following methods.
Using npm, yarn or pnpm
The command below either initializes a new project with Playwright, or adds Playwright setup to your current project.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npm init playwright@latest
Run the install command and select the following to get started:
Choose between TypeScript or JavaScript (default is TypeScript)
Name of your Tests folder (default is tests, or e2e if you already have a tests folder in your project)
Add a GitHub Actions workflow to easily run tests on CI
Install Playwright browsers (default is true)
Using the VS Code Extension
Alternatively you can also get started and run your tests using the VS Code Extension.
What's Installed
Playwright will download the browsers needed as well as create the following files.
playwright.config.ts
package.json
package-lock.json
tests/
 example.spec.ts
tests-examples/
 demo-todo-app.spec.ts
The playwright.config is where you can add configuration for Playwright including modifying which browsers you would like to run Playwright on. If you are running tests inside an already existing project then dependencies will be added directly to your package.json.
The tests folder contains a basic example test to help you get started with testing. For a more detailed example check out the tests-examples folder which contains tests written to test a todo app.
Running the Example Test
By default tests will be run on all 3 browsers, Chromium, Firefox and WebKit using several workers. This can be configured in the playwright.config file. Tests are run in headless mode meaning no browser will open up when running the tests. Results of the tests and test logs will be shown in the terminal.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright test
 See our doc on Running Tests to learn more about running tests in headed mode, running multiple tests, running specific tests etc.
HTML Test Reports
After your test completes, an HTML Reporter will be generated, which shows you a full report of your tests allowing you to filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests and flaky tests. You can click on each test and explore the test's errors as well as each step of the test. By default, the HTML report is opened automatically if some of the tests failed.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright show-report

Running the Example Test in UI Mode
Run your tests with UI Mode for a better developer experience with time travel debugging, watch mode and more.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright test --ui

Check out or detailed guide on UI Mode to learn more about its features.
Updating Playwright
To update Playwright to the latest version run the following command:
npm
yarn
pnpm
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest
# Also download new browser binaries and their dependencies:
npx playwright install --with-deps
You can always check which version of Playwright you have by running the following command:
npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright --version
System requirements
Latest version of Node.js 20, 22 or 24.

Writing tests
Introduction
Playwright tests are simple, they
perform actions, and
assert the state against expectations.
There is no need to wait for anything prior to performing an action: Playwright automatically waits for the wide range of actionability checks to pass prior to performing each action.
There is also no need to deal with the race conditions when performing the checks - Playwright assertions are designed in a way that they describe the expectations that need to be eventually met.
That's it! These design choices allow Playwright users to forget about flaky timeouts and racy checks in their tests altogether.
You will learn
How to write the first test
How to perform actions
How to use assertions
How tests run in isolation
How to use test hooks
First test
Take a look at the following example to see how to write a test.
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

 // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
 await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});

test('get started link', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

 // Click the get started link.
 await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' }).click();

 // Expects page to have a heading with the name of Installation.
 await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Installation' })).toBeVisible();
});
NOTE
Add // @ts-check at the start of each test file when using JavaScript in VS Code to get automatic type checking.
Actions
Navigation
Most of the tests will start with navigating page to the URL. After that, test will be able to interact with the page elements.
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
Playwright will wait for page to reach the load state prior to moving forward. Learn more about the page.goto() options.
Interactions
Performing actions starts with locating the elements. Playwright uses Locators API for that. Locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment, learn more about the different types of locators available. Playwright will wait for the element to be actionable prior to performing the action, so there is no need to wait for it to become available.
// Create a locator.
const getStarted = page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' });

// Click it.
await getStarted.click();
In most cases, it'll be written in one line:
await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' }).click();
Basic actions
This is the list of the most popular Playwright actions. Note that there are many more, so make sure to check the Locator API section to learn more about them.
Action
Description
locator.check()
Check the input checkbox
locator.click()
Click the element
locator.uncheck()
Uncheck the input checkbox
locator.hover()
Hover mouse over the element
locator.fill()
Fill the form field, input text
locator.focus()
Focus the element
locator.press()
Press single key
locator.setInputFiles()
Pick files to upload
locator.selectOption()
Select option in the drop down

Assertions
Playwright includes test assertions in the form of expect function. To make an assertion, call expect(value) and choose a matcher that reflects the expectation.
There are many generic matchers like toEqual, toContain, toBeTruthy that can be used to assert any conditions.
expect(success).toBeTruthy();
Playwright also includes async matchers that will wait until the expected condition is met. Using these matchers allows making the tests non-flaky and resilient. For example, this code will wait until the page gets the title containing "Playwright":
await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
Here is the list of the most popular async assertions. Note that there are many more to get familiar with:
Assertion
Description
expect(locator).toBeChecked()
Checkbox is checked
expect(locator).toBeEnabled()
Control is enabled
expect(locator).toBeVisible()
Element is visible
expect(locator).toContainText()
Element contains text
expect(locator).toHaveAttribute()
Element has attribute
expect(locator).toHaveCount()
List of elements has given length
expect(locator).toHaveText()
Element matches text
expect(locator).toHaveValue()
Input element has value
expect(page).toHaveTitle()
Page has title
expect(page).toHaveURL()
Page has URL

Test Isolation
Playwright Test is based on the concept of test fixtures such as the built in page fixture, which is passed into your test. Pages are isolated between tests due to the Browser Context, which is equivalent to a brand new browser profile, where every test gets a fresh environment, even when multiple tests run in a single Browser.
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
 // "page" belongs to an isolated BrowserContext, created for this specific test.
});

test('another test', async ({ page }) => {
 // "page" in this second test is completely isolated from the first test.
});
Using Test Hooks
You can use various test hooks such as test.describe to declare a group of tests and test.beforeEach and test.afterEach which are executed before/after each test. Other hooks include the test.beforeAll and test.afterAll which are executed once per worker before/after all tests.
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('navigation', () => {
 test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
   // Go to the starting url before each test.
   await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
 });

 test('main navigation', async ({ page }) => {
   // Assertions use the expect API.
   await expect(page).toHaveURL('https://playwright.dev/');
 });
});

Generating tests
Introduction
Playwright comes with the ability to generate tests out of the box and is a great way to quickly get started with testing. It will open two windows, a browser window where you interact with the website you wish to test and the Playwright Inspector window where you can record your tests, copy the tests, clear your tests as well as change the language of your tests.
You will learn
How to record a test
How to generate locators
Running Codegen
Use the codegen command to run the test generator followed by the URL of the website you want to generate tests for. The URL is optional and you can always run the command without it and then add the URL directly into the browser window instead.
npx playwright codegen demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
Recording a test
Run codegen and perform actions in the browser. Playwright will generate the code for the user interactions. Codegen will look at the rendered page and figure out the recommended locator, prioritizing role, text and test id locators. If the generator identifies multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient and uniquely identify the target element, therefore eliminating and reducing test(s) failing and flaking due to locators.
With the test generator you can record:
Actions like click or fill by simply interacting with the page
Assertions by clicking on one of the icons in the toolbar and then clicking on an element on the page to assert against. You can choose:
'assert visibility' to assert that an element is visible
'assert text' to assert that an element contains specific text
'assert value' to assert that an element has a specific value

When you have finished interacting with the page, press the 'record' button to stop the recording and use the 'copy' button to copy the generated code to your editor.
Use the 'clear' button to clear the code to start recording again. Once finished close the Playwright inspector window or stop the terminal command.
To learn more about generating tests check out or detailed guide on Codegen.
Generating locators
You can generate locators with the test generator.
Press the 'Record' button to stop the recording and the 'Pick Locator' button will appear.
Click on the 'Pick Locator' button and then hover over elements in the browser window to see the locator highlighted underneath each element.
To choose a locator click on the element you would like to locate and the code for that locator will appear in the locator playground next to the Pick Locator button.
You can then edit the locator in the locator playground to fine tune it and see the matching element highlighted in the browser window.
Use the copy button to copy the locator and paste it into your code.

Emulation
You can also generate tests using emulation so as to generate a test for a specific viewport, device, color scheme, as well as emulate the geolocation, language or timezone. The test generator can also generate a test while preserving authenticated state. Check out the Test Generator guide to learn more.

Running and debugging tests
Introduction
With Playwright you can run a single test, a set of tests or all tests. Tests can be run on one browser or multiple browsers by using the --project flag. Tests are run in parallel by default and are run in a headless manner, meaning no browser window will be opened while running the tests and results will be seen in the terminal. However, you can run tests in headed mode by using the --headed CLI argument, or you can run your tests in UI mode by using the --ui flag. See a full trace of your tests complete with watch mode, time travel debugging and more.
You will learn
How to run tests from the command line
How to debug tests
How to open the HTML test reporter
Running tests
Command line
You can run your tests with the playwright test command. This will run your tests on all browsers as configured in the playwright.config file. Tests run in headless mode by default meaning no browser window will be opened while running the tests and results will be seen in the terminal.
npx playwright test

Run tests in UI mode
We highly recommend running your tests with UI Mode for a better developer experience where you can easily walk through each step of the test and visually see what was happening before, during and after each step. UI mode also comes with many other features such as the locator picker, watch mode and more.
npx playwright test --ui

Check out or detailed guide on UI Mode to learn more about its features.
Run tests in headed mode
To run your tests in headed mode, use the --headed flag. This will give you the ability to visually see how Playwright interacts with the website.
npx playwright test --headed
Run tests on different browsers
To specify which browser you would like to run your tests on, use the --project flag followed by the name of the browser.
npx playwright test --project webkit
To specify multiple browsers to run your tests on, use the --project flag multiple times followed by the name of each browser.
npx playwright test --project webkit --project firefox
Run specific tests
To run a single test file, pass in the name of the test file that you want to run.
npx playwright test landing-page.spec.ts
To run a set of test files from different directories, pass in the names of the directories that you want to run the tests in.
npx playwright test tests/todo-page/ tests/landing-page/
To run files that have landing or login in the file name, simply pass in these keywords to the CLI.
npx playwright test landing login
To run a test with a specific title, use the -g flag followed by the title of the test.
npx playwright test -g "add a todo item"
Run last failed tests
To run only the tests that failed in the last test run, first run your tests and then run them again with the --last-failed flag.
npx playwright test --last-failed
Run tests in VS Code
Tests can be run right from VS Code using the VS Code extension. Once installed you can simply click the green triangle next to the test you want to run or run all tests from the testing sidebar. Check out our Getting Started with VS Code guide for more details.

Debugging tests
Since Playwright runs in Node.js, you can debug it with your debugger of choice e.g. using console.log or inside your IDE or directly in VS Code with the VS Code Extension. Playwright comes with UI Mode, where you can easily walk through each step of the test, see logs, errors, network requests, inspect the DOM snapshot and more. You can also use the Playwright Inspector, which allows you to step through Playwright API calls, see their debug logs and explore locators.

UI mode also comes with many other features such as the locator picker, watch mode and more.
npx playwright test --ui

While debugging you can use the Pick Locator button to select an element on the page and see the locator that Playwright would use to find that element. You can also edit the locator in the locator playground and see it highlighting live on the Browser window. Use the Copy Locator button to copy the locator to your clipboard and then paste it into your test.

Check out our detailed guide on UI Mode to learn more about its features.
Debug tests with the Playwright Inspector
To debug all tests, run the Playwright test command followed by the --debug flag.
npx playwright test --debug

This command will open up a Browser window as well as the Playwright Inspector. You can use the step over button at the top of the inspector to step through your test. Or, press the play button to run your test from start to finish. Once the test has finished, the browser window will close.
To debug one test file, run the Playwright test command with the name of the test file that you want to debug followed by the --debug flag.
npx playwright test example.spec.ts --debug
To debug a specific test from the line number where the test(.. is defined, add a colon followed by the line number at the end of the test file name, followed by the --debug flag.
npx playwright test example.spec.ts:10 --debug
While debugging you can use the Pick Locator button to select an element on the page and see the locator that Playwright would use to find that element. You can also edit the locator and see it highlighting live on the Browser window. Use the Copy Locator button to copy the locator to your clipboard and then paste it into your test.

Check out our debugging guide to learn more about debugging with the VS Code debugger, UI Mode and the Playwright Inspector as well as debugging with Browser Developer tools.
Test reports
The HTML Reporter shows you a full report of your tests allowing you to filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests and flaky tests. By default, the HTML report is opened automatically if some of the tests failed, otherwise you can open it with the following command.
npx playwright show-report

You can filter and search for tests as well as click on each test to see the tests errors and explore each step of the test.

Trace viewer
Introduction
Playwright Trace Viewer is a GUI tool that lets you explore recorded Playwright traces of your tests meaning you can go back and forward through each action of your test and visually see what was happening during each action.
You will learn
How to record a trace
How to open the HTML report
How to open and view the trace
Recording a Trace
By default the playwright.config file will contain the configuration needed to create a trace.zip file for each test. Traces are setup to run on-first-retry meaning they will be run on the first retry of a failed test. Also retries are set to 2 when running on CI and 0 locally. This means the traces will be recorded on the first retry of a failed test but not on the first run and not on the second retry.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0, // set to 2 when running on CI
 // ...
 use: {
   trace: 'on-first-retry', // record traces on first retry of each test
 },
});
To learn more about available options to record a trace check out our detailed guide on Trace Viewer.
Traces are normally run in a Continuous Integration(CI) environment, because locally you can use UI Mode for developing and debugging tests. However, if you want to run traces locally without using UI Mode, you can force tracing to be on with --trace on.
npx playwright test --trace on
Opening the HTML report
The HTML report shows you a report of all your tests that have been run and on which browsers as well as how long they took. Tests can be filtered by passed tests, failed, flaky or skipped tests. You can also search for a particular test. Clicking on a test will open the detailed view where you can see more information on your tests such as the errors, the test steps and the trace.
npx playwright show-report
Opening the trace
In the HTML report click on the trace icon next to the test name file name to directly open the trace for the required test.

You can also click open the detailed view of the test and scroll down to the 'Traces' tab and open the trace by clicking on the trace screenshot.

To learn more about reporters check out our detailed guide on reporters including the HTML Reporter.
Viewing the trace
View traces of your test by clicking through each action or hovering using the timeline and see the state of the page before and after the action. Inspect the log, source and network, errors and console during each step of the test. The trace viewer creates a DOM snapshot so you can fully interact with it and open the browser DevTools to inspect the HTML, CSS, etc.

To learn more about traces check out our detailed guide on Trace Viewer.

Setting up CI
Introduction
Playwright tests can be run on any CI provider. This guide covers one way of running tests on GitHub using GitHub actions. If you would like to learn more, or how to configure other CI providers, check out our detailed doc on Continuous Integration.
You will learn

How to publish report on the web
Setting up GitHub Actions
When installing Playwright using the VS Code extension or with npm init playwright@latest you are given the option to add a GitHub Actions workflow. This creates a playwright.yml file inside a .github/workflows folder containing everything you need so that your tests run on each push and pull request into the main/master branch. Here's how that file looks:
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
 push:
   branches: [ main, master ]
 pull_request:
   branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
 test:
   timeout-minutes: 60
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
   - uses: actions/checkout@v4
   - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
     with:
       node-version: lts/*
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: npm ci
   - name: Install Playwright Browsers
     run: npx playwright install --with-deps
   - name: Run Playwright tests
     run: npx playwright test
   - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
     if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
     with:
       name: playwright-report
       path: playwright-report/
       retention-days: 30
The workflow performs these steps:
Clone your repository
Install Node.js
Install NPM Dependencies
Install Playwright Browsers
Run Playwright tests
Upload HTML report to the GitHub UI
To learn more about this, see "Understanding GitHub Actions".
Create a Repo and Push to GitHub
Once you have your GitHub actions workflow setup then all you need to do is Create a repo on GitHub or push your code to an existing repository. Follow the instructions on GitHub and don't forget to initialize a git repository using the git init command so you can add, commit and push your code.

Opening the Workflows
Click on the Actions tab to see the workflows. Here you will see if your tests have passed or failed.

Viewing Test Logs
Clicking on the workflow run will show you the all the actions that GitHub performed and clicking on Run Playwright tests will show the error messages, what was expected and what was received as well as the call log.

HTML Report
The HTML Report shows you a full report of your tests. You can filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests and flaky tests.
Downloading the HTML Report
In the Artifacts section click on the playwright-report to download your report in the format of a zip file.

Viewing the HTML Report
Locally opening the report will not work as expected as you need a web server in order for everything to work correctly. First, extract the zip, preferably in a folder that already has Playwright installed. Using the command line change into the directory where the report is and use npx playwright show-report followed by the name of the extracted folder. This will serve up the report and enable you to view it in your browser.
npx playwright show-report name-of-my-extracted-playwright-report

To learn more about reports check out our detailed guide on HTML Reporter
Viewing the Trace
Once you have served the report using npx playwright show-report, click on the trace icon next to the test's file name as seen in the image above. You can then view the trace of your tests and inspect each action to try to find out why the tests are failing.

Publishing report on the web
Downloading the HTML report as a zip file is not very convenient. However, we can utilize Azure Storage's static websites hosting capabilities to easily and efficiently serve HTML reports on the Internet, requiring minimal configuration.
Create an Azure Storage account.
Enable Static website hosting for the storage account.
Create a Service Principal in Azure and grant it access to Azure Blob storage. Upon successful execution, the command will display the credentials which will be used in the next step.
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-actions" --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>
Use the credentials from the previous step to set up encrypted secrets in your GitHub repository. Go to your repository's settings, under GitHub Actions secrets, and add the following secrets:
AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID
AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET
AZCOPY_TENANT_ID
For a detailed guide on how to authorize a service principal using a client secret, refer to this Microsoft documentation.
Add a step that uploads the HTML report to Azure Storage.
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
...
   - name: Upload HTML report to Azure
      shell: bash
      run: |
        REPORT_DIR='run-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}'
        azcopy cp --recursive "./playwright-report/*" "https://<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/\$web/$REPORT_DIR"
        echo "::notice title=HTML report url::https://<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.z1.web.core.windows.net/$REPORT_DIR/index.html"
      env:
        AZCOPY_AUTO_LOGIN_TYPE: SPN
        AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID }}'
        AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET }}'
        AZCOPY_TENANT_ID: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_TENANT_ID }}'


The contents of the $web storage container can be accessed from a browser by using the public URL of the website.
NOTE
This step will not work for pull requests created from a forked repository because such workflow doesn't have access to the secrets.
Properly handling Secrets
Artifacts like trace files, HTML reports or even the console logs contain information about your test execution. They can contain sensitive data like user credentials for a test user, access tokens to a staging backend, testing source code or sometimes even your application source code. Treat these files just as careful as you treat that sensitive data. If you upload reports and traces as part of your CI workflow, make sure that you only upload them to trusted artifact stores, or that you encrypt the files before upload. The same is true for sharing artifacts with team members: Use a trusted file share or encrypt the files before sharing.

Getting started - VS Code
Introduction
Playwright Test was created specifically to accommodate the needs of end-to-end testing. Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed with native mobile emulation of Google Chrome for Android and Mobile Safari.
Get started by installing Playwright and generating a test to see it in action. Alternatively you can also get started and run your tests using the CLI.
Installation
Playwright has a VS Code extension which is available when testing with Node.js. Install it from the VS Code marketplace or from the extensions tab in VS Code.

Once installed, open the command panel and type:
Install Playwright

Select Test: Install Playwright and Choose the browsers you would like to run your tests on. These can be later configured in the playwright.config file. You can also choose if you would like to have a GitHub Actions setup to run your tests on CI.

Opening the testing sidebar
The testing sidebar can be opened by clicking on the testing icon in the activity bar. This will give you access to the test explorer, which will show you all the tests in your project as well as the Playwright sidebar which includes projects, settings, tools and setup.

Running tests
You can run a single test by clicking the green triangle next to your test block to run your test. Playwright will run through each line of the test and when it finishes you will see a green tick next to your test block as well as the time it took to run the test.

Run tests and show browsers
You can also run your tests and show the browsers by selecting the option Show Browsers in the testing sidebar. Then when you click the green triangle to run your test the browser will open and you will visually see it run through your test. Leave this selected if you want browsers open for all your tests or uncheck it if you prefer your tests to run in headless mode with no browser open.

Use the Close all browsers button to close all browsers.
View and run all tests
View all tests in the testing sidebar and extend the tests by clicking on each test. Tests that have not been run will not have the green check next to them. Run all tests by clicking on the white triangle as you hover over the tests in the testing sidebar.

Running tests on multiple browsers
The first section in the Playwright sidebar is the projects section. Here you can see all your projects as defined in your Playwright config file. The default config when installing Playwright gives you 3 projects, Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. The first project is selected by default.

To run tests on multiple projects, select each project by checking the checkboxes next to the project name. Then when you run your tests from the sidebar or by pressing the play button next to the test name, the tests will run on all the selected projects.

You can also individually run a test on a specific project by clicking the grey play button next to the project name of the test.

Run tests with trace viewer
For a better developer experience you can run your tests with the Show Trace Viewer option.

This will open up a full trace of your test where you can step through each action of your tests, explore the timeline, source code and more.

To learn more about the trace viewer see our Trace Viewer guide.
Debugging tests
With the VS Code extension you can debug your tests right in VS Code see error messages, create breakpoints and live debug your tests.
Error messages
If your test fails VS Code will show you error messages right in the editor showing what was expected, what was received as well as a complete call log.

Live debugging
You can debug your test live in VS Code. After running a test with the Show Browser option checked, click on any of the locators in VS Code and it will be highlighted in the Browser window. Playwright will highlight it if it exists and show you if there is more than one result

You can also edit the locators in VS Code and Playwright will show you the changes live in the browser window.
Run in debug mode
To set a breakpoint click next to the line number where you want the breakpoint to be until a red dot appears. Run the tests in debug mode by right clicking on the line next to the test you want to run.

A browser window will open and the test will run and pause at where the breakpoint is set. You can step through the tests, pause the test and rerun the tests from the menu in VS Code.


To learn more about debugging, see Debugging in Visual Studio Code.
Debug with trace viewer
For a better developer experience you can debug your tests with the Show Trace Viewer option.

This will open up a full trace of your test where you can step through each action and see what happened before and after the action. You can also inspect the DOM snapshot, see console logs, network requests, the source code and more.

To learn more about the trace viewer see our Trace Viewer guide.
Generating tests
CodeGen will auto generate your tests for you as you perform actions in the browser and is a great way to quickly get started. The viewport for the browser window is set to a specific width and height. See the configuration guide to change the viewport or emulate different environments.
Record a new test
To record a test click on the Record new button from the Testing sidebar. This will create a test-1.spec.ts file as well as open up a browser window. In the browser go to the URL you wish to test and start clicking around. Playwright will record your actions and generate the test code directly in VS Code. You can also generate assertions by choosing one of the icons in the toolbar and then clicking on an element on the page to assert against. The following assertions can be generated:
'assert visibility' to assert that an element is visible
'assert text' to assert that an element contains specific text
'assert value' to assert that an element has a specific value
Once you are done recording click the cancel button or close the browser window. You can then inspect your test-1.spec.ts file and see your generated test.

Record at cursor
To record from a specific point in your test file click the Record at cursor button from the Testing sidebar. This generates actions into the existing test at the current cursor position. You can run the test, position the cursor at the end of the test and continue generating the test.

Picking a locator
Pick a locator and copy it into your test file by clicking the Pick locator button form the testing sidebar. Then in the browser click the element you require and it will now show up in the Pick locator box in VS Code. Press 'enter' on your keyboard to copy the locator into the clipboard and then paste anywhere in your code. Or press 'escape' if you want to cancel.

Playwright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing role, text and test id locators. If the generator finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient and uniquely identify the target element, so you don't have to worry about failing tests due to locators.
Project Dependencies
You can use project dependencies to run tests that depend on other tests. This is useful for setup tests such as logging in to a website.
Running setup tests
To run your setup tests select the setup project, as defined in your configuration file, from the project section in the Playwright sidebar. This will give you access to the setup tests in the test explorer.

When you run a test that depends on the setup tests, the setup test will run first. Each time you run the test, the setup test will run again.

Running setup tests only once
To run the setup test only once, deselect it from the projects section in the Playwright sidebar. The setup test is now removed from the test explorer. When you run a test that depends on the setup test, it will no longer run the setup test, making it much faster and therefore a much better developer experience.

Global Setup
Global setup runs when you execute your first test. It runs only once and is useful for setting up a database or starting a server. You can manually run global setup by clicking the Run global setup option from the Setup section in the Playwright sidebar. Global teardown does not run by default; you need to manually initiate it by clicking the Run global teardown option.
Global setup will re-run when you debug tests as this ensures an isolated environment and dedicated setup for the test.

Multiple configurations
If your project contains more than one playwright configuration file, you can switch between them by first clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner of the Playwright sidebar. This will show you all the configuration files in your project. Select the configuration files you want to use by checking the checkbox next to each one and clicking on the 'ok' button.

You will now have access to all your tests in the test explorer. To run a test click on the grey triangle next to the file or project name.

To run all tests from all configurations click on the grey triangle at the top of the test explorer.

To choose a configuration file to work with simply toggle between them by clicking on the configuration file name in the Playwright sidebar. Now when you use the tools, such as Record a test, it will record a test for the selected configuration file.

You can easily toggle back and forth between configurations by clicking on the configuration file name in the Playwright sidebar.

New cookie property partitionKey in browserContext.cookies() and browserContext.addCookies(). This property allows to save and restore partitioned cookies. See CHIPS MDN article for more information. Note that browsers have different support and defaults for cookie partitioning.
New option noSnippets to disable code snippets in the html report.
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [['html', { noSnippets: true }]]
});


New property location in test annotations, for example in testResult.annotations and testInfo.annotations. It shows where the annotation like test.skip or test.fixme was added.
Command Line
New option --user-data-dir in multiple commands. You can specify the same user data dir to reuse browsing state, like authentication, between sessions.
npx playwright codegen --user-data-dir=./user-data
Option -gv has been removed from the npx playwright test command. Use --grep-invert instead.
npx playwright open does not open the test recorder anymore. Use npx playwright codegen instead.
Miscellaneous
Support for Node.js 16 has been removed.
Support for Node.js 18 has been deprecated, and will be removed in the future.
Browser Versions
Chromium 139.0.7258.5
Mozilla Firefox 140.0.2
WebKit 26.0
This version was also tested against the following stable channels:
Google Chrome 140
Microsoft Edge 140
Version 1.53
Trace Viewer and HTML Reporter Updates
New Steps in Trace Viewer and HTML reporter: 
New option in 'html' reporter to set the title of a specific test run:
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [['html', { title: 'Custom test run #1028' }]]
});


Miscellaneous
New option kind in testInfo.snapshotPath() controls which snapshot path template is used.
New method locator.describe() to describe a locator. Used for trace viewer and reports.
const button = page.getByTestId('btn-sub').describe('Subscribe button');
await button.click();


npx playwright install --list will now list all installed browsers, versions and locations.
Browser Versions
Chromium 138.0.7204.4
Mozilla Firefox 139.0
WebKit 18.5
This version was also tested against the following stable channels:
Google Chrome 137
Microsoft Edge 137
Version 1.52
Highlights
New method expect(locator).toContainClass() to ergonomically assert individual class names on the element.
await expect(page.getByRole('listitem', { name: 'Ship v1.52' })).toContainClass('done');
Aria Snapshots got two new properties: /children for strict matching and /url for links.
await expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot(`
 - list
    - /children: equal
    - listitem: Feature A
    - listitem:
      - link "Feature B":
        - /url: "https://playwright.dev"
`);


Test Runner
New property testProject.workers allows to specify the number of concurrent worker processes to use for a test project. The global limit of property testConfig.workers still applies.
New testConfig.failOnFlakyTests option to fail the test run if any flaky tests are detected, similarly to --fail-on-flaky-tests. This is useful for CI/CD environments where you want to ensure that all tests are stable before deploying.
New property testResult.annotations contains annotations for each test retry.
Miscellaneous
New option maxRedirects in apiRequest.newContext() to control the maximum number of redirects.
New option ref in locator.ariaSnapshot() to generate reference for each element in the snapshot which can later be used to locate the element.
HTML reporter now supports NOT filtering via !@my-tag or !my-file.spec.ts or !p:my-project.
Breaking Changes
Glob URL patterns in methods like page.route() do not support ? and [] anymore. We recommend using regular expressions instead.
Method route.continue() does not allow to override the Cookie header anymore. If a Cookie header is provided, it will be ignored, and the cookie will be loaded from the browser's cookie store. To set custom cookies, use browserContext.addCookies().
macOS 13 is now deprecated and will no longer receive WebKit updates. Please upgrade to a more recent macOS version to continue benefiting from the latest WebKit improvements.
Browser Versions
Chromium 136.0.7103.25
Mozilla Firefox 137.0
WebKit 18.4
This version was also tested against the following stable channels:
Google Chrome 135
Microsoft Edge 135
Version 1.51
StorageState for indexedDB
New option indexedDB for browserContext.storageState() allows to save and restore IndexedDB contents. Useful when your application uses IndexedDB API to store authentication tokens, like Firebase Authentication.
Here is an example following the authentication guide:
tests/auth.setup.ts
import { test as setup, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import path from 'path';

const authFile = path.join(__dirname, '../playwright/.auth/user.json');

setup('authenticate', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  // ... perform authentication steps ...

  // make sure to save indexedDB
  await page.context().storageState({ path: authFile, indexedDB: true });
});


Copy as prompt
New "Copy prompt" button on errors in the HTML report, trace viewer and UI mode. Click to copy a pre-filled LLM prompt that contains the error message and useful context for fixing the error.

Filter visible elements
New option visible for locator.filter() allows matching only visible elements.
example.spec.ts
test('some test', async ({ page }) => {
 // Ignore invisible todo items.
 const todoItems = page.getByTestId('todo-item').filter({ visible: true });
 // Check there are exactly 3 visible ones.
 await expect(todoItems).toHaveCount(3);
});
Git information in HTML report
Set option testConfig.captureGitInfo to capture git information into testConfig.metadata.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 captureGitInfo: { commit: true, diff: true }
});
HTML report will show this information when available:

Test Step improvements
A new TestStepInfo object is now available in test steps. You can add step attachments or skip the step under some conditions.
test('some test', async ({ page, isMobile }) => {
 // Note the new "step" argument:
 await test.step('here is my step', async step => {
   step.skip(isMobile, 'not relevant on mobile layouts');

   // ...
   await step.attach('my attachment', { body: 'some text' });
   // ...
 });
});
Miscellaneous
New option contrast for methods page.emulateMedia() and browser.newContext() allows to emulate the prefers-contrast media feature.
New option failOnStatusCode makes all fetch requests made through the APIRequestContext throw on response codes other than 2xx and 3xx.
Assertion expect(page).toHaveURL() now supports a predicate.
Browser Versions
Chromium 134.0.6998.35
Mozilla Firefox 135.0
WebKit 18.4
This version was also tested against the following stable channels:
Google Chrome 133
Microsoft Edge 133
Version 1.50
Test runner
New option timeout allows specifying a maximum run time for an individual test step. A timed-out step will fail the execution of the test.
test('some test', async ({ page }) => {
 await test.step('a step', async () => {
    // This step can time out separately from the test
  }, { timeout: 1000 });
});


New method test.step.skip() to disable execution of a test step.
test('some test', async ({ page }) => {
 await test.step('before running step', async () => {
    // Normal step
  });

  await test.step.skip('not yet ready', async () => {
    // This step is skipped
  });

  await test.step('after running step', async () => {
    // This step still runs even though the previous one was skipped
  });
});


Expanded expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot() to allow storing of aria snapshots in separate YAML files.
Added method expect(locator).toHaveAccessibleErrorMessage() to assert the Locator points to an element with a given aria errormessage.
Option testConfig.updateSnapshots added the configuration enum changed. changed updates only the snapshots that have changed, whereas all now updates all snapshots, regardless of whether there are any differences.
New option testConfig.updateSourceMethod defines the way source code is updated when testConfig.updateSnapshots is configured. Added overwrite and 3-way modes that write the changes into source code, on top of existing patch mode that creates a patch file.
npx playwright test --update-snapshots=changed --update-source-method=3way
Option testConfig.webServer added a gracefulShutdown field for specifying a process kill signal other than the default SIGKILL.
Exposed testStep.attachments from the reporter API to allow retrieval of all attachments created by that step.
New option pathTemplate for toHaveScreenshot and toMatchAriaSnapshot assertions in the testConfig.expect configuration.
UI updates
Updated default HTML reporter to improve display of attachments.
New button in Codegen for picking elements to produce aria snapshots.
Additional details (such as keys pressed) are now displayed alongside action API calls in traces.
Display of canvas content in traces is error-prone. Display is now disabled by default, and can be enabled via the Display canvas content UI setting.
Call and Network panels now display additional time information.
Breaking
expect(locator).toBeEditable() and locator.isEditable() now throw if the target element is not <input>, <select>, or a number of other editable elements.
Option testConfig.updateSnapshots now updates all snapshots when set to all, rather than only the failed/changed snapshots. Use the new enum changed to keep the old functionality of only updating the changed snapshots.
Browser Versions
Chromium 133.0.6943.16
Mozilla Firefox 134.0
WebKit 18.2
This version was also tested against the following stable channels:
Google Chrome 132
Microsoft Edge 132
Version 1.49
Aria snapshots
New assertion expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot() verifies page structure by comparing to an expected accessibility tree, represented as YAML.
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
await expect(page.locator('body')).toMatchAriaSnapshot(`
 - banner:
   - heading /Playwright enables reliable/ [level=1]
   - link "Get started"
   - link "Star microsoft/playwright on GitHub"
 - main:
   - img "Browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)"
   - heading "Any browser â¢ Any platform â¢ One API"
`);
You can generate this assertion with Test Generator and update the expected snapshot with --update-snapshots command line flag.
Learn more in the aria snapshots guide.
Test runner
New option testConfig.tsconfig allows to specify a single tsconfig to be used for all tests.
New method test.fail.only() to focus on a failing test.
Options testConfig.globalSetup and testConfig.globalTeardown now support multiple setups/teardowns.
New value 'on-first-failure' for testOptions.screenshot.
Added "previous" and "next" buttons to the HTML report to quickly switch between test cases.
New properties testInfoError.cause and testError.cause mirroring Error.cause.
Breaking: chrome and msedge channels switch to new headless mode
This change affects you if you're using one of the following channels in your playwright.config.ts:
chrome, chrome-dev, chrome-beta, or chrome-canary
msedge, msedge-dev, msedge-beta, or msedge-canary
What do I need to do?
After updating to Playwright v1.49, run your test suite. If it still passes, you're good to go. If not, you will probably need to update your snapshots, and adapt some of your test code around PDF viewers and extensions. See issue #33566 for more details.
Other breaking changes
There will be no more updates for WebKit on Ubuntu 20.04 and Debian 11. We recommend updating your OS to a later version.
Package @playwright/experimental-ct-vue2 will no longer be updated.
Package @playwright/experimental-ct-solid will no longer be updated.
Try new Chromium headless
You can opt into the new headless mode by using 'chromium' channel. As official Chrome documentation puts it:
New Headless on the other hand is the real Chrome browser, and is thus more authentic, reliable, and offers more features. This makes it more suitable for high-accuracy end-to-end web app testing or browser extension testing.
See issue #33566 for the list of possible breakages you could encounter and more details on Chromium headless. Please file an issue if you see any problems after opting in.
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'], channel: 'chromium' },
   },
 ],
});
Miscellaneous
<canvas> elements inside a snapshot now draw a preview.
New method tracing.group() to visually group actions in the trace.
Playwright docker images switched from Node.js v20 to Node.js v22 LTS.
Browser Versions
Chromium 131.0.6778.33
Mozilla Firefox 132.0
WebKit 18.2
This version was also tested against the following stable channels:
Google Chrome 130
Microsoft Edge 130
Version 1.48
WebSocket routing
New methods page.routeWebSocket() and browserContext.routeWebSocket() allow to intercept, modify and mock WebSocket connections initiated in the page. Below is a simple example that mocks WebSocket communication by responding to a "request" with a "response".
await page.routeWebSocket('/ws', ws => {
 ws.onMessage(message => {
   if (message === 'request')
     ws.send('response');
 });
});
See WebSocketRoute for more details.
UI updates
New "copy" buttons for annotations and test location in the HTML report.
Route method calls like route.fulfill() are not shown in the report and trace viewer anymore. You can see which network requests were routed in the network tab instead.
New "Copy as cURL" and "Copy as fetch" buttons for requests in the network tab.
Miscellaneous
Option form and similar ones now accept FormData.
New method page.requestGC() may help detect memory leaks.
New option location to pass custom step location.
Requests made by APIRequestContext now record detailed timing and security information in the HAR.
Browser Versions
Chromium 130.0.6723.19
Mozilla Firefox 130.0
WebKit 18.0
This version was also tested against the following stable channels:
Google Chrome 129
Microsoft Edge 129
Version 1.47
Network Tab improvements
The Network tab in the UI mode and trace viewer has several nice improvements:
filtering by asset type and URL
better display of query string parameters
preview of font assets

--tsconfig CLI option
By default, Playwright will look up the closest tsconfig for each imported file using a heuristic. You can now specify a single tsconfig file in the command line, and Playwright will use it for all imported files, not only test files:
# Pass a specific tsconfig
npx playwright test --tsconfig tsconfig.test.json
APIRequestContext now accepts URLSearchParams and string as query parameters
You can now pass URLSearchParams and string as query parameters to APIRequestContext:
test('query params', async ({ request }) => {
 const searchParams = new URLSearchParams();
 searchParams.set('userId', 1);
 const response = await request.get(
     'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',
     {
       params: searchParams // or as a string: 'userId=1'
     }
 );
 // ...
});
Miscellaneous
The mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.47.0 now serves a Playwright image based on Ubuntu 24.04 Noble. To use the 22.04 jammy-based image, please use mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.47.0-jammy instead.
New options behavior, behavior and behavior to wait for ongoing listeners to complete.
TLS client certificates can now be passed from memory by passing clientCertificates.cert and clientCertificates.key as buffers instead of file paths.
Attachments with a text/html content type can now be opened in a new tab in the HTML report. This is useful for including third-party reports or other HTML content in the Playwright test report and distributing it to your team.
noWaitAfter option in locator.selectOption() was deprecated.
We've seen reports of WebGL in Webkit misbehaving on GitHub Actions macos-13. We recommend upgrading GitHub Actions to macos-14.
Browser Versions
Chromium 129.0.6668.29
Mozilla Firefox 130.0
WebKit 18.0
This version was also tested against the following stable channels:
Google Chrome 128
Microsoft Edge 128
Version 1.46
TLS Client Certificates
Playwright now allows you to supply client-side certificates, so that server can verify them, as specified by TLS Client Authentication.
The following snippet sets up a client certificate for https://example.com:
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // ...
 use: {
   clientCertificates: [{
     origin: 'https://example.com',
     certPath: './cert.pem',
     keyPath: './key.pem',
     passphrase: 'mysecretpassword',
   }],
 },
 // ...
});
You can also provide client certificates to a particular test project or as a parameter of browser.newContext() and apiRequest.newContext().
--only-changed cli option
New CLI option --only-changed will only run test files that have been changed since the last git commit or from a specific git "ref". This will also run all test files that import any changed files.
# Only run test files with uncommitted changes
npx playwright test --only-changed

# Only run test files changed relative to the "main" branch
npx playwright test --only-changed=main
Component Testing: New router fixture
This release introduces an experimental router fixture to intercept and handle network requests in component testing. There are two ways to use the router fixture:
Call router.route(url, handler) that behaves similarly to page.route().
Call router.use(handlers) and pass MSW library request handlers to it.
Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.
import { handlers } from '@src/mocks/handlers';

test.beforeEach(async ({ router }) => {
 // install common handlers before each test
 await router.use(...handlers);
});

test('example test', async ({ mount }) => {
 // test as usual, your handlers are active
 // ...
});
This fixture is only available in component tests.
UI Mode / Trace Viewer Updates
Test annotations are now shown in UI mode.
Content of text attachments is now rendered inline in the attachments pane.
New setting to show/hide routing actions like route.continue().
Request method and status are shown in the network details tab.
New button to copy source file location to clipboard.
Metadata pane now displays the baseURL.
Miscellaneous
New maxRetries option in apiRequestContext.fetch() which retries on the ECONNRESET network error.
New option to box a fixture to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error messages.
New option to provide a custom fixture title to be used in test reports and error messages.
Browser Versions
Chromium 128.0.6613.18
Mozilla Firefox 128.0
WebKit 18.0
This version was also tested against the following stable channels:
Google Chrome 127
Microsoft Edge 127
Version 1.45
Clock
Utilizing the new Clock API allows to manipulate and control time within tests to verify time-related behavior. This API covers many common scenarios, including:
testing with predefined time;
keeping consistent time and timers;
monitoring inactivity;
ticking through time manually.
// Initialize clock and let the page load naturally.
await page.clock.install({ time: new Date('2024-02-02T08:00:00') });
await page.goto('http://localhost:3333');

// Pretend that the user closed the laptop lid and opened it again at 10am,
// Pause the time once reached that point.
await page.clock.pauseAt(new Date('2024-02-02T10:00:00'));

// Assert the page state.
await expect(page.getByTestId('current-time')).toHaveText('2/2/2024, 10:00:00 AM');

// Close the laptop lid again and open it at 10:30am.
await page.clock.fastForward('30:00');
await expect(page.getByTestId('current-time')).toHaveText('2/2/2024, 10:30:00 AM');
See the clock guide for more details.
Test runner
New CLI option --fail-on-flaky-tests that sets exit code to 1 upon any flaky tests. Note that by default, the test runner exits with code 0 when all failed tests recovered upon a retry. With this option, the test run will fail in such case.
New environment variable PLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY controls whether built-in list, line and dot reporters assume a live terminal. For example, this could be useful to disable tty behavior when your CI environment does not handle ANSI control sequences well. Alternatively, you can enable tty behavior even when to live terminal is present, if you plan to post-process the output and handle control sequences.
# Avoid TTY features that output ANSI control sequences
PLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY=0 npx playwright test

# Enable TTY features, assuming a terminal width 80
PLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY=80 npx playwright test


New options testConfig.respectGitIgnore and testProject.respectGitIgnore control whether files matching .gitignore patterns are excluded when searching for tests.
New property timeout is now available for custom expect matchers. This property takes into account playwright.config.ts and expect.configure().
import { expect as baseExpect } from '@playwright/test';

export const expect = baseExpect.extend({
  async toHaveAmount(locator: Locator, expected: number, options?: { timeout?: number }) {
    // When no timeout option is specified, use the config timeout.
    const timeout = options?.timeout ?? this.timeout;
    // ... implement the assertion ...
  },
});


Miscellaneous
Method locator.setInputFiles() now supports uploading a directory for <input type=file webkitdirectory> elements.
await page.getByLabel('Upload directory').setInputFiles(path.join(__dirname, 'mydir'));
Multiple methods like locator.click() or locator.press() now support a ControlOrMeta modifier key. This key maps to Meta on macOS and maps to Control on Windows and Linux.
// Press the common keyboard shortcut Control+S or Meta+S to trigger a "Save" operation.
await page.keyboard.press('ControlOrMeta+S');


New property httpCredentials.send in apiRequest.newContext() that allows to either always send the Authorization header or only send it in response to 401 Unauthorized.
New option reason in apiRequestContext.dispose() that will be included in the error message of ongoing operations interrupted by the context disposal.
New option host in browserType.launchServer() allows to accept websocket connections on a specific address instead of unspecified 0.0.0.0.
Playwright now supports Chromium, Firefox and WebKit on Ubuntu 24.04.
v1.45 is the last release to receive WebKit update for macOS 12 Monterey. Please update macOS to keep using the latest WebKit.

New APIs
Accessibility assertions
expect(locator).toHaveAccessibleName() checks if the element has the specified accessible name:
const locator = page.getByRole('button');
await expect(locator).toHaveAccessibleName('Submit');


expect(locator).toHaveAccessibleDescription() checks if the element has the specified accessible description:
const locator = page.getByRole('button');
await expect(locator).toHaveAccessibleDescription('Upload a photo');


expect(locator).toHaveRole() checks if the element has the specified ARIA role:
const locator = page.getByTestId('save-button');
await expect(locator).toHaveRole('button');


Locator handler
After executing the handler added with page.addLocatorHandler(), Playwright will now wait until the overlay that triggered the handler is not visible anymore. You can opt-out of this behavior with the new noWaitAfter option.
You can use new times option in page.addLocatorHandler() to specify maximum number of times the handler should be run.
The handler in page.addLocatorHandler() now accepts the locator as argument.
New page.removeLocatorHandler() method for removing previously added locator handlers.
const locator = page.getByText('This interstitial covers the button');
await page.addLocatorHandler(locator, async overlay => {
 await overlay.locator('#close').click();
}, { times: 3, noWaitAfter: true });
// Run your tests that can be interrupted by the overlay.
// ...
await page.removeLocatorHandler(locator);
Miscellaneous options
multipart option in apiRequestContext.fetch() now accepts FormData and supports repeating fields with the same name.
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', new File(['let x = 2024;'], 'f1.js', { type: 'text/javascript' }));
formData.append('file', new File(['hello'], 'f2.txt', { type: 'text/plain' }));
context.request.post('https://example.com/uploadFiles', {
  multipart: formData
});


expect(callback).toPass({ intervals }) can now be configured by expect.toPass.intervals option globally in testConfig.expect or per project in testProject.expect.
expect(page).toHaveURL(url) now supports ignoreCase option.
testProject.ignoreSnapshots allows to configure per project whether to skip screenshot expectations.
Reporter API
New method suite.entries() returns child test suites and test cases in their declaration order. suite.type and testCase.type can be used to tell apart test cases and suites in the list.
Blob reporter now allows overriding report file path with a single option outputFile. The same option can also be specified as PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_FILE environment variable that might be more convenient on CI/CD.
JUnit reporter now supports includeProjectInTestName option.
Command line
--last-failed CLI option to for running only tests that failed in the previous run.
First run all tests:
$ npx playwright test

Running 103 tests using 5 workers
...

New mode retain-on-first-failure for testOptions.trace. In this mode, trace is recorded for the first run of each test, but not for retires. When test run fails, the trace file is retained, otherwise it is removed.
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    trace: 'retain-on-first-failure',
  },
});


New property testInfo.tags exposes test tags during test execution.
test('example', async ({ page }) => {
 console.log(test.info().tags);
});


New method locator.contentFrame() converts a Locator object to a FrameLocator. This can be useful when you have a Locator object obtained somewhere, and later on would like to interact with the content inside the frame.
const locator = page.locator('iframe[name="embedded"]');
// ...
const frameLocator = locator.contentFrame();
await frameLocator.getByRole('button').click();


New method frameLocator.owner() converts a FrameLocator object to a Locator. This can be useful when you have a FrameLocator object obtained somewhere, and later on would like to interact with the iframe element.
const frameLocator = page.frameLocator('iframe[name="embedded"]');
// ...
const locator = frameLocator.owner();
await expect(locator).toBeVisible();

New method page.addLocatorHandler() registers a callback that will be invoked when specified element becomes visible and may block Playwright actions. The callback can get rid of the overlay. Here is an example that closes a cookie dialog when it appears:
// Setup the handler.
await page.addLocatorHandler(
   page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Hej! You are in control of your cookies.' }),
   async () => {
     await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Accept all' }).click();
   });
// Write the test as usual.
await page.goto('https://www.ikea.com/');
await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Collection of blue and white' }).click();
await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Light and easy' })).toBeVisible();
expect(callback).toPass() timeout can now be configured by expect.toPass.timeout option globally or in project config
electronApplication.on('console') event is emitted when Electron main process calls console API methods.
electronApp.on('console', async msg => {
 const values = [];
 for (const arg of msg.args())
   values.push(await arg.jsonValue());
 console.log(...values);
});
await electronApp.evaluate(() => console.log('hello', 5, { foo: 'bar' }));
New syntax for adding tags to the tests (@-tokens in the test title are still supported):
test('test customer login', {
 tag: ['@fast', '@login'],
}, async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});
Use --grep command line option to run only tests with certain tags.
npx playwright test --grep @fast
--project command line flag now supports '*' wildcard:
npx playwright test --project='*mobile*'
New syntax for test annotations:
test('test full report', {
 annotation: [
   { type: 'issue', description: 'https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/23180' },
   { type: 'docs', description: 'https://playwright.dev/docs/test-annotations#tag-tests' },

Add custom matchers to your expect
You can extend Playwright assertions by providing custom matchers. These matchers will be available on the expect object.
test.spec.ts
import { expect as baseExpect } from '@playwright/test';
export const expect = baseExpect.extend({
 async toHaveAmount(locator: Locator, expected: number, options?: { timeout?: number }) {
   // ... see documentation for how to write matchers.
 },
});

test('pass', async ({ page }) => {
 await expect(page.getByTestId('cart')).toHaveAmount(5);
});
See the documentation for a full example.
Merge test fixtures
You can now merge test fixtures from multiple files or modules:
fixtures.ts
import { mergeTests } from '@playwright/test';
import { test as dbTest } from 'database-test-utils';
import { test as a11yTest } from 'a11y-test-utils';

export const test = mergeTests(dbTest, a11yTest);
test.spec.ts
import { test } from './fixtures';

test('passes', async ({ database, page, a11y }) => {
 // use database and a11y fixtures.
});
Merge custom expect matchers
You can now merge custom expect matchers from multiple files or modules:
fixtures.ts
import { mergeTests, mergeExpects } from '@playwright/test';
import { test as dbTest, expect as dbExpect } from 'database-test-utils';
import { test as a11yTest, expect as a11yExpect } from 'a11y-test-utils';

export const test = mergeTests(dbTest, a11yTest);
export const expect = mergeExpects(dbExpect, a11yExpect);
test.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from './fixtures';

test('passes', async ({ page, database }) => {
 await expect(database).toHaveDatabaseUser('admin');
 await expect(page).toPassA11yAudit();
});
Hide implementation details: box test steps
You can mark a test.step() as "boxed" so that errors inside it point to the step call site.
async function login(page) {
 await test.step('login', async () => {
   // ...
 }, { box: true });  // Note the "box" option here.
}
Error: Timed out 5000ms waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible()

Breaking Changes: Playwright no longer downloads browsers automatically
Note: If you are using @playwright/test package, this change does not affect you.
Playwright recommends to use @playwright/test package and download browsers via npx playwright install command. If you are following this recommendation, nothing has changed for you.
However, up to v1.38, installing the playwright package instead of @playwright/test did automatically download browsers. This is no longer the case, and we recommend to explicitly download browsers via npx playwright install command.
v1.37 and earlier
playwright package was downloading browsers during npm install, while @playwright/test was not.
v1.38 and later
playwright and @playwright/test packages do not download browsers during npm install.
Recommended migration
Run npx playwright install to download browsers after npm install. For example, in your CI configuration:
- run: npm ci
- run: npx playwright install --with-deps
Alternative migration option - not recommended
Add @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox and @playwright/browser-webkit as a dependency. These packages download respective browsers during npm install. Make sure you keep the version of all playwright packages in sync:
// package.json
{
 "devDependencies": {
   "playwright": "1.38.0",
   "@playwright/browser-chromium": "1.38.0",
   "@playwright/browser-firefox": "1.38.0",

New npx playwright merge-reports tool
If you run tests on multiple shards, you can now merge all reports in a single HTML report (or any other report) using the new merge-reports CLI tool.
Using merge-reports tool requires the following steps:
Adding a new "blob" reporter to the config when running on CI:
playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
 testDir: './tests',
  reporter: process.env.CI ? 'blob' : 'html',
});


The "blob" reporter will produce ".zip" files that contain all the information about the test run.
Copying all "blob" reports in a single shared location and running npx playwright merge-reports:
npx playwright merge-reports --reporter html ./all-blob-reports

UI Mode now shows steps, fixtures and attachments: 
New property testProject.teardown to specify a project that needs to run after this and all dependent projects have finished. Teardown is useful to cleanup any resources acquired by this project.
A common pattern would be a setup dependency with a corresponding teardown:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'setup',
      testMatch: /global.setup\.ts/,
      teardown: 'teardown',

      use: devices['Desktop Chrome'],
      dependencies: ['setup'],
    },

      name: 'firefox',
      use: devices['Desktop Firefox'],
      dependencies: ['setup'],
    },
    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: devices['Desktop Safari'],
      dependencies: ['setup'],
    },
  ],
});


New method expect.configure to create pre-configured expect instance with its own defaults such as timeout and soft.
const slowExpect = expect.configure({ timeout: 10000 });
await slowExpect(locator).toHaveText('Submit');

// Always do soft assertions.
const softExpect = expect.configure({ soft: true });


New options stderr and stdout in testConfig.webServer to configure output handling:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Run your local dev server before starting the tests
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    stdout: 'pipe',
    stderr: 'pipe',
  },
});


New locator.and() to create a locator that matches both locators.
const button = page.getByRole('button').and(page.getByTitle('Subscribe'));
New events browserContext.on('console') and browserContext.on('dialog') to subscribe to any dialogs and console messages from any page from the given browser context. Use the new methods consoleMessage.page() and dialog.page() to pin-point event source.
â ï¸ Breaking changes
npx playwright test no longer works if you install both playwright and @playwright/test. There's no need to install both, since you can always import browser automation APIs from @playwright/test directly:
automation.ts
import { chromium, firefox, webkit } from '@playwright/test';

Locators Update
Use locator.or() to create a locator that matches either of the two locators. Consider a scenario where you'd like to click on a "New email" button, but sometimes a security settings dialog shows up instead. In this case, you can wait for either a "New email" button, or a dialog and act accordingly:
const newEmail = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'New email' });
const dialog = page.getByText('Confirm security settings');
await expect(newEmail.or(dialog)).toBeVisible();
if (await dialog.isVisible())
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Dismiss' }).click();
await newEmail.click();


Use new options hasNot and hasNotText in locator.filter() to find elements that do not match certain conditions.
const rowLocator = page.locator('tr');
await rowLocator
    .filter({ hasNotText: 'text in column 1' })
    .filter({ hasNot: page.getByRole('button', { name: 'column 2 button' }) })
    .screenshot();


Use new web-first assertion expect(locator).toBeAttached() to ensure that the element is present in the page's DOM. Do not confuse with the expect(locator).toBeVisible() that ensures that element is both attached & visible.

    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: devices['Desktop Safari'],
      dependencies: ['setup'],
    },
  ],
});


New assertion expect(locator).toBeInViewport() ensures that locator points to an element that intersects viewport, according to the intersection observer API.
const button = page.getByRole('button');

// Make sure at least some part of element intersects viewport.
await expect(button).toBeInViewport();

// Make sure element is fully outside of viewport.
await expect(button).not.toBeInViewport();

// Make sure that at least half of the element intersects viewport.
await expect(button).toBeInViewport({ ratio: 0.5 });


Miscellaneous
DOM snapshots in trace viewer can be now opened in a separate window.
New method defineConfig to be used in playwright.config.
New option maxRedirects for method route.fetch().
Playwright now supports Debian 11 arm64.
Official docker images now include Node 18 instead of Node 16.
â ï¸ Breaking change in component tests

 const response = await page.request.get('https://api.example.com');
  await expect(response).toBeOK();
}).toPass();

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:
Google Chrome 108
Microsoft Edge 108
Version 1.28
Playwright Tools
Record at Cursor in VSCode. You can run the test, position the cursor at the end of the test and continue generating the test.

Live Locators in VSCode. You can hover and edit locators in VSCode to get them highlighted in the opened browser.
Live Locators in CodeGen. Generate a locator for any element on the page using "Explore" tool.

Codegen and Trace Viewer Dark Theme. Automatically picked up from operating system settings.

Test Runner
Configure retries and test timeout for a file or a test with test.describe.configure().
// Each test in the file will be retried twice and have a timeout of 20 seconds.
test.describe.configure({ retries: 2, timeout: 20_000 });
test('runs first', async ({ page }) => {});
test('runs second', async ({ page }) => {});


Use testProject.snapshotPathTemplate and testConfig.snapshotPathTemplate to configure a template controlling location of snapshots generated by expect(page).toHaveScreenshot() and expect(value).toMatchSnapshot().
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  snapshotPathTemplate: '{testDir}/__screenshots__/{testFilePath}/{arg}{ext}',
});

Locators
With these new APIs writing locators is a joy:
page.getByText() to locate by text content.
page.getByRole() to locate by ARIA role, ARIA attributes and accessible name.
page.getByLabel() to locate a form control by associated label's text.
page.getByTestId() to locate an element based on its data-testid attribute (other attribute can be configured).
page.getByPlaceholder() to locate an input by placeholder.
page.getByAltText() to locate an element, usually image, by its text alternative.
page.getByTitle() to locate an element by its title.
await page.getByLabel('User Name').fill('John');

await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('secret-password');

await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();

await expect(page.getByText('Welcome, John!')).toBeVisible();
All the same methods are also available on Locator, FrameLocator and Frame classes.
Other highlights
workers option in the playwright.config.ts now accepts a percentage string to use some of the available CPUs. You can also pass it in the command line:
npx playwright test --workers=20%
New options host and port for the html reporter.
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [['html', { host: 'localhost', port: '9223' }]],
});


New field FullConfig.configFile is available to test reporters, specifying the path to the config file if any.
As announced in v1.25, Ubuntu 18 will not be supported as of Dec 2022. In addition to that, there will be no WebKit updates on Ubuntu 18 starting from the next Playwright release.
Behavior Changes
expect(locator).toHaveAttribute() with an empty value does not match missing attribute anymore. For example, the following snippet will succeed when button does not have a disabled attribute.
await expect(page.getByRole('button')).toHaveAttribute('disabled', '');
Command line options --grep and --grep-invert previously incorrectly ignored grep and grepInvert options specified in the config. Now all of them are applied together.

Assertions
New option enabled for expect(locator).toBeEnabled().
expect(locator).toHaveText() now pierces open shadow roots.
New option editable for expect(locator).toBeEditable().
New option visible for expect(locator).toBeVisible().
Other highlights
New option maxRedirects for apiRequestContext.get() and others to limit redirect count.
New command-line flag --pass-with-no-tests that allows the test suite to pass when no files are found.
New command-line flag --ignore-snapshots to skip snapshot expectations, such as expect(value).toMatchSnapshot() and expect(page).toHaveScreenshot().
Behavior Change
A bunch of Playwright APIs already support the waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' option. For example:
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev', {
 waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded',
});
Prior to 1.26, this would wait for all iframes to fire the DOMContentLoaded event.
To align with web specification, the 'domcontentloaded' value only waits for the target frame to fire the 'DOMContentLoaded' event. Use waitUntil: 'load' to wait for all iframes.

ð Multiple Web Servers in playwright.config.ts
Launch multiple web servers, databases, or other processes by passing an array of configurations:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 webServer: [
   {
     command: 'npm run start',
     url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
     timeout: 120 * 1000,

     reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
   }
 ],
 use: {
   baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000/',
 },
});
ð Debian 11 Bullseye Support
Playwright now supports Debian 11 Bullseye on x86_64 for Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. Let us know if you encounter any issues!
Linux support looks like this:
| | Ubuntu 20.04 | Ubuntu 22.04 | Debian 11 | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | | Chromium | â | â | â | | WebKit | â | â | â | | Firefox | â | â | â |
ðµï¸ Anonymous Describe
It is now possible to call test.describe() to create suites without a title. This is useful for giving a group of tests a common option with test.use().
test.describe(() => {
 test.use({ colorScheme: 'dark' });

 test('one', async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });

 test('two', async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });
});
ð§© Component Tests Update
Playwright 1.24 Component Tests introduce beforeMount and afterMount hooks. Use these to configure your app for tests.
For example, this could be used to setup App router in Vue.js:
src/component.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-vue';
import { Component } from './mycomponent';

test('should work', async ({ mount }) => {
 const component = await mount(Component, {
   hooksConfig: {
     /* anything to configure your app */
   }
 });
});
playwright/index.ts
import { router } from '../router';
import { beforeMount } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-vue/hooks';

beforeMount(async ({ app, hooksConfig }) => {
 app.use(router);
});
A similar configuration in Next.js would look like this:
src/component.spec.jsx
import { test } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';
import { Component } from './mycomponent';

test('should work', async ({ mount }) => {
 const component = await mount(<Component></Component>, {
   // Pass mock value from test into `beforeMount`.
   hooksConfig: {
     router: {
       query: { page: 1, per_page: 10 },
       asPath: '/posts'
     }
   }
 });
});
playwright/index.js
import router from 'next/router';
import { beforeMount } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react/hooks';

beforeMount(async ({ hooksConfig }) => {
 // Before mount, redefine useRouter to return mock value from test.
 router.useRouter = () => hooksConfig.router;
});
Version 1.23
Network Replay
Now you can record network traffic into a HAR file and re-use this traffic in your tests.
To record network into HAR file:
npx playwright open --save-har=github.har.zip https://github.com/microsoft
Alternatively, you can record HAR programmatically:
const context = await browser.newContext({
 recordHar: { path: 'github.har.zip' }
});
// ... do stuff ...
await context.close();
Use the new methods page.routeFromHAR() or browserContext.routeFromHAR() to serve matching responses from the HAR file:
await context.routeFromHAR('github.har.zip');
Read more in our documentation.
Advanced Routing
You can now use route.fallback() to defer routing to other handlers.
Consider the following example:
// Remove a header from all requests.
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
 await page.route('**/*', async route => {
   const headers = await route.request().allHeaders();
   delete headers['if-none-match'];
   await route.fallback({ headers });
 });
});

test('should work', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.route('**/*', async route => {
   if (route.request().resourceType() === 'image')
     await route.abort();
   else
     await route.fallback();
 });
});
Note that the new methods page.routeFromHAR() and browserContext.routeFromHAR() also participate in routing and could be deferred to.
Web-First Assertions Update
New method expect(locator).toHaveValues() that asserts all selected values of <select multiple> element.
Methods expect(locator).toContainText() and expect(locator).toHaveText() now accept ignoreCase option.
Component Tests Update
Support for Vue2 via the @playwright/experimental-ct-vue2 package.
Support for component tests for create-react-app with components in .js files.
Read more about component testing with Playwright.
Miscellaneous
If there's a service worker that's in your way, you can now easily disable it with a new context option serviceWorkers:
playwright.config.ts
export default {
 use: {
    serviceWorkers: 'block',
  }
};


Using .zip path for recordHar context option automatically zips the resulting HAR:
const context = await browser.newContext({
 recordHar: {
    path: 'github.har.zip',
  }
});


If you intend to edit HAR by hand, consider using the "minimal" HAR recording mode that only records information that is essential for replaying:
const context = await browser.newContext({
 recordHar: {
    path: 'github.har',
    mode: 'minimal',
  }
});


Playwright now runs on Ubuntu 22 amd64 and Ubuntu 22 arm64. We also publish new docker image mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.34.0-jammy.
â ï¸ Breaking Changes â ï¸
WebServer is now considered "ready" if request to the specified url has any of the following HTTP status codes:
200-299
300-399 (new)
400, 401, 402, 403 (new)
Version 1.22
Highlights
Components Testing (preview)
Playwright Test can now test your React, Vue.js or Svelte components. You can use all the features of Playwright Test (such as parallelization, emulation & debugging) while running components in real browsers.
Here is what a typical component test looks like:
App.spec.tsx
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';
import App from './App';

// Let's test component in a dark scheme!
test.use({ colorScheme: 'dark' });

test('should render', async ({ mount }) => {
  const component = await mount(<App></App>);

  // As with any Playwright test, assert locator text.
  await expect(component).toContainText('React');
  // Or do a screenshot ð
  await expect(component).toHaveScreenshot();
  // Or use any Playwright method
  await component.click();
});


Read more in our documentation.
Role selectors that allow selecting elements by their ARIA role, ARIA attributes and accessible name.
// Click a button with accessible name "log in"
await page.locator('role=button[name="log in"]').click();


Read more in our documentation.
New locator.filter() API to filter an existing locator
const buttons = page.locator('role=button');
// ...
const submitButton = buttons.filter({ hasText: 'Submit' });
await submitButton.click();


New web-first assertions expect(page).toHaveScreenshot() and expect(locator).toHaveScreenshot() that wait for screenshot stabilization and enhances test reliability.
The new assertions has screenshot-specific defaults, such as:
disables animations
uses CSS scale option
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot();


The new expect(page).toHaveScreenshot() saves screenshots at the same location as expect(value).toMatchSnapshot().
Version 1.21
Highlights
New role selectors that allow selecting elements by their ARIA role, ARIA attributes and accessible name.
// Click a button with accessible name "log in"
await page.locator('role=button[name="log in"]').click();


Read more in our documentation.
New scale option in page.screenshot() for smaller sized screenshots.
New caret option in page.screenshot() to control text caret. Defaults to "hide".
New method expect.poll to wait for an arbitrary condition:
// Poll the method until it returns an expected result.
await expect.poll(async () => {
  const response = await page.request.get('https://api.example.com');
  return response.status();
}).toBe(200);


expect.poll supports most synchronous matchers, like .toBe(), .toContain(), etc. Read more in our documentation.
Behavior Changes
ESM support when running TypeScript tests is now enabled by default. The PLAYWRIGHT_EXPERIMENTAL_TS_ESM env variable is no longer required.
The mcr.microsoft.com/playwright docker image no longer contains Python. Please use mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python as a Playwright-ready docker image with pre-installed Python.
Playwright now supports large file uploads (100s of MBs) via locator.setInputFiles() API.
Browser Versions
Chromium 101.0.4951.26
Mozilla Firefox 98.0.2
WebKit 15.4
This version was also tested against the following stable channels:
Google Chrome 100
Microsoft Edge 100
Version 1.20
Highlights
New options for methods page.screenshot(), locator.screenshot() and elementHandle.screenshot():
Option animations: "disabled" rewinds all CSS animations and transitions to a consistent state
Option mask: Locator[] masks given elements, overlaying them with pink #FF00FF boxes.
expect().toMatchSnapshot() now supports anonymous snapshots: when snapshot name is missing, Playwright Test will generate one automatically:
expect('Web is Awesome <3').toMatchSnapshot();
New maxDiffPixels and maxDiffPixelRatio options for fine-grained screenshot comparison using expect().toMatchSnapshot():
expect(await page.screenshot()).toMatchSnapshot({
 maxDiffPixels: 27, // allow no more than 27 different pixels.
});


It is most convenient to specify maxDiffPixels or maxDiffPixelRatio once in testConfig.expect.
Playwright Test now adds testConfig.fullyParallel mode. By default, Playwright Test parallelizes between files. In fully parallel mode, tests inside a single file are also run in parallel. You can also use --fully-parallel command line flag.
playwright.config.ts
export default {
 fullyParallel: true,
};


testProject.grep and testProject.grepInvert are now configurable per project. For example, you can now configure smoke tests project using grep:
playwright.config.ts
export default {
 projects: [
    {
      name: 'smoke tests',
      grep: /@smoke/,
    },
  ],
};


Trace Viewer now shows API testing requests.
locator.highlight() visually reveals element(s) for easier debugging.

Playwright Test Update
Playwright Test v1.19 now supports soft assertions. Failed soft assertions
do not terminate test execution, but mark the test as failed.
// Make a few checks that will not stop the test when failed...
await expect.soft(page.locator('#status')).toHaveText('Success');
await expect.soft(page.locator('#eta')).toHaveText('1 day');

// ... and continue the test to check more things.
await page.locator('#next-page').click();
await expect.soft(page.locator('#title')).toHaveText('Make another order');


Read more in our documentation
You can now specify a custom expect message as a second argument to the expect and expect.soft functions, for example:
await expect(page.locator('text=Name'), 'should be logged in').toBeVisible();
The error would look like this:
   Error: should be logged in


   Call log:
     - expect.toBeVisible with timeout 5000ms
     - waiting for "getByText('Name')"

By default, tests in a single file are run in order. If you have many independent tests in a single file, you can now run them in parallel with test.describe.configure().
Other Updates
Locator now supports a has option that makes sure it contains another locator inside:
await page.locator('article', {
 has: page.locator('.highlight'),
}).click();


Read more in locator documentation
New locator.page()
page.screenshot() and locator.screenshot() now automatically hide blinking caret
Playwright Codegen now generates locators and frame locators
New option url in testConfig.webServer to ensure your web server is ready before running the tests
New testInfo.errors and testResult.errors that contain all failed assertions and soft assertions.
Potentially breaking change in Playwright Test Global Setup
It is unlikely that this change will affect you, no action is required if your tests keep running as they did.
We've noticed that in rare cases, the set of tests to be executed was configured in the global setup by means of the environment variables. We also noticed some applications that were post processing the reporters' output in the global teardown. If you are doing one of the two, learn more

Read more in locator documentation
Testing API improvements
expect(response).toBeOK()
testInfo.attach()
test.info()
Improved TypeScript Support
Playwright Test now respects tsconfig.json's baseUrl and paths, so you can use aliases
There is a new environment variable PW_EXPERIMENTAL_TS_ESM that allows importing ESM modules in your TS code, without the need for the compile step. Don't forget the .js suffix when you are importing your esm modules. Run your tests as follows:
npm i --save-dev @playwright/test@1.18.0-rc1
PW_EXPERIMENTAL_TS_ESM=1 npx playwright test
Create Playwright
The npm init playwright command is now generally available for your use:
# Run from your project's root directory
npm init playwright@latest
# Or create a new project
npm init playwright@latest new-project
This will create a Playwright Test configuration file, optionally add examples, a GitHub Action workflow and a first test example.spec.ts.
New APIs & changes
new testCase.repeatEachIndex API
acceptDownloads option now defaults to true
Breaking change: custom config options
Custom config options are a convenient way to parametrize projects with different values. Learn more in this guide.
Previously, any fixture introduced through test.extend() could be overridden in the testProject.use config section. For example,
// WRONG: THIS SNIPPET DOES NOT WORK SINCE v1.18.

// fixtures.js
const test = base.extend({
 myParameter: 'default',
});

// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
 use: {
   myParameter: 'value',
 },
};
The proper way to make a fixture parametrized in the config file is to specify option: true when defining the fixture. For example,
// CORRECT: THIS SNIPPET WORKS SINCE v1.18.

// fixtures.js
const test = base.extend({
 // Fixtures marked as "option: true" will get a value specified in the config,
 // or fallback to the default value.
 myParameter: ['default', { option: true }],
});

// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
 use: {
   myParameter: 'value',
 },
};

Frame Locators
Playwright 1.17 introduces frame locators - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the iframe and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for iframe to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.

Frame locators can be created with either page.frameLocator() or locator.frameLocator() method.
const locator = page.frameLocator('#my-iframe').locator('text=Submit');
await locator.click();
Read more at our documentation.
Trace Viewer Update
Playwright Trace Viewer is now available online at https://trace.playwright.dev! Just drag-and-drop your trace.zip file to inspect its contents.
NOTE: trace files are not uploaded anywhere; trace.playwright.dev is a progressive web application that processes traces locally.
Playwright Test traces now include sources by default (these could be turned off with tracing option)
Trace Viewer now shows test name
New trace metadata tab with browser details
Snapshots now have URL bar

HTML Report Update
HTML report now supports dynamic filtering
Report is now a single static HTML file that could be sent by e-mail or as a slack attachment.

Ubuntu ARM64 support + more
Playwright now supports Ubuntu 20.04 ARM64. You can now run Playwright tests inside Docker on Apple M1 and on Raspberry Pi.
You can now use Playwright to install stable version of Edge on Linux:
npx playwright install msedge
New APIs
Tracing now supports a 'title' option
Page navigations support a new 'commit' waiting option
HTML reporter got new configuration options
testConfig.snapshotDir option
testInfo.parallelIndex
testInfo.titlePath
testOptions.trace has new options
expect.toMatchSnapshot supports subdirectories
reporter.printsToStdio()
Version 1.16
ð­ Playwright Test
API Testing
Playwright 1.16 introduces new API Testing that lets you send requests to the server directly from Node.js! Now you can:
test your server API
prepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test
validate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser
To do a request on behalf of Playwright's Page, use new page.request API:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('context fetch', async ({ page }) => {
 // Do a GET request on behalf of page
 const response = await page.request.get('http://example.com/foo.json');
 // ...
});
To do a stand-alone request from node.js to an API endpoint, use new request fixture:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('context fetch', async ({ request }) => {
 // Do a GET request on behalf of page
 const response = await request.get('http://example.com/foo.json');
 // ...
});
Read more about it in our API testing guide.
Response Interception
It is now possible to do response interception by combining API Testing with request interception.
For example, we can blur all the images on the page:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import jimp from 'jimp'; // image processing library

test('response interception', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.route('**/*.jpeg', async route => {
   const response = await page._request.fetch(route.request());
   const image = await jimp.read(await response.body());
   await image.blur(5);
   await route.fulfill({
     response,
     body: await image.getBufferAsync('image/jpeg'),
   });
 });
 const response = await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
 expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
});
Read more about response interception.
New HTML reporter
Try it out new HTML reporter with either --reporter=html or a reporter entry in playwright.config.ts file:
$ npx playwright test --reporter=html
The HTML reporter has all the information about tests and their failures, including surfacing trace and image artifacts.

Read more about our reporters.
ð­ Playwright Library
locator.waitFor
Wait for a locator to resolve to a single element with a given state. Defaults to the state: 'visible'.
Comes especially handy when working with lists:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('context fetch', async ({ page }) => {
 const completeness = page.locator('text=Success');
 await completeness.waitFor();
 expect(await page.screenshot()).toMatchSnapshot('screen.png');
});

ð Forced-Colors emulation
Its now possible to emulate the forced-colors CSS media feature by passing it in the browser.newContext() or calling page.emulateMedia().
New APIs
page.route() accepts new times option to specify how many times this route should be matched.
page.setChecked() and locator.setChecked() were introduced to set the checked state of a checkbox.
request.sizes() Returns resource size information for given http request.
tracing.startChunk() - Start a new trace chunk.
tracing.stopChunk() - Stops a new trace chunk.
ð­ Playwright Test
ð¤ test.parallel() run tests in the same file in parallel
test.describe.parallel('group', () => {
 test('runs in parallel 1', async ({ page }) => {
 });
 test('runs in parallel 2', async ({ page }) => {
 });
});
By default, tests in a single file are run in order. If you have many independent tests in a single file, you can now run them in parallel with test.describe.parallel(title, callback).
ð  Add --debug CLI flag
By using npx playwright test --debug it will enable the Playwright Inspector for you to debug your tests.

Version 1.14
ð­ Playwright Library
â¡ï¸ New "strict" mode
Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. "strict" mode ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.
Pass strict: true into your action calls to opt in.
// This will throw if you have more than one button!
await page.click('button', { strict: true });
ð New Locators API
Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.
The difference between the Locator and ElementHandle is that the latter points to a particular element, while Locator captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.
Also, locators are "strict" by default!
const locator = page.locator('button');
await locator.click();
Learn more in the documentation.
ð§© Experimental React and Vue selector engines
React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to attribute selectors and supports all attribute selector operators.
await page.locator('_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]').click();
await page.locator('_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]').click();
Learn more in the react selectors documentation and the vue selectors documentation.
â¨ New nth and visible selector engines
nth selector engine is equivalent to the :nth-match pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
visible selector engine is equivalent to the :visible pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
// select the first button among all buttons
await button.click('button >> nth=0');
// or if you are using locators, you can use first(), nth() and last()
await page.locator('button').first().click();

// click a visible button
await button.click('button >> visible=true');
ð­ Playwright Test
â Web-First Assertions
expect now supports lots of new web-first assertions.
Consider the following example:
await expect(page.locator('.status')).toHaveText('Submitted');
Playwright Test will be re-testing the node with the selector .status until fetched Node has the "Submitted" text. It will be re-fetching the node and checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is reached. You can either pass this timeout or configure it once via the testProject.expect value in test config.
By default, the timeout for assertions is not set, so it'll wait forever, until the whole test times out.
List of all new assertions:
expect(locator).toBeChecked()
expect(locator).toBeDisabled()
expect(locator).toBeEditable()
expect(locator).toBeEmpty()
expect(locator).toBeEnabled()
expect(locator).toBeFocused()
expect(locator).toBeHidden()
expect(locator).toBeVisible()
expect(locator).toContainText(text, options?)
expect(locator).toHaveAttribute(name, value)
expect(locator).toHaveClass(expected)
expect(locator).toHaveCount(count)
expect(locator).toHaveCSS(name, value)
expect(locator).toHaveId(id)
expect(locator).toHaveJSProperty(name, value)
expect(locator).toHaveText(expected, options)
expect(page).toHaveTitle(title)
expect(page).toHaveURL(url)
expect(locator).toHaveValue(value)
â Serial mode with describe.serial
Declares a group of tests that should always be run serially. If one of the tests fails, all subsequent tests are skipped. All tests in a group are retried together.
test.describe.serial('group', () => {
 test('runs first', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
 test('runs second', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
});
Learn more in the documentation.
ð¾ Steps API with test.step
Split long tests into multiple steps using test.step() API:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
 await test.step('Log in', async () => {
   // ...
 });
 await test.step('news feed', async () => {
   // ...
 });
});
Step information is exposed in reporters API.
ð Launch web server before running tests
To launch a server during the tests, use the webServer option in the configuration file. The server will wait for a given url to be available before running the tests, and the url will be passed over to Playwright as a baseURL when creating a context.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 webServer: {
   command: 'npm run start', // command to launch
   url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000', // url to await for
   timeout: 120 * 1000,
   reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
 },
});

â¡ï¸ Introducing Playwright Test
Playwright Test is a new test runner built from scratch by Playwright team specifically to accommodate end-to-end testing needs:
Run tests across all browsers.
Execute tests in parallel.
Enjoy context isolation and sensible defaults out of the box.
Capture videos, screenshots and other artifacts on failure.
Integrate your POMs as extensible fixtures.
Installation:
npm i -D @playwright/test
Simple test tests/foo.spec.ts:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
 const name = await page.innerText('.navbar__title');
 expect(name).toBe('Playwright');
});
Running:
npx playwright test
ð Read more in Playwright Test documentation.
ð§ââï¸ Introducing Playwright Trace Viewer
Playwright Trace Viewer is a new GUI tool that helps exploring recorded Playwright traces after the script ran. Playwright traces let you examine:
page DOM before and after each Playwright action
page rendering before and after each Playwright action
browser network during script execution
Traces are recorded using the new browserContext.tracing API:
const browser = await chromium.launch();
const context = await browser.newContext();

// Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.
await context.tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true });

const page = await context.newPage();
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');

// Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.
await context.tracing.stop({ path: 'trace.zip' });
Traces are examined later with the Playwright CLI:
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
That will open the following GUI:

Canary releases
Introduction
Playwright for Node.js has a canary releases system.
It permits you to test new unreleased features instead of waiting for a full release. They get released daily on the next NPM tag of Playwright.
It is a good way to give feedback to maintainers, ensuring the newly implemented feature works as intended.
NOTE
Using a canary release in production might seem risky, but in practice, it's not.
A canary release passes all automated tests and is used to test e.g. the HTML report, Trace Viewer, or Playwright Inspector with end-to-end tests.
Next npm Dist Tag
For any code-related commit on main, the continuous integration will publish a daily canary release under the @next npm dist tag.
You can see on npm the current dist tags:
latest: stable releases
next: next releases, published daily
beta: after a release-branch was cut, usually a week before a stable release each commit gets published under this tag
Using a Canary Release
npm install -D @playwright/test@next
Documentation
The stable and the next documentation is published on playwright.dev. To see the next documentation, press Shift on the keyboard 5 times.

Test configuration
Introduction
Playwright has many options to configure how your tests are run. You can specify these options in the configuration file. Note that test runner options are top-level, do not put them into the use section.
Basic Configuration
Here are some of the most common configuration options.
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // Look for test files in the "tests" directory, relative to this configuration file.
 testDir: 'tests',

 // Run all tests in parallel.
 fullyParallel: true,

 // Fail the build on CI if you accidentally left test.only in the source code.
 forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,

 // Retry on CI only.
 retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,

 // Opt out of parallel tests on CI.
 workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,

 // Reporter to use
 reporter: 'html',

 use: {
   // Base URL to use in actions like `await page.goto('/')`.
   baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',

   // Collect trace when retrying the failed test.
   trace: 'on-first-retry',
 },
 // Configure projects for major browsers.
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
   },
 ],
 // Run your local dev server before starting the tests.
 webServer: {
   command: 'npm run start',
   url: 'http://localhost:3000',
   reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
 },
});
Option
Description
testConfig.forbidOnly
Whether to exit with an error if any tests are marked as test.only. Useful on CI.
testConfig.fullyParallel
have all tests in all files to run in parallel. See Parallelism and Sharding for more details.
testConfig.projects
Run tests in multiple configurations or on multiple browsers
testConfig.reporter
Reporter to use. See Test Reporters to learn more about which reporters are available.
testConfig.retries
The maximum number of retry attempts per test. See Test Retries to learn more about retries.
testConfig.testDir
Directory with the test files.
testConfig.use
Options with use{}
testConfig.webServer
To launch a server during the tests, use the webServer option
testConfig.workers
The maximum number of concurrent worker processes to use for parallelizing tests. Can also be set as percentage of logical CPU cores, e.g. '50%'.. See Parallelism and Sharding for more details.

Filtering Tests
Filter tests by glob patterns or regular expressions.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // Glob patterns or regular expressions to ignore test files.
 testIgnore: '*test-assets',

 // Glob patterns or regular expressions that match test files.
 testMatch: '*todo-tests/*.spec.ts',
});
Option
Description
testConfig.testIgnore
Glob patterns or regular expressions that should be ignored when looking for the test files. For example, '*test-assets'
testConfig.testMatch
Glob patterns or regular expressions that match test files. For example, '*todo-tests/*.spec.ts'. By default, Playwright runs .*(test|spec).(js|ts|mjs) files.

Advanced Configuration
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // Folder for test artifacts such as screenshots, videos, traces, etc.
 outputDir: 'test-results',

 // path to the global setup files.
 globalSetup: require.resolve('./global-setup'),

 // path to the global teardown files.
 globalTeardown: require.resolve('./global-teardown'),

 // Each test is given 30 seconds.
 timeout: 30000,

});
Option
Description
testConfig.globalSetup
Path to the global setup file. This file will be required and run before all the tests. It must export a single function.
testConfig.globalTeardown
Path to the global teardown file. This file will be required and run after all the tests. It must export a single function.
testConfig.outputDir
Folder for test artifacts such as screenshots, videos, traces, etc.
testConfig.timeout
Playwright enforces a timeout for each test, 30 seconds by default. Time spent by the test function, test fixtures and beforeEach hooks is included in the test timeout.

Expect Options
Configuration for the expect assertion library.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 expect: {
   // Maximum time expect() should wait for the condition to be met.
   timeout: 5000,

   toHaveScreenshot: {
     // An acceptable amount of pixels that could be different, unset by default.
     maxDiffPixels: 10,
   },

   toMatchSnapshot: {
     // An acceptable ratio of pixels that are different to the
     // total amount of pixels, between 0 and 1.
     maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.1,
   },
 },

});
Option
Description
testConfig.expect
Web first assertions like expect(locator).toHaveText() have a separate timeout of 5 seconds by default. This is the maximum time the expect() should wait for the condition to be met. Learn more about test and expect timeouts and how to set them for a single test.
expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()
Configuration for the expect(locator).toHaveScreenshot() method.
expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()
Configuration for the expect(locator).toMatchSnapshot() method.

Test use options
Introduction
In addition to configuring the test runner you can also configure Emulation, Network and Recording for the Browser or BrowserContext. These options are passed to the use: {} object in the Playwright config.
Basic Options
Set the base URL and storage state for all tests:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   // Base URL to use in actions like `await page.goto('/')`.
   baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',

   // Populates context with given storage state.
   storageState: 'state.json',
 },
});
Option
Description
testOptions.baseURL
Base URL used for all pages in the context. Allows navigating by using just the path, for example page.goto('/settings').
testOptions.storageState
Populates context with given storage state. Useful for easy authentication, learn more.

Emulation Options
With Playwright you can emulate a real device such as a mobile phone or tablet. See our guide on projects for more info on emulating devices. You can also emulate the "geolocation", "locale" and "timezone" for all tests or for a specific test as well as set the "permissions" to show notifications or change the "colorScheme". See our Emulation guide to learn more.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   // Emulates `'prefers-colors-scheme'` media feature.
   colorScheme: 'dark',

   // Context geolocation.
   geolocation: { longitude: 12.492507, latitude: 41.889938 },

   // Emulates the user locale.
   locale: 'en-GB',

   // Grants specified permissions to the browser context.
   permissions: ['geolocation'],

   // Emulates the user timezone.
   timezoneId: 'Europe/Paris',

   // Viewport used for all pages in the context.
   viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
 },
});
Option
Description
testOptions.colorScheme
Emulates 'prefers-colors-scheme' media feature, supported values are 'light' and 'dark'
testOptions.geolocation

A list of permissions to grant to all pages in the context.
testOptions.timezoneId
Changes the timezone of the context.
testOptions.viewport
Viewport used for all pages in the context.

Network Options
Available options to configure networking:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   // Whether to automatically download all the attachments.
   acceptDownloads: false,

   // An object containing additional HTTP headers to be sent with every request.
   extraHTTPHeaders: {
     'X-My-Header': 'value',
   },

   // Credentials for HTTP authentication.
   httpCredentials: {
     username: 'user',
     password: 'pass',
   },

   // Whether to ignore HTTPS errors during navigation.
   ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,

   // Whether to emulate network being offline.
   offline: true,

   // Proxy settings used for all pages in the test.
   proxy: {
     server: 'http://myproxy.com:3128',
     bypass: 'localhost',
   },
 },
});
Option
Description
testOptions.acceptDownloads
Whether to automatically download all the attachments, defaults to true. Learn more about working with downloads.

testOptions.ignoreHTTPSErrors
Whether to ignore HTTPS errors during navigation.
testOptions.offline
Whether to emulate network being offline.
testOptions.proxy
Proxy settings used for all pages in the test.

NOTE
You don't have to configure anything to mock network requests. Just define a custom Route that mocks the network for a browser context. See our network mocking guide to learn more.
Recording Options
With Playwright you can capture screenshots, record videos as well as traces of your test. By default these are turned off but you can enable them by setting the screenshot, video and trace options in your playwright.config.js file.
Trace files, screenshots and videos will appear in the test output directory, typically test-results.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   // Capture screenshot after each test failure.
   screenshot: 'only-on-failure',

   // Record trace only when retrying a test for the first time.
   trace: 'on-first-retry',

   // Record video only when retrying a test for the first time.
   video: 'on-first-retry'
 },
});
Option
Description
testOptions.screenshot
Capture screenshots of your test. Options include 'off', 'on' and 'only-on-failure'
testOptions.trace
Playwright can produce test traces while running the tests. Later on, you can view the trace and get detailed information about Playwright execution by opening Trace Viewer. Options include: 'off', 'on', 'retain-on-failure' and 'on-first-retry'
testOptions.video
Playwright can record videos for your tests. Options include: 'off', 'on', 'retain-on-failure' and 'on-first-retry'

Other Options
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   // Maximum time each action such as `click()` can take. Defaults to 0 (no limit).
   actionTimeout: 0,

   // Name of the browser that runs tests. For example `chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`.
   browserName: 'chromium',

   // Toggles bypassing Content-Security-Policy.
   bypassCSP: true,

   // Channel to use, for example "chrome", "chrome-beta", "msedge", "msedge-beta".
   channel: 'chrome',

   // Run browser in headless mode.
   headless: false,

   // Change the default data-testid attribute.
   testIdAttribute: 'pw-test-id',
 },
});
Option
Description
testOptions.actionTimeout
Timeout for each Playwright action in milliseconds. Defaults to 0 (no timeout). Learn more about timeouts and how to set them for a single test.
testOptions.browserName
Name of the browser that runs tests. Defaults to 'chromium'. Options include chromium, firefox, or webkit.
testOptions.bypassCSP
Toggles bypassing Content-Security-Policy. Useful when CSP includes the production origin. Defaults to false.
testOptions.channel
Browser channel to use. Learn more about different browsers and channels.
testOptions.headless
Whether to run the browser in headless mode meaning no browser is shown when running tests. Defaults to true.
testOptions.testIdAttribute
Changes the default data-testid attribute used by Playwright locators.

More browser and context options
Any options accepted by browserType.launch(), browser.newContext() or browserType.connect() can be put into launchOptions, contextOptions or connectOptions respectively in the use section.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   launchOptions: {
     slowMo: 50,
   },
 },
});
However, most common ones like headless or viewport are available directly in the use section - see basic options, emulation or network.
Explicit Context Creation and Option Inheritance
If using the built-in browser fixture, calling browser.newContext() will create a context with options inherited from the config:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   userAgent: 'some custom ua',
   viewport: { width: 100, height: 100 },
 },
});
An example test illustrating the initial context options are set:
test('should inherit use options on context when using built-in browser fixture', async ({
 browser,
}) => {
 const context = await browser.newContext();
 const page = await context.newPage();
 expect(await page.evaluate(() => navigator.userAgent)).toBe('some custom ua');
 expect(await page.evaluate(() => window.innerWidth)).toBe(100);
 await context.close();
});
Configuration Scopes
You can configure Playwright globally, per project, or per test. For example, you can set the locale to be used globally by adding locale to the use option of the Playwright config, and then override it for a specific project using the project option in the config. You can also override it for a specific test by adding test.use({}) in the test file and passing in the options.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   locale: 'en-GB'
 },
});
You can override options for a specific project using the project option in the Playwright config.
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: {
       ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
       locale: 'de-DE',
     },
   },
 ],
});
You can override options for a specific test file by using the test.use() method and passing in the options. For example to run tests with the French locale for a specific test:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({ locale: 'fr-FR' });

test('example', async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});
The same works inside a describe block. For example to run tests in a describe block with the French locale:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('french language block', () => {

 test.use({ locale: 'fr-FR' });

 test('example', async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });
});
Reset an option
You can reset an option to the value defined in the config file. Consider the following config that sets a baseURL:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   baseURL: 'https://playwright.dev',
 },
});
You can now configure baseURL for a file, and also opt-out for a single test.
intro.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

// Configure baseURL for this file.
test.use({ baseURL: 'https://playwright.dev/docs/intro' });

test('check intro contents', async ({ page }) => {
 // This test will use "https://playwright.dev/docs/intro" base url as defined above.
});

test.describe(() => {
 // Reset the value to a config-defined one.
 test.use({ baseURL: undefined });

 test('can navigate to intro from the home page', async ({ page }) => {
   // This test will use "https://playwright.dev" base url as defined in the config.
 });
});
If you would like to completely reset the value to undefined, use a long-form fixture notation.
intro.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

// Completely unset baseURL for this file.
test.use({
 baseURL: [async ({}, use) => use(undefined), { scope: 'test' }],
});

test('no base url', async ({ page }) => {
 // This test will not have a base url.
});

Annotations
Introduction
Playwright supports tags and annotations that are displayed in the test report.
You can add your own tags and annotations at any moment, but Playwright comes with a few built-in ones:
test.skip() marks the test as irrelevant. Playwright does not run such a test. Use this annotation when the test is not applicable in some configuration.
test.fail() marks the test as failing. Playwright will run this test and ensure it does indeed fail. If the test does not fail, Playwright will complain.
test.fixme() marks the test as failing. Playwright will not run this test, as opposed to the fail annotation. Use fixme when running the test is slow or crashes.
test.slow() marks the test as slow and triples the test timeout.
Annotations can be added to a single test or a group of tests.
Built-in annotations can be conditional, in which case they apply when the condition is truthy, and may depend on test fixtures. There could be multiple annotations on the same test, possibly in different configurations.
Focus a test
You can focus some tests. When there are focused tests, only these tests run.
test.only('focus this test', async ({ page }) => {
 // Run only focused tests in the entire project.
});
Skip a test
Mark a test as skipped.
test.skip('skip this test', async ({ page }) => {
 // This test is not run
});
Conditionally skip a test
You can skip certain test based on the condition.
test('skip this test', async ({ page, browserName }) => {
 test.skip(browserName === 'firefox', 'Still working on it');
});
Group tests
You can group tests to give them a logical name or to scope before/after hooks to the group.
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('two tests', () => {
 test('one', async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });

 test('two', async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });
});
Tag tests
Sometimes you want to tag your tests as @fast or @slow, and then filter by tag in the test report. Or you might want to only run tests that have a certain tag.
To tag a test, either provide an additional details object when declaring a test, or add @-token to the test title. Note that tags must start with @ symbol.
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('test login page', {
 tag: '@fast',
}, async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});

test('test full report @slow', async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});
You can also tag all tests in a group or provide multiple tags:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('group', {
 tag: '@report',
}, () => {
 test('test report header', async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });

 test('test full report', {
   tag: ['@slow', '@vrt'],
 }, async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });
});
You can now run tests that have a particular tag with --grep command line option.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
npx playwright test --grep @fast
Or if you want the opposite, you can skip the tests with a certain tag:
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
npx playwright test --grep-invert @fast
To run tests containing either tag (logical OR operator):
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
npx playwright test --grep "@fast|@slow"
Or run tests containing both tags (logical AND operator) using regex lookaheads:
npx playwright test --grep "(?=.*@fast)(?=.*@slow)"
You can also filter tests in the configuration file via testConfig.grep and testProject.grep.
Annotate tests
If you would like to annotate your tests with something more substantial than a tag, you can do that when declaring a test. Annotations have a type and a description for more context and available in reporter API. Playwright's built-in HTML reporter shows all annotations, except those where type starts with _ symbol.
For example, to annotate a test with an issue url:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('test login page', {
 annotation: {
   type: 'issue',
   description: 'https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/23180',
 },
}, async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});
You can also annotate all tests in a group or provide multiple annotations:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('report tests', {
 annotation: { type: 'category', description: 'report' },
}, () => {
 test('test report header', async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });

 test('test full report', {
   annotation: [
     { type: 'issue', description: 'https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/23180' },
     { type: 'performance', description: 'very slow test!' },
   ],
 }, async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });
});
Conditionally skip a group of tests
For example, you can run a group of tests just in Chromium by passing a callback.
example.spec.ts

test.describe('chromium only', () => {
 test.skip(({ browserName }) => browserName !== 'chromium', 'Chromium only!');

 test.beforeAll(async () => {
   // This hook is only run in Chromium.
 });

 test('test 1', async ({ page }) => {
   // This test is only run in Chromium.
 });

 test('test 2', async ({ page }) => {
   // This test is only run in Chromium.
 });
});
Use fixme in beforeEach hook
To avoid running beforeEach hooks, you can put annotations in the hook itself.
example.spec.ts

test.beforeEach(async ({ page, isMobile }) => {
 test.fixme(isMobile, 'Settings page does not work in mobile yet');

 await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/settings');
});

test('user profile', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.getByText('My Profile').click();
 // ...
});
Runtime annotations
While the test is already running, you can add annotations to test.info().annotations.
example.spec.ts

test('example test', async ({ page, browser }) => {
 test.info().annotations.push({
   type: 'browser version',
   description: browser.version(),
 });

 // ...
});

Emulation
Introduction
With Playwright you can test your app on any browser as well as emulate a real device such as a mobile phone or tablet. Simply configure the devices you would like to emulate and Playwright will simulate the browser behavior such as "userAgent", "screenSize", "viewport" and if it "hasTouch" enabled. You can also emulate the "geolocation", "locale" and "timezone" for all tests or for a specific test as well as set the "permissions" to show notifications or change the "colorScheme".
Devices
Playwright comes with a registry of device parameters using playwright.devices for selected desktop, tablet and mobile devices. It can be used to simulate browser behavior for a specific device such as user agent, screen size, viewport and if it has touch enabled. All tests will run with the specified device parameters.
Test
Library
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test'; // import devices

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: {
       ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
     },
   },
   {
     name: 'Mobile Safari',
     use: {
       ...devices['iPhone 13'],
     },
   },
 ],
});

Viewport
The viewport is included in the device but you can override it for some tests with page.setViewportSize().
Test
Library
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: {
       ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
       // It is important to define the `viewport` property after destructuring `devices`,
       // since devices also define the `viewport` for that device.
       viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
     },
   },
 ]
});
Test file:
Test
Library
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({
 viewport: { width: 1600, height: 1200 },
});

test('my test', async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});
The same works inside a test file.
Test
Library
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('specific viewport block', () => {
 test.use({ viewport: { width: 1600, height: 1200 } });

 test('my test', async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });
});
isMobile
Whether the meta viewport tag is taken into account and touch events are enabled.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: {
       ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
       // It is important to define the `isMobile` property after destructuring `devices`,
       // since devices also define the `isMobile` for that device.
       isMobile: false,
     },
   },
 ]
});
Locale & Timezone
Emulate the browser Locale and Timezone which can be set globally for all tests in the config and then overridden for particular tests.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   // Emulates the browser locale.
   locale: 'en-GB',

   // Emulates the browser timezone.
   timezoneId: 'Europe/Paris',
 },
});
Test
Library
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({
 locale: 'de-DE',
 timezoneId: 'Europe/Berlin',
});

test('my test for de lang in Berlin timezone', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://www.bing.com');
 // ...
});

Note that this only affects the browser timezone and locale, not the test runner timezone. To set the test runner timezone, you can use the TZ environment variable.
Permissions
Allow app to show system notifications.
Test
Library
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   // Grants specified permissions to the browser context.
   permissions: ['notifications'],
 },
});
Allow notifications for a specific domain.
Test
Library
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test.beforeEach(async ({ context }) => {
 // Runs before each test and signs in each page.
 await context.grantPermissions(['notifications'], { origin: 'https://skype.com' });
});

test('first', async ({ page }) => {
 // page has notifications permission for https://skype.com.
});
Revoke all permissions with browserContext.clearPermissions().
// Library
await context.clearPermissions();
Geolocation
Grant "geolocation" permissions and set geolocation to a specific area.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   // Context geolocation
   geolocation: { longitude: 12.492507, latitude: 41.889938 },
   permissions: ['geolocation'],
 },
});
Test
Library
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({
 geolocation: { longitude: 41.890221, latitude: 12.492348 },
 permissions: ['geolocation'],
});

test('my test with geolocation', async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});

Change the location later:
Test
Library
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({
 geolocation: { longitude: 41.890221, latitude: 12.492348 },
 permissions: ['geolocation'],
});

test('my test with geolocation', async ({ page, context }) => {
 // overwrite the location for this test
 await context.setGeolocation({ longitude: 48.858455, latitude: 2.294474 });
});
Note you can only change geolocation for all pages in the context.
Color Scheme and Media
Emulate the users "colorScheme". Supported values are 'light' and 'dark'. You can also emulate the media type with page.emulateMedia().
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   colorScheme: 'dark',
 },
});
Test
Library
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({
 colorScheme: 'dark' // or 'light'
});

test('my test with dark mode', async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});

User Agent
The User Agent is included in the device and therefore you will rarely need to change it however if you do need to test a different user agent you can override it with the userAgent property.
Test
Library
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({ userAgent: 'My user agent' });

test('my user agent test', async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});
Offline
Emulate the network being offline.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   offline: true
 },
});
JavaScript Enabled
Emulate a user scenario where JavaScript is disabled.
Test
Library
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({ javaScriptEnabled: false });

test('test with no JavaScript', async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});

Fixtures
Introduction
Playwright Test is based on the concept of test fixtures. Test fixtures are used to establish the environment for each test, giving the test everything it needs and nothing else. Test fixtures are isolated between tests. With fixtures, you can group tests based on their meaning, instead of their common setup.
Built-in fixtures
You have already used test fixtures in your first test.
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

 await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});
The { page } argument tells Playwright Test to set up the page fixture and provide it to your test function.
Here is a list of the pre-defined fixtures that you are likely to use most of the time:
Fixture
Type
Description
page
Page
Isolated page for this test run.
context
BrowserContext
Isolated context for this test run. The page fixture belongs to this context as well. Learn how to configure context.
browser
Browser
Browsers are shared across tests to optimize resources. Learn how to configure browsers.
browserName
string
The name of the browser currently running the test. Either chromium, firefox or webkit.
request
APIRequestContext
Isolated APIRequestContext instance for this test run.

Without fixtures
Here is how a typical test environment setup differs between the traditional test style and the fixture-based one.
TodoPage is a class that helps us interact with a "todo list" page of the web app, following the Page Object Model pattern. It uses Playwright's page internally.
Click to expand the code for the TodoPage
todo.spec.ts
const { test } = require('@playwright/test');
const { TodoPage } = require('./todo-page');

test.describe('todo tests', () => {
 let todoPage;

 test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
   todoPage = new TodoPage(page);
   await todoPage.goto();
   await todoPage.addToDo('item1');
   await todoPage.addToDo('item2');
 });

 test.afterEach(async () => {
   await todoPage.removeAll();
 });

 test('should add an item', async () => {
   await todoPage.addToDo('my item');
   // ...
 });

 test('should remove an item', async () => {
   await todoPage.remove('item1');
   // ...
 });
});
With fixtures
Fixtures have a number of advantages over before/after hooks:
Fixtures encapsulate setup and teardown in the same place so it is easier to write. So if you have an after hook that tears down what was created in a before hook, consider turning them into a fixture.
Fixtures are reusable between test files - you can define them once and use them in all your tests. That's how Playwright's built-in page fixture works. So if you have a helper function that is used in multiple tests, consider turning it into a fixture.
Fixtures are on-demand - you can define as many fixtures as you'd like, and Playwright Test will setup only the ones needed by your test and nothing else.
Fixtures are composable - they can depend on each other to provide complex behaviors.
Fixtures are flexible. Tests can use any combination of fixtures to precisely tailor the environment to their needs, without affecting other tests.
Fixtures simplify grouping. You no longer need to wrap tests in describes that set up their environment, and are free to group your tests by their meaning instead.
Click to expand the code for the TodoPage
example.spec.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import { TodoPage } from './todo-page';

// Extend basic test by providing a "todoPage" fixture.
const test = base.extend<{ todoPage: TodoPage }>({
 todoPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
   const todoPage = new TodoPage(page);
   await todoPage.goto();
   await todoPage.addToDo('item1');
   await todoPage.addToDo('item2');
   await use(todoPage);
   await todoPage.removeAll();
 },
});

test('should add an item', async ({ todoPage }) => {
 await todoPage.addToDo('my item');
 // ...
});

test('should remove an item', async ({ todoPage }) => {
 await todoPage.remove('item1');
 // ...
});
Creating a fixture
To create your own fixture, use test.extend() to create a new test object that will include it.
Below we create two fixtures todoPage and settingsPage that follow the Page Object Model pattern.
Click to expand the code for the TodoPage and SettingsPage
my-test.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import { TodoPage } from './todo-page';
import { SettingsPage } from './settings-page';

// Declare the types of your fixtures.
type MyFixtures = {
 todoPage: TodoPage;
 settingsPage: SettingsPage;
};

// Extend base test by providing "todoPage" and "settingsPage".
// This new "test" can be used in multiple test files, and each of them will get the fixtures.
export const test = base.extend<MyFixtures>({
 todoPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
   // Set up the fixture.
   const todoPage = new TodoPage(page);
   await todoPage.goto();
   await todoPage.addToDo('item1');
   await todoPage.addToDo('item2');

   // Use the fixture value in the test.
   await use(todoPage);

   // Clean up the fixture.
   await todoPage.removeAll();
 },

 settingsPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
   await use(new SettingsPage(page));
 },
});
export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
NOTE
Custom fixture names should start with a letter or underscore, and can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.
Using a fixture
Just mention a fixture in your test function argument, and the test runner will take care of it. Fixtures are also available in hooks and other fixtures. If you use TypeScript, fixtures will be type safe.
Below we use the todoPage and settingsPage fixtures that we defined above.
import { test, expect } from './my-test';

test.beforeEach(async ({ settingsPage }) => {
 await settingsPage.switchToDarkMode();
});

test('basic test', async ({ todoPage, page }) => {
 await todoPage.addToDo('something nice');
 await expect(page.getByTestId('todo-title')).toContainText(['something nice']);
});
Overriding fixtures
In addition to creating your own fixtures, you can also override existing fixtures to fit your needs. Consider the following example which overrides the page fixture by automatically navigating to the baseURL:
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

export const test = base.extend({
 page: async ({ baseURL, page }, use) => {
   await page.goto(baseURL);
   await use(page);
 },
});
Notice that in this example, the page fixture is able to depend on other built-in fixtures such as testOptions.baseURL. We can now configure baseURL in the configuration file, or locally in the test file with test.use().
example.spec.ts

test.use({ baseURL: 'https://playwright.dev' });
Fixtures can also be overridden, causing the base fixture to be completely replaced with something different. For example, we could override the testOptions.storageState fixture to provide our own data.
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

export const test = base.extend({
 storageState: async ({}, use) => {
   const cookie = await getAuthCookie();
   await use({ cookies: [cookie] });
 },
});
Worker-scoped fixtures
Playwright Test uses worker processes to run test files. Similar to how test fixtures are set up for individual test runs, worker fixtures are set up for each worker process. That's where you can set up services, run servers, etc. Playwright Test will reuse the worker process for as many test files as it can, provided their worker fixtures match and hence environments are identical.
Below we'll create an account fixture that will be shared by all tests in the same worker, and override the page fixture to log in to this account for each test. To generate unique accounts, we'll use the workerInfo.workerIndex that is available to any test or fixture. Note the tuple-like syntax for the worker fixture - we have to pass {scope: 'worker'} so that test runner sets this fixture up once per worker.
my-test.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

type Account = {
 username: string;
 password: string;
};

// Note that we pass worker fixture types as a second template parameter.
export const test = base.extend<{}, { account: Account }>({
 account: [async ({ browser }, use, workerInfo) => {
   // Unique username.
   const username = 'user' + workerInfo.workerIndex;
   const password = 'verysecure';

   // Create the account with Playwright.
   const page = await browser.newPage();
   await page.goto('/signup');
   await page.getByLabel('User Name').fill(username);
   await page.getByLabel('Password').fill(password);
   await page.getByText('Sign up').click();
   // Make sure everything is ok.
   await expect(page.getByTestId('result')).toHaveText('Success');
   // Do not forget to cleanup.
   await page.close();

   // Use the account value.
   await use({ username, password });
 }, { scope: 'worker' }],

 page: async ({ page, account }, use) => {
   // Sign in with our account.
   const { username, password } = account;
   await page.goto('/signin');
   await page.getByLabel('User Name').fill(username);
   await page.getByLabel('Password').fill(password);
   await page.getByText('Sign in').click();
   await expect(page.getByTestId('userinfo')).toHaveText(username);

   // Use signed-in page in the test.
   await use(page);
 },
});
export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
Automatic fixtures
Automatic fixtures are set up for each test/worker, even when the test does not list them directly. To create an automatic fixture, use the tuple syntax and pass { auto: true }.
Here is an example fixture that automatically attaches debug logs when the test fails, so we can later review the logs in the reporter. Note how it uses the TestInfo object that is available in each test/fixture to retrieve metadata about the test being run.
my-test.ts
import debug from 'debug';
import fs from 'fs';
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

export const test = base.extend<{ saveLogs: void }>({
 saveLogs: [async ({}, use, testInfo) => {
   // Collecting logs during the test.
   const logs = [];
   debug.log = (...args) => logs.push(args.map(String).join(''));
   debug.enable('myserver');

   await use();

   // After the test we can check whether the test passed or failed.
   if (testInfo.status !== testInfo.expectedStatus) {
     // outputPath() API guarantees a unique file name.
     const logFile = testInfo.outputPath('logs.txt');
     await fs.promises.writeFile(logFile, logs.join('\n'), 'utf8');
     testInfo.attachments.push({ name: 'logs', contentType: 'text/plain', path: logFile });
   }
 }, { auto: true }],
});
export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
Fixture timeout
By default, the fixture inherits the timeout value of the test. However, for slow fixtures, especially worker-scoped ones, it is convenient to have a separate timeout. This way you can keep the overall test timeout small, and give the slow fixture more time.
import { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/test';

const test = base.extend<{ slowFixture: string }>({
 slowFixture: [async ({}, use) => {
   // ... perform a slow operation ...
   await use('hello');
 }, { timeout: 60000 }]
});

test('example test', async ({ slowFixture }) => {
 // ...
});
Fixtures-options
Playwright Test supports running multiple test projects that can be configured separately. You can use "option" fixtures to make your configuration options declarative and type safe. Learn more about parameterizing tests.
Below we'll create a defaultItem option in addition to the todoPage fixture from other examples. This option will be set in the configuration file. Note the tuple syntax and { option: true } argument.
Click to expand the code for the TodoPage
my-test.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import { TodoPage } from './todo-page';

// Declare your options to type-check your configuration.
export type MyOptions = {
 defaultItem: string;
};
type MyFixtures = {
 todoPage: TodoPage;
};

// Specify both option and fixture types.
export const test = base.extend<MyOptions & MyFixtures>({
 // Define an option and provide a default value.
 // We can later override it in the config.
 defaultItem: ['Something nice', { option: true }],

 // Our "todoPage" fixture depends on the option.
 todoPage: async ({ page, defaultItem }, use) => {
   const todoPage = new TodoPage(page);
   await todoPage.goto();
   await todoPage.addToDo(defaultItem);
   await use(todoPage);
   await todoPage.removeAll();
 },
});
export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
We can now use the todoPage fixture as usual, and set the defaultItem option in the configuration file.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import type { MyOptions } from './my-test';

export default defineConfig<MyOptions>({
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'shopping',
     use: { defaultItem: 'Buy milk' },
   },
   {
     name: 'wellbeing',
     use: { defaultItem: 'Exercise!' },
   },
 ]
});
Array as an option value
If the value of your option is an array, for example [{ name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' }], you'll need to wrap it into an extra array when providing the value. This is best illustrated with an example.
type Person = { name: string };
const test = base.extend<{ persons: Person[] }>({
 // Declare the option, default value is an empty array.
 persons: [[], { option: true }],
});

// Option value is an array of persons.
const actualPersons = [{ name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' }];
test.use({
 // CORRECT: Wrap the value into an array and pass the scope.
 persons: [actualPersons, { scope: 'test' }],
});

test.use({
 // WRONG: passing an array value directly will not work.
 persons: actualPersons,
});
Reset an option
You can reset an option to the value defined in the config file by setting it to undefined. Consider the following config that sets a baseURL:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   baseURL: 'https://playwright.dev',
 },
});
You can now configure baseURL for a file, and also opt-out for a single test.
intro.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

// Configure baseURL for this file.
test.use({ baseURL: 'https://playwright.dev/docs/intro' });

test('check intro contents', async ({ page }) => {
 // This test will use "https://playwright.dev/docs/intro" base url as defined above.
});

test.describe(() => {
 // Reset the value to a config-defined one.
 test.use({ baseURL: undefined });

 test('can navigate to intro from the home page', async ({ page }) => {
   // This test will use "https://playwright.dev" base url as defined in the config.
 });
});
If you would like to completely reset the value to undefined, use a long-form fixture notation.
intro.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

// Completely unset baseURL for this file.
test.use({
 baseURL: [async ({}, use) => use(undefined), { scope: 'test' }],
});

test('no base url', async ({ page }) => {
 // This test will not have a base url.
});
Execution order
Each fixture has a setup and teardown phase before and after the await use() call in the fixture. Setup is executed before the test/hook requiring it is run, and teardown is executed when the fixture is no longer being used by the test/hook.
Fixtures follow these rules to determine the execution order:
When fixture A depends on fixture B: B is always set up before A and torn down after A.
Non-automatic fixtures are executed lazily, only when the test/hook needs them.
Test-scoped fixtures are torn down after each test, while worker-scoped fixtures are only torn down when the worker process executing tests is torn down.
Consider the following example:
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

const test = base.extend<{
 testFixture: string,
 autoTestFixture: string,
 unusedFixture: string,
}, {
 workerFixture: string,
 autoWorkerFixture: string,
}>({
 workerFixture: [async ({ browser }) => {
   // workerFixture setup...
   await use('workerFixture');
   // workerFixture teardown...
 }, { scope: 'worker' }],

 autoWorkerFixture: [async ({ browser }) => {
   // autoWorkerFixture setup...
   await use('autoWorkerFixture');
   // autoWorkerFixture teardown...
 }, { scope: 'worker', auto: true }],

 testFixture: [async ({ page, workerFixture }) => {
   // testFixture setup...
   await use('testFixture');
   // testFixture teardown...
 }, { scope: 'test' }],

 autoTestFixture: [async () => {
   // autoTestFixture setup...
   await use('autoTestFixture');
   // autoTestFixture teardown...
 }, { scope: 'test', auto: true }],

 unusedFixture: [async ({ page }) => {
   // unusedFixture setup...
   await use('unusedFixture');
   // unusedFixture teardown...
 }, { scope: 'test' }],
});

test.beforeAll(async () => { /* ... */ });
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
test('first test', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
test('second test', async ({ testFixture }) => { /* ... */ });
test.afterEach(async () => { /* ... */ });
test.afterAll(async () => { /* ... */ });
Normally, if all tests pass and no errors are thrown, the order of execution is as following.
worker setup and beforeAll section:
browser setup because it is required by autoWorkerFixture.
autoWorkerFixture setup because automatic worker fixtures are always set up before anything else.
beforeAll runs.
first test section:
autoTestFixture setup because automatic test fixtures are always set up before test and beforeEach hooks.
page setup because it is required in beforeEach hook.
beforeEach runs.
first test runs.
afterEach runs.
page teardown because it is a test-scoped fixture and should be torn down after the test finishes.
autoTestFixture teardown because it is a test-scoped fixture and should be torn down after the test finishes.
second test section:
autoTestFixture setup because automatic test fixtures are always set up before test and beforeEach hooks.
page setup because it is required in beforeEach hook.
beforeEach runs.
workerFixture setup because it is required by testFixture that is required by the second test.
testFixture setup because it is required by the second test.
second test runs.
afterEach runs.
testFixture teardown because it is a test-scoped fixture and should be torn down after the test finishes.
page teardown because it is a test-scoped fixture and should be torn down after the test finishes.
autoTestFixture teardown because it is a test-scoped fixture and should be torn down after the test finishes.
afterAll and worker teardown section:
afterAll runs.
workerFixture teardown because it is a workers-scoped fixture and should be torn down once at the end.
autoWorkerFixture teardown because it is a workers-scoped fixture and should be torn down once at the end.
browser teardown because it is a workers-scoped fixture and should be torn down once at the end.
A few observations:
page and autoTestFixture are set up and torn down for each test, as test-scoped fixtures.
unusedFixture is never set up because it is not used by any tests/hooks.
testFixture depends on workerFixture and triggers its setup.
workerFixture is lazily set up before the second test, but torn down once during worker shutdown, as a worker-scoped fixture.
autoWorkerFixture is set up for beforeAll hook, but autoTestFixture is not.
Combine custom fixtures from multiple modules
You can merge test fixtures from multiple files or modules:
fixtures.ts
import { mergeTests } from '@playwright/test';
import { test as dbTest } from 'database-test-utils';
import { test as a11yTest } from 'a11y-test-utils';

export const test = mergeTests(dbTest, a11yTest);
test.spec.ts
import { test } from './fixtures';

test('passes', async ({ database, page, a11y }) => {
 // use database and a11y fixtures.
});
Box fixtures
Usually, custom fixtures are reported as separate steps in the UI mode, Trace Viewer and various test reports. They also appear in error messages from the test runner. For frequently used fixtures, this can mean lots of noise. You can stop the fixtures steps from being shown in the UI by "boxing" it.
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

export const test = base.extend({
 helperFixture: [async ({}, use, testInfo) => {
   // ...
 }, { box: true }],
});
This is useful for non-interesting helper fixtures. For example, an automatic fixture that sets up some common data can be safely hidden from a test report.
Custom fixture title
Instead of the usual fixture name, you can give fixtures a custom title that will be shown in test reports and error messages.
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

export const test = base.extend({
 innerFixture: [async ({}, use, testInfo) => {
   // ...
 }, { title: 'my fixture' }],
});
Adding global beforeEach/afterEach hooks
test.beforeEach() and test.afterEach() hooks run before/after each test declared in the same file and same test.describe() block (if any). If you want to declare hooks that run before/after each test globally, you can declare them as auto fixtures like this:
fixtures.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

export const test = base.extend<{ forEachTest: void }>({
 forEachTest: [async ({ page }, use) => {
   // This code runs before every test.
   await page.goto('http://localhost:8000');
   await use();
   // This code runs after every test.
   console.log('Last URL:', page.url());
 }, { auto: true }],  // automatically starts for every test.
});
And then import the fixtures in all your tests:
mytest.spec.ts
import { test } from './fixtures';
import { expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic', async ({ page }) => {
 expect(page).toHaveURL('http://localhost:8000');
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
});
Adding global beforeAll/afterAll hooks
test.beforeAll() and test.afterAll() hooks run before/after all tests declared in the same file and same test.describe() block (if any), once per worker process. If you want to declare hooks that run before/after all tests in every file, you can declare them as auto fixtures with scope: 'worker' as follows:
fixtures.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

export const test = base.extend<{}, { forEachWorker: void }>({
 forEachWorker: [async ({}, use) => {
   // This code runs before all the tests in the worker process.
   console.log(`Starting test worker ${test.info().workerIndex}`);
   await use();
   // This code runs after all the tests in the worker process.
   console.log(`Stopping test worker ${test.info().workerIndex}`);
 }, { scope: 'worker', auto: true }],  // automatically starts for every worker.
});
And then import the fixtures in all your tests:
mytest.spec.ts
import { test } from './fixtures';
import { expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic', async ({ }) => {
 // ...
});
Note that the fixtures will still run once per worker process, but you don't need to redeclare them in every file.

Global setup and teardown
Introduction
There are two ways to configure global setup and teardown: using a global setup file and setting it in the config under globalSetup or using project dependencies. With project dependencies, you define a project that runs before all other projects. This is the recommended approach, as it integrates better with the Playwright test runner: your HTML report will include the global setup, traces will be recorded, and fixtures can be used. For a detailed comparison of the two approaches, see the table below.

Option 1: Project Dependencies
Project dependencies are a list of projects that need to run before the tests in another project run. They can be useful for configuring the global setup actions so that one project depends on this running first. Using dependencies allows global setup to produce traces and other artifacts.
Setup
First we add a new project with the name 'setup db'. We then give it a testProject.testMatch property in order to match the file called global.setup.ts:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 testDir: './tests',
 // ...
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'setup db',
     testMatch: /global\.setup\.ts/,
   },
   // {
   //   other project
   // }
 ]
});
Then we add the testProject.dependencies property to our projects that depend on the setup project and pass into the array the name of our dependency project, which we defined in the previous step:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 testDir: './tests',
 // ...
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'setup db',
     testMatch: /global\.setup\.ts/,
   },
   {
     name: 'chromium with db',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
     dependencies: ['setup db'],
   },
 ]
});
In this example the 'chromium with db' project depends on the 'setup db' project. We then create a setup test, stored at root level of your project (note that setup and teardown code must be defined as regular tests by calling test() function):
tests/global.setup.ts
import { test as setup } from '@playwright/test';

setup('create new database', async ({ }) => {
 console.log('creating new database...');
 // Initialize the database
});
tests/menu.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('menu', async ({ page }) => {
 // Your test that depends on the database
});
Teardown
You can teardown your setup by adding a testProject.teardown property to your setup project. This will run after all dependent projects have run.
First we add the testProject.teardown property to our setup project with the name 'cleanup db' which is the name we gave to our teardown project in the previous step:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 testDir: './tests',
 // ...
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'setup db',
     testMatch: /global\.setup\.ts/,
     teardown: 'cleanup db',
   },
   {
     name: 'cleanup db',
     testMatch: /global\.teardown\.ts/,
   },
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
     dependencies: ['setup db'],
   },
 ]
});
Then we create a global.teardown.ts file in the tests directory of your project. This will be used to delete the data from the database after all tests have run.
tests/global.teardown.ts
import { test as teardown } from '@playwright/test';

teardown('delete database', async ({ }) => {
 console.log('deleting test database...');
 // Delete the database
});
Test filtering
All test filtering options, such as --grep/--grep-invert, --shard, filtering directly by location in the command line, or using test.only(), directly select the primary tests to be run. If those tests belong to a project with dependencies, all tests from those dependencies will also run.
You can pass --no-deps command line option to ignore all dependencies and teardowns. Only your directly selected projects will run.

v1.31 release video to see the demo
Option 2: Configure globalSetup and globalTeardown
You can use the globalSetup option in the configuration file to set something up once before running all tests. The global setup file must export a single function that takes a config object. This function will be run once before all the tests.
Similarly, use globalTeardown to run something once after all the tests. Alternatively, let globalSetup return a function that will be used as a global teardown. You can pass data such as port number, authentication tokens, etc. from your global setup to your tests using environment variables.
NOTE
Beware that globalSetup and globalTeardown lack some features â see the intro section for a detailed comparison. Consider using project dependencies instead to get full feature support.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 globalSetup: require.resolve('./global-setup'),
 globalTeardown: require.resolve('./global-teardown'),
});
Example
Here is a global setup example that authenticates once and reuses authentication state in tests. It uses the baseURL and storageState options from the configuration file.
global-setup.ts
import { chromium, type FullConfig } from '@playwright/test';

async function globalSetup(config: FullConfig) {
 const { baseURL, storageState } = config.projects[0].use;
 const browser = await chromium.launch();
 const page = await browser.newPage();
 await page.goto(baseURL!);
 await page.getByLabel('User Name').fill('user');
 await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('password');
 await page.getByText('Sign in').click();
 await page.context().storageState({ path: storageState as string });
 await browser.close();
}

export default globalSetup;
Specify globalSetup, baseURL and storageState in the configuration file.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 globalSetup: require.resolve('./global-setup'),
 use: {
   baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000/',
   storageState: 'state.json',
 },
});
Tests start already authenticated because we specify storageState that was populated by global setup.
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('/');
 // You are signed in!
});
You can make arbitrary data available in your tests from your global setup file by setting them as environment variables via process.env.
global-setup.ts
import type { FullConfig } from '@playwright/test';

async function globalSetup(config: FullConfig) {
 process.env.FOO = 'some data';
 // Or a more complicated data structure as JSON:
 process.env.BAR = JSON.stringify({ some: 'data' });
}

export default globalSetup;
Tests have access to the process.env properties set in the global setup.
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
 // environment variables which are set in globalSetup are only available inside test().
 const { FOO, BAR } = process.env;

 // FOO and BAR properties are populated.
 expect(FOO).toEqual('some data');

 const complexData = JSON.parse(BAR);
 expect(BAR).toEqual({ some: 'data' });
});
Capturing trace of failures during global setup
In some instances, it may be useful to capture a trace of failures encountered during the global setup. In order to do this, you must start tracing in your setup, and you must ensure that you stop tracing if an error occurs before that error is thrown. This can be achieved by wrapping your setup in a try...catch block. Here is an example that expands the global setup example to capture a trace.
global-setup.ts
import { chromium, type FullConfig } from '@playwright/test';

async function globalSetup(config: FullConfig) {
 const { baseURL, storageState } = config.projects[0].use;
 const browser = await chromium.launch();
 const context = await browser.newContext();
 const page = await context.newPage();
 try {
   await context.tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true });
   await page.goto(baseURL!);
   await page.getByLabel('User Name').fill('user');
   await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('password');
   await page.getByText('Sign in').click();
   await context.storageState({ path: storageState as string });
   await context.tracing.stop({
     path: './test-results/setup-trace.zip',
   });
   await browser.close();
 } catch (error) {
   await context.tracing.stop({
     path: './test-results/failed-setup-trace.zip',
   });
   await browser.close();
   throw error;
 }
}

export default globalSetup;

Parallelism
Introduction
Playwright Test runs tests in parallel. In order to achieve that, it runs several worker processes that run at the same time. By default, test files are run in parallel. Tests in a single file are run in order, in the same worker process.
You can configure tests using test.describe.configure to run tests in a single file in parallel.
You can configure entire project to have all tests in all files to run in parallel using testProject.fullyParallel or testConfig.fullyParallel.
To disable parallelism limit the number of workers to one.
You can control the number of parallel worker processes and limit the number of failures in the whole test suite for efficiency.
Worker processes
All tests run in worker processes. These processes are OS processes, running independently, orchestrated by the test runner. All workers have identical environments and each starts its own browser.
You can't communicate between the workers. Playwright Test reuses a single worker as much as it can to make testing faster, so multiple test files are usually run in a single worker one after another.
Workers are always shutdown after a test failure to guarantee pristine environment for following tests.
Limit workers
You can control the maximum number of parallel worker processes via command line or in the configuration file.
From the command line:
npx playwright test --workers 4
In the configuration file:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // Limit the number of workers on CI, use default locally
 workers: process.env.CI ? 2 : undefined,
});
Disable parallelism
You can disable any parallelism by allowing just a single worker at any time. Either set workers: 1 option in the configuration file or pass --workers=1 to the command line.
npx playwright test --workers=1
Parallelize tests in a single file
By default, tests in a single file are run in order. If you have many independent tests in a single file, you might want to run them in parallel with test.describe.configure().
Note that parallel tests are executed in separate worker processes and cannot share any state or global variables. Each test executes all relevant hooks just for itself, including beforeAll and afterAll.
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' });

test('runs in parallel 1', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
test('runs in parallel 2', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
Alternatively, you can opt-in all tests into this fully-parallel mode in the configuration file:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 fullyParallel: true,
});
You can also opt in for fully-parallel mode for just a few projects:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // runs all tests in all files of a specific project in parallel
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
     fullyParallel: true,
   },
 ]
});
Serial mode
You can annotate inter-dependent tests as serial. If one of the serial tests fails, all subsequent tests are skipped. All tests in a group are retried together.
NOTE
Using serial is not recommended. It is usually better to make your tests isolated, so they can be run independently.
import { test, type Page } from '@playwright/test';

// Annotate entire file as serial.
test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' });

let page: Page;

test.beforeAll(async ({ browser }) => {
 page = await browser.newPage();
});

test.afterAll(async () => {
 await page.close();
});

test('runs first', async () => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
});

test('runs second', async () => {
 await page.getByText('Get Started').click();
});
Opt out of fully parallel mode
If your configuration applies parallel mode to all tests using testConfig.fullyParallel, you might still want to run some tests with default settings. You can override the mode per describe:
test.describe('runs in parallel with other describes', () => {
 test.describe.configure({ mode: 'default' });
 test('in order 1', async ({ page }) => {});
 test('in order 2', async ({ page }) => {});
});
Shard tests between multiple machines
Playwright Test can shard a test suite, so that it can be executed on multiple machines. See sharding guide for more details.
npx playwright test --shard=2/3
Limit failures and fail fast
You can limit the number of failed tests in the whole test suite by setting maxFailures config option or passing --max-failures command line flag.
When running with "max failures" set, Playwright Test will stop after reaching this number of failed tests and skip any tests that were not executed yet. This is useful to avoid wasting resources on broken test suites.
Passing command line option:
npx playwright test --max-failures=10
Setting in the configuration file:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // Limit the number of failures on CI to save resources
 maxFailures: process.env.CI ? 10 : undefined,
});
Worker index and parallel index
Each worker process is assigned two ids: a unique worker index that starts with 1, and a parallel index that is between 0 and workers - 1. When a worker is restarted, for example after a failure, the new worker process has the same parallelIndex and a new workerIndex.
You can read an index from environment variables process.env.TEST_WORKER_INDEX and process.env.TEST_PARALLEL_INDEX, or access them through testInfo.workerIndex and testInfo.parallelIndex.
Isolate test data between parallel workers
You can leverage process.env.TEST_WORKER_INDEX or testInfo.workerIndex mentioned above to isolate user data in the database between tests running on different workers. All tests run by the worker reuse the same user.
Create playwright/fixtures.ts file that will create dbUserName fixture and initialize a new user in the test database. Use testInfo.workerIndex to differentiate between workers.
playwright/fixtures.ts
import { test as baseTest, expect } from '@playwright/test';
// Import project utils for managing users in the test database.
import { createUserInTestDatabase, deleteUserFromTestDatabase } from './my-db-utils';

export * from '@playwright/test';
export const test = baseTest.extend<{}, { dbUserName: string }>({
 // Returns db user name unique for the worker.
 dbUserName: [async ({ }, use) => {
   // Use workerIndex as a unique identifier for each worker.
   const userName = `user-${test.info().workerIndex}`;
   // Initialize user in the database.
   await createUserInTestDatabase(userName);
   await use(userName);
   // Clean up after the tests are done.
   await deleteUserFromTestDatabase(userName);
 }, { scope: 'worker' }],
});
Now, each test file should import test from our fixtures file instead of @playwright/test.
tests/example.spec.ts
// Important: import our fixtures.
import { test, expect } from '../playwright/fixtures';

test('test', async ({ dbUserName }) => {
 // Use the user name in the test.
});
Control test order
Playwright Test runs tests from a single file in the order of declaration, unless you parallelize tests in a single file.
There is no guarantee about the order of test execution across the files, because Playwright Test runs test files in parallel by default. However, if you disable parallelism, you can control test order by either naming your files in alphabetical order or using a "test list" file.
Sort test files alphabetically
When you disable parallel test execution, Playwright Test runs test files in alphabetical order. You can use some naming convention to control the test order, for example 001-user-signin-flow.spec.ts, 002-create-new-document.spec.ts and so on.
Use a "test list" file
WARNING
Tests lists are discouraged and supported as a best-effort only. Some features such as VS Code Extension and tracing may not work properly with test lists.
You can put your tests in helper functions in multiple files. Consider the following example where tests are not defined directly in the file, but rather in a wrapper function.
feature-a.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

export default function createTests() {
 test('feature-a example test', async ({ page }) => {
   // ... test goes here
 });
}

feature-b.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

export default function createTests() {
 test.use({ viewport: { width: 500, height: 500 } });

 test('feature-b example test', async ({ page }) => {
   // ... test goes here
 });
}
You can create a test list file that will control the order of tests - first run feature-b tests, then feature-a tests. Note how each test file is wrapped in a test.describe() block that calls the function where tests are defined. This way test.use() calls only affect tests from a single file.
test.list.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';
import featureBTests from './feature-b.spec.ts';
import featureATests from './feature-a.spec.ts';

test.describe(featureBTests);
test.describe(featureATests);
Now disable parallel execution by setting workers to one, and specify your test list file.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 workers: 1,
 testMatch: 'test.list.ts',
});
NOTE
Do not define your tests directly in a helper file. This could lead to unexpected results because your tests are now dependent on the order of import/require statements. Instead, wrap tests in a function that will be explicitly called by a test list file, as in the example above.

Parameterize tests
Introduction
You can either parameterize tests on a test level or on a project level.
Parameterized Tests
example.spec.ts
[
 { name: 'Alice', expected: 'Hello, Alice!' },
 { name: 'Bob', expected: 'Hello, Bob!' },
 { name: 'Charlie', expected: 'Hello, Charlie!' },
].forEach(({ name, expected }) => {
 // You can also do it with test.describe() or with multiple tests as long the test name is unique.
 test(`testing with ${name}`, async ({ page }) => {
   await page.goto(`https://example.com/greet?name=${name}`);
   await expect(page.getByRole('heading')).toHaveText(expected);
 });
});
Before and after hooks
Most of the time you should put beforeEach, beforeAll, afterEach and afterAll hooks outside of forEach, so that hooks are executed just once:
example.spec.ts
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});

test.afterEach(async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});

[
 { name: 'Alice', expected: 'Hello, Alice!' },
 { name: 'Bob', expected: 'Hello, Bob!' },
 { name: 'Charlie', expected: 'Hello, Charlie!' },
].forEach(({ name, expected }) => {
 test(`testing with ${name}`, async ({ page }) => {
   await page.goto(`https://example.com/greet?name=${name}`);
   await expect(page.getByRole('heading')).toHaveText(expected);
 });
});
If you want to have hooks for each test, you can put them inside a describe() - so they are executed for each iteration / each individual test:
example.spec.ts
[
 { name: 'Alice', expected: 'Hello, Alice!' },
 { name: 'Bob', expected: 'Hello, Bob!' },
 { name: 'Charlie', expected: 'Hello, Charlie!' },
].forEach(({ name, expected }) => {
 test.describe(() => {
   test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
     await page.goto(`https://example.com/greet?name=${name}`);
   });
   test(`testing with ${expected}`, async ({ page }) => {
     await expect(page.getByRole('heading')).toHaveText(expected);
   });
 });
});
Parameterized Projects
Playwright Test supports running multiple test projects at the same time. In the following example, we'll run two projects with different options.
We declare the option person and set the value in the config. The first project runs with the value Alice and the second with the value Bob.
TypeScript
JavaScript
my-test.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

export type TestOptions = {
 person: string;
};

export const test = base.extend<TestOptions>({
 // Define an option and provide a default value.
 // We can later override it in the config.
 person: ['John', { option: true }],
});
We can use this option in the test, similarly to fixtures.
example.spec.ts
import { test } from './my-test';

test('test 1', async ({ page, person }) => {
 await page.goto(`/index.html`);
 await expect(page.locator('#node')).toContainText(person);
 // ...
});
Now, we can run tests in multiple configurations by using projects.
TypeScript
JavaScript
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import type { TestOptions } from './my-test';

export default defineConfig<TestOptions>({
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'alice',
     use: { person: 'Alice' },
   },
   {
     name: 'bob',
     use: { person: 'Bob' },
   },
 ]
});
We can also use the option in a fixture. Learn more about fixtures.
TypeScript
JavaScript
my-test.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

export type TestOptions = {
 person: string;
};

export const test = base.extend<TestOptions>({
 // Define an option and provide a default value.
 // We can later override it in the config.
 person: ['John', { option: true }],

 // Override default "page" fixture.
 page: async ({ page, person }, use) => {
   await page.goto('/chat');
   // We use "person" parameter as a "name" for the chat room.
   await page.getByLabel('User Name').fill(person);
   await page.getByText('Enter chat room').click();
   // Each test will get a "page" that already has the person name.
   await use(page);
 },
});
NOTE
Parameterized projects behavior has changed in version 1.18. Learn more.
Passing Environment Variables
You can use environment variables to configure tests from the command line.
For example, consider the following test file that needs a username and a password. It is usually a good idea not to store your secrets in the source code, so we'll need a way to pass secrets from outside.
example.spec.ts
test(`example test`, async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
 await page.getByLabel('User Name').fill(process.env.USER_NAME);
 await page.getByLabel('Password').fill(process.env.PASSWORD);
});
You can run this test with your secret username and password set in the command line.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
USER_NAME=me PASSWORD=secret npx playwright test
Similarly, configuration file can also read environment variables passed through the command line.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   baseURL: process.env.STAGING === '1' ? 'http://staging.example.test/' : 'http://example.test/',
 }
});
Now, you can run tests against a staging or a production environment:
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
STAGING=1 npx playwright test
.env files
To make environment variables easier to manage, consider something like .env files. Here is an example that uses dotenv package to read environment variables directly in the configuration file.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import path from 'path';

// Read from ".env" file.
dotenv.config({ path: path.resolve(__dirname, '.env') });

// Alternatively, read from "../my.env" file.
dotenv.config({ path: path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'my.env') });

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   baseURL: process.env.STAGING === '1' ? 'http://staging.example.test/' : 'http://example.test/',
 }
});
Now, you can just edit .env file to set any variables you'd like.
# .env file
STAGING=0
USER_NAME=me
PASSWORD=secret
Run tests as usual, your environment variables should be picked up.
npx playwright test
Create tests via a CSV file
The Playwright test-runner runs in Node.js, this means you can directly read files from the file system and parse them with your preferred CSV library.
See for example this CSV file, in our example input.csv:
"test_case","some_value","some_other_value"
"value 1","value 11","foobar1"
"value 2","value 22","foobar21"
"value 3","value 33","foobar321"
"value 4","value 44","foobar4321"
Based on this we'll generate some tests by using the csv-parse library from NPM:
test.spec.ts
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import { test } from '@playwright/test';
import { parse } from 'csv-parse/sync';

const records = parse(fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'input.csv')), {
 columns: true,
 skip_empty_lines: true
});

for (const record of records) {
 test(`foo: ${record.test_case}`, async ({ page }) => {
   console.log(record.test_case, record.some_value, record.some_other_value);
 });
}

Projects
Introduction
A project is logical group of tests running with the same configuration. We use projects so we can run tests on different browsers and devices. Projects are configured in the playwright.config.ts file and once configured you can then run your tests on all projects or only on a specific project. You can also use projects to run the same tests in different configurations. For example, you can run the same tests in a logged-in and logged-out state.
By setting up projects you can also run a group of tests with different timeouts or retries or a group of tests against different environments such as staging and production, splitting tests per package/functionality and more.
Configure projects for multiple browsers
By using projects you can run your tests in multiple browsers such as chromium, webkit and firefox as well as branded browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Playwright can also run on emulated tablet and mobile devices. See the registry of device parameters for a complete list of selected desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
   },

   {
     name: 'firefox',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
   },

   {
     name: 'webkit',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
   },

   /* Test against mobile viewports. */
   {
     name: 'Mobile Chrome',
     use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] },
   },
   {
     name: 'Mobile Safari',
     use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] },
   },

   /* Test against branded browsers. */
   {
     name: 'Microsoft Edge',
     use: {
       ...devices['Desktop Edge'],
       channel: 'msedge'
     },
   },
   {
     name: 'Google Chrome',
     use: {
       ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
       channel: 'chrome'
     },
   },
 ],
});
Run projects
Playwright will run all projects by default.
npx playwright test

Running 7 tests using 5 workers

 â [chromium] âº example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test (2s)
 â [firefox] âº example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test (2s)
 â [webkit] âº example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test (2s)
 â [Mobile Chrome] âº example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test (2s)
 â [Mobile Safari] âº example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test (2s)
 â [Microsoft Edge] âº example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test (2s)
 â [Google Chrome] âº example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test (2s)
Use the --project command line option to run a single project.
npx playwright test --project=firefox

Running 1 test using 1 worker

 â [firefox] âº example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test (2s)
The VS Code test runner runs your tests on the default browser of Chrome. To run on other/multiple browsers click the play button's dropdown from the testing sidebar and choose another profile or modify the default profile by clicking Select Default Profile and select the browsers you wish to run your tests on.

Choose a specific profile, various profiles or all profiles to run tests on.

Configure projects for multiple environments
By setting up projects we can also run a group of tests with different timeouts or retries or run a group of tests against different environments. For example we can run our tests against a staging environment with 2 retries as well as against a production environment with 0 retries.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 timeout: 60000, // Timeout is shared between all tests.
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'staging',
     use: {
       baseURL: 'staging.example.com',
     },
     retries: 2,
   },
   {
     name: 'production',
     use: {
       baseURL: 'production.example.com',
     },
     retries: 0,
   },
 ],
});
Splitting tests into projects
We can split tests into projects and use filters to run a subset of tests. For example, we can create a project that runs tests using a filter matching all tests with a specific file name. We can then have another group of tests that ignore specific test files.
Here is an example that defines a common timeout and two projects. The "Smoke" project runs a small subset of tests without retries, and "Default" project runs all other tests with retries.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 timeout: 60000, // Timeout is shared between all tests.
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'Smoke',
     testMatch: /.*smoke.spec.ts/,
     retries: 0,
   },
   {
     name: 'Default',
     testIgnore: /.*smoke.spec.ts/,
     retries: 2,
   },
 ],
});
Dependencies
Dependencies are a list of projects that need to run before the tests in another project run. They can be useful for configuring the global setup actions so that one project depends on this running first. When using project dependencies, test reporters will show the setup tests and the trace viewer will record traces of the setup. You can use the inspector to inspect the DOM snapshot of the trace of your setup tests and you can also use fixtures inside your setup.
In this example the chromium, firefox and webkit projects depend on the setup project.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'setup',
     testMatch: '**/*.setup.ts',
   },
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
     dependencies: ['setup'],
   },
   {
     name: 'firefox',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
     dependencies: ['setup'],
   },
   {
     name: 'webkit',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
     dependencies: ['setup'],
   },
 ],
});
Running Sequence
When working with tests that have a dependency, the dependency will always run first and once all tests from this project have passed, then the other projects will run in parallel.
Running order:
Tests in the 'setup' project run. Once all tests from this project have passed, then the tests from the dependent projects will start running.
Tests in the 'chromium', 'webkit' and 'firefox' projects run together. By default, these projects will run in parallel, subject to the maximum workers limit.

If there are more than one dependency then these project dependencies will be run first and in parallel. If the tests from a dependency fails then the tests that rely on this project will not be run.
Running order:
Tests in the 'Browser Login' and 'DataBase' projects run in parallel:
'Browser Login' passes
â 'DataBase' fails!
The 'e2e tests' project is not run!

Teardown
You can also teardown your setup by adding a testProject.teardown property to your setup project. Teardown will run after all dependent projects have run. See the teardown guide for more information.

Test filtering
All test filtering options, such as --grep/--grep-invert, --shard, filtering directly by location in the command line, or using test.only(), directly select the primary tests to be run. If those tests belong to a project with dependencies, all tests from those dependencies will also run.
You can pass --no-deps command line option to ignore all dependencies and teardowns. Only your directly selected projects will run.
Custom project parameters
Projects can be also used to parametrize tests with your custom configuration - take a look at this separate guide.

Reporters
Introduction
Playwright Test comes with a few built-in reporters for different needs and ability to provide custom reporters. The easiest way to try out built-in reporters is to pass --reporter command line option.
npx playwright test --reporter=line
For more control, you can specify reporters programmatically in the configuration file.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: 'line',
});
Multiple reporters
You can use multiple reporters at the same time. For example you can use 'list' for nice terminal output and 'json' to get a comprehensive json file with the test results.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: [
   ['list'],
   ['json', {  outputFile: 'test-results.json' }]
 ],
});
Reporters on CI
You can use different reporters locally and on CI. For example, using concise 'dot' reporter avoids too much output. This is the default on CI.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // Concise 'dot' for CI, default 'list' when running locally
 reporter: process.env.CI ? 'dot' : 'list',
});
Built-in reporters
All built-in reporters show detailed information about failures, and mostly differ in verbosity for successful runs.
List reporter
List reporter is default (except on CI where the dot reporter is default). It prints a line for each test being run.
npx playwright test --reporter=list
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: 'list',
});

You can opt into the step rendering via passing the following config option:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: [['list', { printSteps: true }]],
});
List report supports the following configuration options and environment variables:
Environment Variable Name
Reporter Config Option
Description
Default
PLAYWRIGHT_LIST_PRINT_STEPS
printSteps
Whether to print each step on its own line.
false
PLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY


Whether to produce output suitable for a live terminal. Supports true, 1, false, 0, [WIDTH], and [WIDTH]x[HEIGHT]. [WIDTH] and [WIDTH]x[HEIGHT] specifies the TTY dimensions.
true when terminal is in TTY mode, false otherwise.
FORCE_COLOR


Whether to produce colored output.
true when terminal is in TTY mode, false otherwise.

Line reporter
Line reporter is more concise than the list reporter. It uses a single line to report last finished test, and prints failures when they occur. Line reporter is useful for large test suites where it shows the progress but does not spam the output by listing all the tests.
npx playwright test --reporter=line
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: 'line',
});
Here is an example output in the middle of a test run. Failures are reported inline.
npx playwright test --reporter=line

PLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY


Whether to produce output suitable for a live terminal. Supports true, 1, false, 0, [WIDTH], and [WIDTH]x[HEIGHT]. [WIDTH] and [WIDTH]x[HEIGHT] specifies the TTY dimensions.
true when terminal is in TTY mode, false otherwise.
FORCE_COLOR


Whether to produce colored output.
true when terminal is in TTY mode, false otherwise.

Dot reporter
Dot reporter is very concise - it only produces a single character per successful test run. It is the default on CI and useful where you don't want a lot of output.
npx playwright test --reporter=dot
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: 'dot',
});
Here is an example output in the middle of a test run. Failures will be listed at the end.

true when terminal is in TTY mode, false otherwise.

HTML reporter
HTML reporter produces a self-contained folder that contains report for the test run that can be served as a web page.
npx playwright test --reporter=html
By default, HTML report is opened automatically if some of the tests failed. You can control this behavior via the open property in the Playwright config or the PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN environmental variable. The possible values for that property are always, never and on-failure (default).
You can also configure host and port that are used to serve the HTML report.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: [['html', { open: 'never' }]],
});
By default, report is written into the playwright-report folder in the current working directory. One can override that location using the PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OUTPUT_DIR environment variable or a reporter configuration.
In configuration file, pass options directly:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: [['html', { outputFolder: 'my-report' }]],
});
If you are uploading attachments from data folder to other location, you can use attachmentsBaseURL option to let html report where to look for them.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: [['html', { attachmentsBaseURL: 'https://external-storage.com/' }]],
});
A quick way of opening the last test run report is:
npx playwright show-report
Or if there is a custom folder name:
npx playwright show-report my-report
HTML report supports the following configuration options and environment variables:
Environment Variable Name
Reporter Config Option
Description
Default
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_TITLE
title
A title to display in the generated report.
No title is displayed by default
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OUTPUT_DIR
outputFolder
Directory to save the report to.
playwright-report
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN
open
When to open the html report in the browser, one of 'always', 'never' or 'on-failure'
'on-failure'
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_HOST
host
When report opens in the browser, it will be served bound to this hostname.
localhost
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_PORT
port
When report opens in the browser, it will be served on this port.
9323 or any available port when 9323 is not available.
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_ATTACHMENTS_BASE_URL
attachmentsBaseURL
A separate location where attachments from the data subdirectory are uploaded. Only needed when you upload report and data separately to different locations.
data/
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_NO_SNIPPETS
noSnippets
If true, disable rendering code snippets in the action log. If there is a top level error, that report section with code snippet will still render. Supports true, 1, false, and 0.
false

Blob reporter
Blob reports contain all the details about the test run and can be used later to produce any other report. Their primary function is to facilitate the merging of reports from sharded tests.
npx playwright test --reporter=blob
By default, the report is written into the blob-report directory in the package.json directory or current working directory (if no package.json is found). The report file name looks like report-<hash>.zip or report-<hash>-<shard_number>.zip when sharding is used. The hash is an optional value computed from --grep, --grepInverted, --project and file filters passed as command line arguments. The hash guarantees that running Playwright with different command line options will produce different but stable between runs report names. The output file name can be overridden in the configuration file or pass as 'PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_FILE' environment variable.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: [['blob', { outputFile: `./blob-report/report-${os.platform()}.zip` }]],
});
Blob report supports following configuration options and environment variables:
Environment Variable Name
Reporter Config Option
Description
Default
PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_DIR
outputDir
Directory to save the output. Existing content is deleted before writing the new report.
blob-report
PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_NAME
fileName
Report file name.
report-<project>-<hash>-<shard_number>.zip
PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_FILE
outputFile
Full path to the output file. If defined, outputDir and fileName will be ignored.
undefined

JSON reporter
JSON reporter produces an object with all information about the test run.
Most likely you want to write the JSON to a file. When running with --reporter=json, use PLAYWRIGHT_JSON_OUTPUT_NAME environment variable:
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
PLAYWRIGHT_JSON_OUTPUT_NAME=results.json npx playwright test --reporter=json
In configuration file, pass options directly:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: [['json', { outputFile: 'results.json' }]],
});
JSON report supports following configuration options and environment variables:
Environment Variable Name
Reporter Config Option
Description
Default
PLAYWRIGHT_JSON_OUTPUT_DIR


Directory to save the output file. Ignored if output file is specified.
cwd or config directory.
PLAYWRIGHT_JSON_OUTPUT_NAME
outputFile
Base file name for the output, relative to the output dir.
JSON report is printed to the stdout.
PLAYWRIGHT_JSON_OUTPUT_FILE
outputFile
Full path to the output file. If defined, PLAYWRIGHT_JSON_OUTPUT_DIR and PLAYWRIGHT_JSON_OUTPUT_NAME will be ignored.
JSON report is printed to the stdout.

JUnit reporter
JUnit reporter produces a JUnit-style xml report.
Most likely you want to write the report to an xml file. When running with --reporter=junit, use PLAYWRIGHT_JUNIT_OUTPUT_NAME environment variable:
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
PLAYWRIGHT_JUNIT_OUTPUT_NAME=results.xml npx playwright test --reporter=junit
In configuration file, pass options directly:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: [['junit', { outputFile: 'results.xml' }]],
});
JUnit report supports following configuration options and environment variables:
Environment Variable Name

JUnit report is printed to the stdout.
PLAYWRIGHT_JUNIT_STRIP_ANSI
stripANSIControlSequences
Whether to remove ANSI control sequences from the text before writing it in the report.
By default output text is added as is.
PLAYWRIGHT_JUNIT_INCLUDE_PROJECT_IN_TEST_NAME
includeProjectInTestName
Whether to include Playwright project name in every test case as a name prefix.
By default not included.

PLAYWRIGHT_JUNIT_SUITE_NAME


Value of the name attribute on the root <testsuites/> report entry.
Empty string.

GitHub Actions annotations
You can use the built in github reporter to get automatic failure annotations when running in GitHub actions.
Note that all other reporters work on GitHub Actions as well, but do not provide annotations. Also, it is not recommended to use this annotation type if running your tests with a matrix strategy as the stack trace failures will multiply and obscure the GitHub file view.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // 'github' for GitHub Actions CI to generate annotations, plus a concise 'dot'
 // default 'list' when running locally
 reporter: process.env.CI ? 'github' : 'list',
});
Custom reporters
You can create a custom reporter by implementing a class with some of the reporter methods. Learn more about the Reporter API.
my-awesome-reporter.ts
import type {
 FullConfig, FullResult, Reporter, Suite, TestCase, TestResult
} from '@playwright/test/reporter';

class MyReporter implements Reporter {
 onBegin(config: FullConfig, suite: Suite) {
   console.log(`Starting the run with ${suite.allTests().length} tests`);
 }

 onTestBegin(test: TestCase, result: TestResult) {
   console.log(`Starting test ${test.title}`);
 }

 onTestEnd(test: TestCase, result: TestResult) {
   console.log(`Finished test ${test.title}: ${result.status}`);
 }

 onEnd(result: FullResult) {
   console.log(`Finished the run: ${result.status}`);
 }
}

export default MyReporter;
Now use this reporter with testConfig.reporter.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: './my-awesome-reporter.ts',
});
Or just pass the reporter file path as --reporter command line option:
npx playwright test --reporter="./myreporter/my-awesome-reporter.ts"

Retries
Introduction
Test retries are a way to automatically re-run a test when it fails. This is useful when a test is flaky and fails intermittently. Test retries are configured in the configuration file.
Failures
Playwright Test runs tests in worker processes. These processes are OS processes, running independently, orchestrated by the test runner. All workers have identical environments and each starts its own browser.
Consider the following snippet:
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('suite', () => {
 test.beforeAll(async () => { /* ... */ });
 test('first good', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
 test('second flaky', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
 test('third good', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
 test.afterAll(async () => { /* ... */ });
});
When all tests pass, they will run in order in the same worker process.
Worker process starts
beforeAll hook runs
first good passes
second flaky passes
third good passes
afterAll hook runs
Should any test fail, Playwright Test will discard the entire worker process along with the browser and will start a new one. Testing will continue in the new worker process starting with the next test.
Worker process #1 starts
beforeAll hook runs
first good passes
second flaky fails
afterAll hook runs
Worker process #2 starts
beforeAll hook runs again
third good passes
afterAll hook runs
If you enable retries, second worker process will start by retrying the failed test and continue from there.
Worker process #1 starts
beforeAll hook runs
first good passes
second flaky fails
afterAll hook runs
Worker process #2 starts
beforeAll hook runs again
second flaky is retried and passes
third good passes
afterAll hook runs
This scheme works perfectly for independent tests and guarantees that failing tests can't affect healthy ones.
Retries
Playwright supports test retries. When enabled, failing tests will be retried multiple times until they pass, or until the maximum number of retries is reached. By default failing tests are not retried.
# Give failing tests 3 retry attempts
npx playwright test --retries=3
You can configure retries in the configuration file:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // Give failing tests 3 retry attempts
 retries: 3,
});
Playwright Test will categorize tests as follows:
"passed" - tests that passed on the first run;
"flaky" - tests that failed on the first run, but passed when retried;
"failed" - tests that failed on the first run and failed all retries.
Running 3 tests using 1 worker

 â example.spec.ts:4:2 âº first passes (438ms)
 x example.spec.ts:5:2 âº second flaky (691ms)
 â example.spec.ts:5:2 âº second flaky (522ms)
 â example.spec.ts:6:2 âº third passes (932ms)

 1 flaky
   example.spec.ts:5:2 âº second flaky
 2 passed (4s)
You can detect retries at runtime with testInfo.retry, which is accessible to any test, hook or fixture. Here is an example that clears some server-side state before a retry.
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('my test', async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
 if (testInfo.retry)
   await cleanSomeCachesOnTheServer();
 // ...
});
You can specify retries for a specific group of tests or a single file with test.describe.configure().
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe(() => {
 // All tests in this describe group will get 2 retry attempts.
 test.describe.configure({ retries: 2 });

 test('test 1', async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });

 test('test 2', async ({ page }) => {
   // ...
 });
});
Serial mode
Use test.describe.serial() to group dependent tests to ensure they will always run together and in order. If one of the tests fails, all subsequent tests are skipped. All tests in the group are retried together.
Consider the following snippet that uses test.describe.serial:
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' });

test.beforeAll(async () => { /* ... */ });
test('first good', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
test('second flaky', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
test('third good', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
When running without retries, all tests after the failure are skipped:
Worker process #1:
beforeAll hook runs
first good passes
second flaky fails
third good is skipped entirely
When running with retries, all tests are retried together:
Worker process #1:
beforeAll hook runs
first good passes
second flaky fails
third good is skipped
Worker process #2:
beforeAll hook runs again
first good passes again
second flaky passes
third good passes
NOTE
It is usually better to make your tests isolated, so they can be efficiently run and retried independently.
Reuse single page between tests
Playwright Test creates an isolated Page object for each test. However, if you'd like to reuse a single Page object between multiple tests, you can create your own in test.beforeAll() and close it in test.afterAll().
TypeScript
JavaScript
example.spec.ts
import { test, type Page } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' });

let page: Page;

test.beforeAll(async ({ browser }) => {
 page = await browser.newPage();
});

test.afterAll(async () => {
 await page.close();
});

test('runs first', async () => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
});

test('runs second', async () => {
 await page.getByText('Get Started').click();
});

Sharding
Introduction
By default, Playwright runs test files in parallel and strives for optimal utilization of CPU cores on your machine. In order to achieve even greater parallelisation, you can further scale Playwright test execution by running tests on multiple machines simultaneously. We call this mode of operation "sharding". Sharding in Playwright means splitting your tests into smaller parts called "shards". Each shard is like a separate job that can run independently. The whole purpose is to divide your tests to speed up test runtime.
When you shard your tests, each shard can run on its own, utilizing the available CPU cores. This helps speed up the testing process by doing tasks simultaneously.
In a CI pipeline, each shard can run as a separate job, making use of the hardware resources available in your CI pipeline, like CPU cores, to run tests faster.
Sharding tests between multiple machines
To shard the test suite, pass --shard=x/y to the command line. For example, to split the suite into four shards, each running one fourth of the tests:
npx playwright test --shard=1/4
npx playwright test --shard=2/4
npx playwright test --shard=3/4
npx playwright test --shard=4/4
Now, if you run these shards in parallel on different jobs, your test suite completes four times faster.
Note that Playwright can only shard tests that can be run in parallel. By default, this means Playwright will shard test files. Learn about other options in the parallelism guide.
Balancing Shards
Sharding can be done at two levels of granularity depending on whether you use the testProject.fullyParallel option or not. This affects how the tests are balanced across the shards.
Sharding with fullyParallel
When fullyParallel: true is enabled, Playwright Test runs individual tests in parallel across multiple shards, ensuring each shard receives an even distribution of tests. This allows for test-level granularity, meaning each shard will attempt to balance the number of individual tests it runs. This is the preferred mode for ensuring even load distribution when sharding, as Playwright can optimize shard execution based on the total number of tests.
Sharding without fullyParallel
Without the fullyParallel setting, Playwright Test defaults to file-level granularity, meaning entire test files are assigned to shards (note that the same file may be assigned to different shards across different projects). In this case, the number of tests per file can greatly influence shard distribution. If your test files are not evenly sized (i.e., some files contain many more tests than others), certain shards may end up running significantly more tests, while others may run fewer or even none.
Key Takeaways:
With fullyParallel: true: Tests are split at the individual test level, leading to more balanced shard execution.
Without fullyParallel: Tests are split at the file level, so to balance the shards, it's important to keep your test files small and evenly sized.
To ensure the most effective use of sharding, especially in CI environments, it is recommended to use fullyParallel: true when aiming for balanced distribution across shards. Otherwise, you may need to manually organize your test files to avoid imbalances.
Merging reports from multiple shards
In the previous example, each test shard has its own test report. If you want to have a combined report showing all the test results from all the shards, you can merge them.
Start with adding blob reporter to the config when running on CI:
playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
 testDir: './tests',
 reporter: process.env.CI ? 'blob' : 'html',
});
Blob report contains information about all the tests that were run and their results as well as all test attachments such as traces and screenshot diffs. Blob reports can be merged and converted to any other Playwright report. By default, blob report will be generated into blob-report directory.
To merge reports from multiple shards, put the blob report files into a single directory, for example all-blob-reports. Blob report names contain shard number, so they will not clash.
Afterwards, run npx playwright merge-reports command:
npx playwright merge-reports --reporter html ./all-blob-reports
This will produce a standard HTML report into playwright-report directory.
GitHub Actions example
GitHub Actions supports sharding tests between multiple jobs using the jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix option. The matrix option will run a separate job for every possible combination of the provided options.
The following example shows you how to configure a job to run your tests on four machines in parallel and then merge the reports into a single report. Don't forget to add reporter: process.env.CI ? 'blob' : 'html', to your playwright.config.ts file as in the example above.
First we add a matrix option to our job configuration with the shardTotal: [4] option containing the total number of shards we want to create and shardIndex: [1, 2, 3, 4] with an array of the shard numbers.
Then we run our Playwright tests with the --shard=${{ matrix.shardIndex }}/${{ matrix.shardTotal }} option. This will run our test command for each shard.
Finally we upload our blob report to the GitHub Actions Artifacts. This will make the blob report available to other jobs in the workflow.
.github/workflows/playwright.yml

   branches: [ main, master ]

   strategy:
     fail-fast: false
     matrix:
       shardIndex: [1, 2, 3, 4]
       shardTotal: [4]
   steps:
   - uses: actions/checkout@v4
   - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
     with:
       node-version: lts/*

     run: npm ci
   - name: Install Playwright browsers
     run: npx playwright install --with-deps

   - name: Run Playwright tests
     run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shardIndex }}/${{ matrix.shardTotal }}

   - name: Upload blob report to GitHub Actions Artifacts
     if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
     uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
     with:
       name: blob-report-${{ matrix.shardIndex }}
       path: blob-report
       retention-days: 1
After all shards have completed, you can run a separate job that will merge the reports and produce a combined HTML report. To ensure the execution order, we make the merge-reports job depend on our sharded playwright-tests job by adding needs: [playwright-tests].
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
jobs:
...
 merge-reports:
   # Merge reports after playwright-tests, even if some shards have failed
   if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
   needs: [playwright-tests]

   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
   - uses: actions/checkout@v4
   - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
     with:
       node-version: lts/*
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: npm ci

   - name: Download blob reports from GitHub Actions Artifacts
     uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
     with:
       path: all-blob-reports
       pattern: blob-report-*
       merge-multiple: true

   - name: Merge into HTML Report
     run: npx playwright merge-reports --reporter html ./all-blob-reports

   - name: Upload HTML report
     uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
     with:
       name: html-report--attempt-${{ github.run_attempt }}
       path: playwright-report
       retention-days: 14
You can now see the reports have been merged and a combined HTML report is available in the GitHub Actions Artifacts tab.

Merge-reports CLI
npx playwright merge-reports path/to/blob-reports-dir reads all blob reports from the passed directory and merges them into a single report.
When merging reports from different OS'es you'll have to provide an explicit merge config to disambiguate which directory should be used as tests root.
Supported options:
--reporter reporter-to-use
Which report to produce. Can be multiple reporters separated by comma.
Example:
npx playwright merge-reports --reporter=html,github ./blob-reports
--config path/to/config/file
Specifies the Playwright configuration file with output reporters. Use this option to pass additional configuration to the output reporter. This configuration file can differ from the one used during the creation of blob reports.
Example:
npx playwright merge-reports --config=merge.config.ts ./blob-reports
merge.config.ts
export default {
 testDir: 'e2e',
 reporter: [['html', { open: 'never' }]],
};

Timeouts
Playwright Test has multiple configurable timeouts for various tasks.
Timeout
Default
Description
Test timeout
30_000 ms
Timeout for each test
SET IN CONFIG
{ timeout: 60_000 }
OVERRIDE IN TEST
test.setTimeout(120_000)
Expect timeout
5_000 ms
Timeout for each assertion
SET IN CONFIG
{ expect: { timeout: 10_000 } }
OVERRIDE IN TEST
expect(locator).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10_000 })

Test timeout
Playwright Test enforces a timeout for each test, 30 seconds by default. Time spent by the test function, fixture setups, and beforeEach hooks is included in the test timeout.
Timed out test produces the following error:
example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test ===========================

Timeout of 30000ms exceeded.
Additional separate timeout, of the same value, is shared between fixture teardowns and afterEach hooks, after the test function has finished.
The same timeout value also applies to beforeAll and afterAll hooks, but they do not share time with any test.
Set test timeout in the config
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 timeout: 120_000,
});
API reference: testConfig.timeout.
Set timeout for a single test
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('slow test', async ({ page }) => {
 test.slow(); // Easy way to triple the default timeout
 // ...
});

test('very slow test', async ({ page }) => {
 test.setTimeout(120_000);
 // ...
});
API reference: test.setTimeout() and test.slow().
Change timeout from a beforeEach hook
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
 // Extend timeout for all tests running this hook by 30 seconds.
 testInfo.setTimeout(testInfo.timeout + 30_000);
});
API reference: testInfo.setTimeout().
Change timeout for beforeAll/afterAll hook
beforeAll and afterAll hooks have a separate timeout, by default equal to test timeout. You can change it separately for each hook by calling testInfo.setTimeout() inside the hook.
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.beforeAll(async () => {
 // Set timeout for this hook.
 test.setTimeout(60000);
});
API reference: testInfo.setTimeout().
Expect timeout
Auto-retrying assertions like expect(locator).toHaveText() have a separate timeout, 5 seconds by default. Assertion timeout is unrelated to the test timeout. It produces the following error:
example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test ===========================

Error: expect(received).toHaveText(expected)

Expected string: "my text"
Received string: ""
Call log:
 - expect.toHaveText with timeout 5000ms
 - waiting for "locator('button')"
Set expect timeout in the config
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 expect: {
   timeout: 10_000,
 },
});
API reference: testConfig.expect.
Specify expect timeout for a single assertion
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('example', async ({ page }) => {
 await expect(locator).toHaveText('hello', { timeout: 10_000 });
});
Global timeout
Playwright Test supports a timeout for the whole test run. This prevents excess resource usage when everything went wrong. There is no default global timeout, but you can set a reasonable one in the config, for example one hour. Global timeout produces the following error:
Running 1000 tests using 10 workers

 514 skipped
 486 passed
 Timed out waiting 3600s for the entire test run
You can set global timeout in the config.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 globalTimeout: 3_600_000,
});
API reference: testConfig.globalTimeout.
Advanced: low level timeouts
These are the low-level timeouts that are pre-configured by the test runner, you should not need to change these. If you happen to be in this section because your test are flaky, it is very likely that you should be looking for the solution elsewhere.
Timeout
Default
Description
Action timeout
no timeout
Timeout for each action
SET IN CONFIG
{ use: { actionTimeout: 10_000 } }
OVERRIDE IN TEST
locator.click({ timeout: 10_000 })
Navigation timeout
no timeout
Timeout for each navigation action
SET IN CONFIG
{ use: { navigationTimeout: 30_000 } }
OVERRIDE IN TEST
page.goto('/', { timeout: 30_000 })
Global timeout
no timeout
Global timeout for the whole test run
SET IN CONFIG
{ globalTimeout: 3_600_000 }
beforeAll/afterAll timeout
30_000 ms
Timeout for the hook
SET IN HOOK
test.setTimeout(60_000)
Fixture timeout
no timeout
Timeout for an individual fixture
SET IN FIXTURE
{ scope: 'test', timeout: 30_000 }

Set action and navigation timeouts in the config
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   actionTimeout: 10 * 1000,
   navigationTimeout: 30 * 1000,
 },
});
API reference: testOptions.actionTimeout and testOptions.navigationTimeout.
Set timeout for a single action
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev', { timeout: 30000 });
 await page.getByText('Get Started').click({ timeout: 10000 });
});
Fixture timeout
By default, fixture shares timeout with the test. However, for slow fixtures, especially worker-scoped ones, it is convenient to have a separate timeout. This way you can keep the overall test timeout small, and give the slow fixture more time.
example.spec.ts
import { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/test';

const test = base.extend<{ slowFixture: string }>({
 slowFixture: [async ({}, use) => {
   // ... perform a slow operation ...
   await use('hello');
 }, { timeout: 60_000 }]
});

test('example test', async ({ slowFixture }) => {
 // ...
});
API reference: test.extend().

TypeScript
Introduction
Playwright supports TypeScript out of the box. You just write tests in TypeScript, and Playwright will read them, transform to JavaScript and run.
Note that Playwright does not check the types and will run tests even if there are non-critical TypeScript compilation errors. We recommend you run TypeScript compiler alongside Playwright. For example on GitHub actions:
jobs:
 test:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
   ...
   - name: Run type checks
     run: npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit
   - name: Run Playwright tests
     run: npx playwright test
For local development, you can run tsc in watch mode like this:
npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit -w
tsconfig.json
Playwright will pick up tsconfig.json for each source file it loads. Note that Playwright only supports the following tsconfig options: allowJs, baseUrl, paths and references.
We recommend setting up a separate tsconfig.json in the tests directory so that you can change some preferences specifically for the tests. Here is an example directory structure.
src/
   source.ts

tests/
   tsconfig.json  # test-specific tsconfig
   example.spec.ts

tsconfig.json  # generic tsconfig for all typescript sources

playwright.config.ts
tsconfig path mapping
Playwright supports path mapping declared in the tsconfig.json. Make sure that baseUrl is also set.
Here is an example tsconfig.json that works with Playwright:
tsconfig.json
{
 "compilerOptions": {
   "baseUrl": ".",
   "paths": {
     "@myhelper/*": ["packages/myhelper/*"] // This mapping is relative to "baseUrl".
   }
 }
}
You can now import using the mapped paths:
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { username, password } from '@myhelper/credentials';

test('example', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.getByLabel('User Name').fill(username);
 await page.getByLabel('Password').fill(password);
});
tsconfig resolution
By default, Playwright will look up a closest tsconfig for each imported file by going up the directory structure and looking for tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json. This way, you can create a tests/tsconfig.json file that will be used only for your tests and Playwright will pick it up automatically.
# Playwright will choose tsconfig automatically
npx playwright test
Alternatively, you can specify a single tsconfig file to use in the command line, and Playwright will use it for all imported files, not only test files.
# Pass a specific tsconfig
npx playwright test --tsconfig=tsconfig.test.json
You can specify a single tsconfig file in the config file, that will be used for loading test files, reporters, etc. However, it will not be used while loading the playwright config itself or any files imported from it.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 tsconfig: './tsconfig.test.json',
});
Manually compile tests with TypeScript
Sometimes, Playwright Test will not be able to transform your TypeScript code correctly, for example when you are using experimental or very recent features of TypeScript, usually configured in tsconfig.json.
In this case, you can perform your own TypeScript compilation before sending the tests to Playwright.
First add a tsconfig.json file inside the tests directory:
{
   "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "ESNext",
       "module": "commonjs",
       "moduleResolution": "Node",
       "sourceMap": true,
       "outDir": "../tests-out",
   }
}
In package.json, add two scripts:
{
 "scripts": {
   "pretest": "tsc --incremental -p tests/tsconfig.json",
   "test": "playwright test -c tests-out"
 }
}
The pretest script runs typescript on the tests. test will run the tests that have been generated to the tests-out directory. The -c argument configures the test runner to look for tests inside the tests-out directory.
Then npm run test will build the tests and run them.

UI Mode
Introduction
UI Mode lets you explore, run, and debug tests with a time travel experience complete with a watch mode. All test files are displayed in the testing sidebar, allowing you to expand each file and describe block to individually run, view, watch, and debug each test. Filter tests by name, projects (set in your playwright.config file), @tag, or by the execution status of passed, failed, and skipped. See a full trace of your tests and hover back and forward over each action to see what was happening during each step. You can also pop out the DOM snapshot of a given moment into a separate window for a better debugging experience.
Opening UI Mode
To open UI mode, run the following command in your terminal:
npx playwright test --ui
Running your tests
Once you launch UI Mode you will see a list of all your test files. You can run all your tests by clicking the triangle icon in the sidebar. You can also run a single test file, a block of tests or a single test by hovering over the name and clicking on the triangle next to it.

Filtering tests
Filter tests by text or @tag or by passed, failed or skipped tests. You can also filter by projects as set in your playwright.config file. If you are using project dependencies make sure to run your setup tests first before running the tests that depend on them. The UI mode will not take into consideration the setup tests and therefore you will have to manually run them first.

Timeline view
At the top of the trace you can see a timeline view of your test with different colors to highlight navigation and actions. Hover back and forth to see an image snapshot for each action. Double click on an action to see the time range for that action. You can use the slider in the timeline to increase the actions selected and these will be shown in the Actions tab and all console logs and network logs will be filtered to only show the logs for the actions selected.

Actions
In the Actions tab you can see what locator was used for every action and how long each one took to run. Hover over each action of your test and visually see the change in the DOM snapshot. Go back and forward in time and click an action to inspect and debug. Use the Before and After tabs to visually see what happened before and after the action. 
Pop out and inspect the DOM
Pop out the DOM snapshot into its own window for a better debugging experience by clicking on the pop out icon above the DOM snapshot. From there you can open the browser DevTools and inspect the HTML, CSS, Console etc. Go back to UI Mode and click on another action and pop that one out to easily compare the two side by side or debug each individually.

Pick locator
Click on the pick locator button and hover over the DOM snapshot to see the locator for each element highlighted as you hover. Click on an element to add the locator playground. You can modify the locator in the playground and see if your modified locator matches any locators in the DOM snapshot. Once you are satisfied with the locator you can use the copy button to copy the locator and paste it into your test.

Source
As you hover over each action of your test the line of code for that action is highlighted in the source panel. The button "Open in VSCode" is at the top-right of this section. Upon clicking the button, it will open your test in VS Code right at the line of code that you clicked on.

Call
The call tab shows you information about the action such as the time it took, what locator was used, if in strict mode and what key was used.

Log
See a full log of your test to better understand what Playwright is doing behind the scenes such as scrolling into view, waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable and performing actions such as click, fill, press etc.

Errors
If your test fails you will see the error messages for each test in the Errors tab. The timeline will also show a red line highlighting where the error occurred. You can also click on the source tab to see on which line of the source code the error is.

Console
See console logs from the browser as well as from your test. Different icons are displayed to show you if the console log came from the browser or from the test file.

Network
The Network tab shows you all the network requests that were made during your test. You can sort by different types of requests, status code, method, request, content type, duration and size. Click on a request to see more information about it such as the request headers, response headers, request body and response body.

Attachments
The "Attachments" tab allows you to explore attachments. If you're doing visual regression testing, you'll be able to compare screenshots by examining the image diff, the actual image and the expected image. When you click on the expected image you can use the slider to slide one image over the other so you can easily see the differences in your screenshots.

Metadata
Next to the Actions tab you will find the Metadata tab which will show you more information on your test such as the Browser, viewport size, test duration and more.

Watch mode
Next to the name of each test in the sidebar you will find an eye icon. Clicking on the icon will activate watch mode which will re-run the test when you make changes to it. You can watch a number of tests at the same time be clicking the eye icon next to each one or all tests by clicking the eye icon at the top of the sidebar.

Docker & GitHub Codespaces
For Docker and GitHub Codespaces environments, you can run UI mode in the browser. In order for an endpoint to be accessible outside of the container, it needs to be bound to the 0.0.0.0 interface:
npx playwright test --ui-host=0.0.0.0
In the case of GitHub Codespaces, the port gets forwarded automatically, so you can open UI mode in the browser by clicking on the link in the terminal.
To have a static port, you can pass the --ui-port flag:
npx playwright test --ui-port=8080 --ui-host=0.0.0.0
NOTE
Be aware that when specifying the --ui-host=0.0.0.0 flag, UI Mode with your traces, the passwords and secrets is accessible from other machines inside your network. In the case of GitHub Codespaces, the ports are only accessible from your account by default.

Web server
Introduction
Playwright comes with a webserver option in the config file which gives you the ability to launch a local dev server before running your tests. This is ideal for when writing your tests during development and when you don't have a staging or production url to test against.
Configuring a web server
Use the webserver property in your Playwright config to launch a development web server during the tests.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // Run your local dev server before starting the tests
 webServer: {
   command: 'npm run start',
   url: 'http://localhost:3000',
   reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
   stdout: 'ignore',
   stderr: 'pipe',
 },
});
Property
Description
testConfig.webServer
Launch a development web server (or multiple) during the tests.
command
Shell command to start the local dev server of your app.
cwd
Current working directory of the spawned process, defaults to the directory of the configuration file.
env
Environment variables to set for the command, process.env by default.
gracefulShutdown
How to shut down the process. If unspecified, the process group is forcefully SIGKILLed. If set to { signal: 'SIGTERM', timeout: 500 }, the process group is sent a SIGTERM signal, followed by SIGKILL if it doesn't exit within 500ms. You can also use SIGINT as the signal instead. A 0 timeout means no SIGKILL will be sent. Windows doesn't support SIGTERM and SIGINT signals, so this option is ignored on Windows. Note that shutting down a Docker container requires SIGTERM.
ignoreHTTPSErrors
Whether to ignore HTTPS errors when fetching the url. Defaults to false.
name
Specifies a custom name for the web server. This name will be prefixed to log messages. Defaults to [WebServer].
reuseExistingServer
If true, it will re-use an existing server on the url when available. If no server is running on that url, it will run the command to start a new server. If false, it will throw if an existing process is listening on the url. To see the stdout, you can set the DEBUG=pw:webserver environment variable.
stderr
Whether to pipe the stderr of the command to the process stderr or ignore it. Defaults to "pipe".
stdout
If "pipe", it will pipe the stdout of the command to the process stdout. If "ignore", it will ignore the stdout of the command. Default to "ignore".
timeout
How long to wait for the process to start up and be available in milliseconds. Defaults to 60000.
url
URL of your http server that is expected to return a 2xx, 3xx, 400, 401, 402, or 403 status code when the server is ready to accept connections.

Adding a server timeout
Webservers can sometimes take longer to boot up. In this case, you can increase the timeout to wait for the server to start.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // Rest of your config...

 // Run your local dev server before starting the tests
 webServer: {
   command: 'npm run start',
   url: 'http://localhost:3000',
   reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
   timeout: 120 * 1000,
 },
});
Adding a baseURL
It is also recommended to specify the baseURL in the use: {} section of your config, so that tests can use relative urls and you don't have to specify the full URL over and over again.
When using page.goto(), page.route(), page.waitForURL(), page.waitForRequest(), or page.waitForResponse() it takes the base URL in consideration by using the URL() constructor for building the corresponding URL. For Example, by setting the baseURL to http://localhost:3000 and navigating to /login in your tests, Playwright will run the test using http://localhost:3000/login.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // Rest of your config...

 // Run your local dev server before starting the tests
 webServer: {
   command: 'npm run start',
   url: 'http://localhost:3000',
   reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
 },
 use: {
   baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
 },
});
Now you can use a relative path when navigating the page:
test.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
 // This will navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
 await page.goto('./login');
});
Multiple web servers
Multiple web servers (or background processes) can be launched simultaneously by providing an array of webServer configurations. See testConfig.webServer for more info.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 webServer: [
   {
     command: 'npm run start',
     url: 'http://localhost:3000',
     name: 'Frontend',
     timeout: 120 * 1000,
     reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
   },
   {
     command: 'npm run backend',
     url: 'http://localhost:3333',
     name: 'Backend',
     timeout: 120 * 1000,
     reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
   }
 ],
 use: {
   baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
 },
});

Library
Introduction
Playwright Library provides unified APIs for launching and interacting with browsers, while Playwright Test provides all this plus a fully managed end-to-end Test Runner and experience.
Under most circumstances, for end-to-end testing, you'll want to use @playwright/test (Playwright Test), and not playwright (Playwright Library) directly. To get started with Playwright Test, follow the Getting Started Guide.
Differences when using library
Library Example
The following is an example of using the Playwright Library directly to launch Chromium, go to a page, and check its title:
TypeScript
JavaScript
import { chromium, devices } from 'playwright';
import assert from 'node:assert';

(async () => {
 // Setup
 const browser = await chromium.launch();
 const context = await browser.newContext(devices['iPhone 11']);
 const page = await context.newPage();

 // The actual interesting bit
 await context.route('**.jpg', route => route.abort());
 await page.goto('https://example.com/');

 assert(await page.title() === 'Example Domain'); // ð not a Web First assertion

 // Teardown
 await context.close();
 await browser.close();
})();
Run it with node my-script.js.
Test Example
A test to achieve similar behavior, would look like:
TypeScript
JavaScript
import { expect, test, devices } from '@playwright/test';

test.use(devices['iPhone 11']);

test('should be titled', async ({ page, context }) => {
 await context.route('**.jpg', route => route.abort());
 await page.goto('https://example.com/');

 await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Example');
});
Run it with npx playwright test.
Key Differences
The key differences to note are as follows:


Library
Test
Installation
npm install playwright
npm init playwright@latest - note install vs. init
Install browsers
Install @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox and/or @playwright/browser-webkit
npx playwright install or npx playwright install chromium for a single one
import from
playwright
@playwright/test
Initialization
Explicitly need to:
Pick a browser to use, e.g. chromium
Launch browser with browserType.launch()
Create a context with browser.newContext(), and pass any context options explicitly, e.g. devices['iPhone 11']
Create a page with browserContext.newPage()
An isolated page and context are provided to each test out-of the box, along with other built-in fixtures. No explicit creation. If referenced by the test in its arguments, the Test Runner will create them for the test. (i.e. lazy-initialization)
Assertions
No built-in Web-First Assertions
Web-First assertions like:
expect(page).toHaveTitle()
expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()
which auto-wait and retry for the condition to be met.
Timeouts
Defaults to 30s for most operations.
Most operations don't time out, but every test has a timeout that makes it fail (30s by default).
Cleanup
Explicitly need to:
Close context with browserContext.close()
Close browser with browser.close()
No explicit close of built-in fixtures; the Test Runner will take care of it.
Running
When using the Library, you run the code as a node script, possibly with some compilation first.
When using the Test Runner, you use the npx playwright test command. Along with your config, the Test Runner handles any compilation and choosing what to run and how to run it.

In addition to the above, Playwright Test, as a full-featured Test Runner, includes:
Configuration Matrix and Projects: In the above example, in the Playwright Library version, if we wanted to run with a different device or browser, we'd have to modify the script and plumb the information through. With Playwright Test, we can just specify the matrix of configurations in one place, and it will create run the one test under each of these configurations.
Parallelization
Web-First Assertions
Reporting
Retries

and moreâ¦
Usage
Use npm or Yarn to install Playwright library in your Node.js project. See system requirements.
npm i -D playwright
You will also need to install browsers - either manually or by adding a package that will do it for you automatically.
# Download the Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browser
npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit

# Alternatively, add packages that will download a browser upon npm install
npm i -D @playwright/browser-chromium @playwright/browser-firefox @playwright/browser-webkit
See managing browsers for more options.
Once installed, you can import Playwright in a Node.js script, and launch any of the 3 browsers (chromium, firefox and webkit).
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
 const browser = await chromium.launch();
 // Create pages, interact with UI elements, assert values
 await browser.close();
})();
Playwright APIs are asynchronous and return Promise objects. Our code examples use the async/await pattern to ease readability. The code is wrapped in an unnamed async arrow function which is invoking itself.
(async () => { // Start of async arrow function
 // Function code
 // ...
})(); // End of the function and () to invoke itself
First script
In our first script, we will navigate to https://playwright.dev/ and take a screenshot in WebKit.
const { webkit } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
 const browser = await webkit.launch();
 const page = await browser.newPage();
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
 await page.screenshot({ path: `example.png` });
 await browser.close();
})();
By default, Playwright runs the browsers in headless mode. To see the browser UI, pass the headless: false flag while launching the browser. You can also use slowMo to slow down execution. Learn more in the debugging tools section.
firefox.launch({ headless: false, slowMo: 50 });
Record scripts
Command line tools can be used to record user interactions and generate JavaScript code.
npx playwright codegen wikipedia.org
Browser downloads
To download Playwright browsers run:
# Explicitly download browsers
npx playwright install
Alternatively, you can add @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox and @playwright/browser-webkit packages to automatically download the respective browser during the package installation.
# Use a helper package that downloads a browser on npm install
npm install @playwright/browser-chromium
Download behind a firewall or a proxy
Pass HTTPS_PROXY environment variable to download through a proxy.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
# Manual
HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 npx playwright install

# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 npm install
Download from artifact repository
By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN. Pass PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST environment variable to download from an internal artifacts repository instead.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
# Manual
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1 npx playwright install

# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1 npm install
Skip browser download
In certain cases, it is desired to avoid browser downloads altogether because browser binaries are managed separately. This can be done by setting PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD variable before installing packages.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
# When using @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install
TypeScript support
Playwright includes built-in support for TypeScript. Type definitions will be imported automatically. It is recommended to use type-checking to improve the IDE experience.
In JavaScript
Add the following to the top of your JavaScript file to get type-checking in VS Code or WebStorm.
// @ts-check
// ...
Alternatively, you can use JSDoc to set types for variables.
/** @type {import('playwright').Page} */
let page;
In TypeScript
TypeScript support will work out-of-the-box. Types can also be imported explicitly.
let page: import('playwright').Page;

Introduction
Playwright can be used to test your application for many types of accessibility issues.
A few examples of problems this can catch include:
Text that would be hard to read for users with vision impairments due to poor color contrast with the background behind it
UI controls and form elements without labels that a screen reader could identify
Interactive elements with duplicate IDs which can confuse assistive technologies
The following examples rely on the @axe-core/playwright package which adds support for running the axe accessibility testing engine as part of your Playwright tests.
DISCLAIMER
Automated accessibility tests can detect some common accessibility problems such as missing or invalid properties. But many accessibility problems can only be discovered through manual testing. We recommend using a combination of automated testing, manual accessibility assessments, and inclusive user testing.
For manual assessments, we recommend Accessibility Insights for Web, a free and open source dev tool that walks you through assessing a website for WCAG 2.1 AA coverage.
Example accessibility tests
Accessibility tests work just like any other Playwright test. You can either create separate test cases for them, or integrate accessibility scans and assertions into your existing test cases.
The following examples demonstrate a few basic accessibility testing scenarios.
Scanning an entire page
This example demonstrates how to test an entire page for automatically detectable accessibility violations. The test:
Imports the @axe-core/playwright package
Uses normal Playwright Test syntax to define a test case
Uses normal Playwright syntax to navigate to the page under test
Awaits AxeBuilder.analyze() to run the accessibility scan against the page
Uses normal Playwright Test assertions to verify that there are no violations in the returned scan results
TypeScript
JavaScript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright'; // 1

test.describe('homepage', () => { // 2
 test('should not have any automatically detectable accessibility issues', async ({ page }) => {
   await page.goto('https://your-site.com/'); // 3

   const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze(); // 4

   expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]); // 5
 });
});
Configuring axe to scan a specific part of a page
@axe-core/playwright supports many configuration options for axe. You can specify these options by using a Builder pattern with the AxeBuilder class.
For example, you can use AxeBuilder.include() to constrain an accessibility scan to only run against one specific part of a page.
AxeBuilder.analyze() will scan the page in its current state when you call it. To scan parts of a page that are revealed based on UI interactions, use Locators to interact with the page before invoking analyze():
test('navigation menu should not have automatically detectable accessibility violations', async ({
 page,
}) => {
 await page.goto('https://your-site.com/');

 await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Navigation Menu' }).click();

 // It is important to waitFor() the page to be in the desired
 // state *before* running analyze(). Otherwise, axe might not
 // find all the elements your test expects it to scan.
 await page.locator('#navigation-menu-flyout').waitFor();

 const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
     .include('#navigation-menu-flyout')
     .analyze();

 expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
Scanning for WCAG violations
By default, axe checks against a wide variety of accessibility rules. Some of these rules correspond to specific success criteria from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and others are "best practice" rules that are not specifically required by any WCAG criterion.
You can constrain an accessibility scan to only run those rules which are "tagged" as corresponding to specific WCAG success criteria by using AxeBuilder.withTags(). For example, Accessibility Insights for Web's Automated Checks only include axe rules that test for violations of WCAG A and AA success criteria; to match that behavior, you would use the tags wcag2a, wcag2aa, wcag21a, and wcag21aa.
Note that automated testing cannot detect all types of WCAG violations.
test('should not have any automatically detectable WCAG A or AA violations', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://your-site.com/');

 const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
     .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21a', 'wcag21aa'])
     .analyze();

 expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
You can find a complete listing of the rule tags axe-core supports in the "Axe-core Tags" section of the axe API documentation.
Handling known issues
A common question when adding accessibility tests to an application is "how do I suppress known violations?" The following examples demonstrate a few techniques you can use.
Excluding individual elements from a scan
If your application contains a few specific elements with known issues, you can use AxeBuilder.exclude() to exclude them from being scanned until you're able to fix the issues.
This is usually the simplest option, but it has some important downsides:
exclude() will exclude the specified elements and all of their descendants. Avoid using it with components that contain many children.
exclude() will prevent all rules from running against the specified elements, not just the rules corresponding to known issues.
Here is an example of excluding one element from being scanned in one specific test:
test('should not have any accessibility violations outside of elements with known issues', async ({
 page,
}) => {
 await page.goto('https://your-site.com/page-with-known-issues');

 const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
     .exclude('#element-with-known-issue')
     .analyze();

 expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
If the element in question is used repeatedly in many pages, consider using a test fixture to reuse the same AxeBuilder configuration across multiple tests.
Disabling individual scan rules
If your application contains many different preexisting violations of a specific rule, you can use AxeBuilder.disableRules() to temporarily disable individual rules until you're able to fix the issues.
You can find the rule IDs to pass to disableRules() in the id property of the violations you want to suppress. A complete list of axe's rules can be found in axe-core's documentation.
test('should not have any accessibility violations outside of rules with known issues', async ({
 page,
}) => {
 await page.goto('https://your-site.com/page-with-known-issues');

 const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
     .disableRules(['duplicate-id'])
     .analyze();

 expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
Using snapshots to allow specific known issues
If you would like to allow for a more granular set of known issues, you can use Snapshots to verify that a set of preexisting violations has not changed. This approach avoids the downsides of using AxeBuilder.exclude() at the cost of slightly more complexity and fragility.
Do not use a snapshot of the entire accessibilityScanResults.violations array. It contains implementation details of the elements in question, such as a snippet of their rendered HTML; if you include these in your snapshots, it will make your tests prone to breaking every time one of the components in question changes for an unrelated reason:
// Don't do this! This is fragile.
expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toMatchSnapshot();
Instead, create a fingerprint of the violation(s) in question that contains only enough information to uniquely identify the issue, and use a snapshot of the fingerprint:
// This is less fragile than snapshotting the entire violations array.
expect(violationFingerprints(accessibilityScanResults)).toMatchSnapshot();

// my-test-utils.js
function violationFingerprints(accessibilityScanResults) {
 const violationFingerprints = accessibilityScanResults.violations.map(violation => ({
   rule: violation.id,
   // These are CSS selectors which uniquely identify each element with
   // a violation of the rule in question.
   targets: violation.nodes.map(node => node.target),
 }));

 return JSON.stringify(violationFingerprints, null, 2);
}
Exporting scan results as a test attachment
Most accessibility tests are primarily concerned with the violations property of the axe scan results. However, the scan results contain more than just violations. For example, the results also contain information about rules which passed and about elements which axe found to have inconclusive results for some rules. This information can be useful for debugging tests that aren't detecting all the violations you expect them to.
To include all of the scan results as part of your test results for debugging purposes, you can add the scan results as a test attachment with testInfo.attach(). Reporters can then embed or link the full results as part of your test output.
The following example demonstrates attaching scan results to a test:
test('example with attachment', async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
 await page.goto('https://your-site.com/');

 const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();

 await testInfo.attach('accessibility-scan-results', {
   body: JSON.stringify(accessibilityScanResults, null, 2),
   contentType: 'application/json'
 });

 expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
Using a test fixture for common axe configuration
Test fixtures are a good way to share common AxeBuilder configuration across many tests. Some scenarios where this might be useful include:
Using a common set of rules among all of your tests
Suppressing a known violation in a common element which appears in many different pages
Attaching standalone accessibility reports consistently for many scans
The following example demonstrates creating and using a test fixture that covers each of those scenarios.
Creating a fixture
This example fixture creates an AxeBuilder object which is pre-configured with shared withTags() and exclude() configuration.
TypeScript
JavaScript
axe-test.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright';

type AxeFixture = {
 makeAxeBuilder: () => AxeBuilder;
};

// Extend base test by providing "makeAxeBuilder"
//
// This new "test" can be used in multiple test files, and each of them will get
// a consistently configured AxeBuilder instance.
export const test = base.extend<AxeFixture>({
 makeAxeBuilder: async ({ page }, use) => {
   const makeAxeBuilder = () => new AxeBuilder({ page })
       .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21a', 'wcag21aa'])
       .exclude('#commonly-reused-element-with-known-issue');

   await use(makeAxeBuilder);
 }
});
export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
Using a fixture
To use the fixture, replace the earlier examples' new AxeBuilder({ page }) with the newly defined makeAxeBuilder fixture:
const { test, expect } = require('./axe-test');

test('example using custom fixture', async ({ page, makeAxeBuilder }) => {
 await page.goto('https://your-site.com/');

 const accessibilityScanResults = await makeAxeBuilder()
     // Automatically uses the shared AxeBuilder configuration,
     // but supports additional test-specific configuration too
     .include('#specific-element-under-test')
     .analyze();

 expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});

Introduction
Playwright can interact with HTML Input elements such as text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, select options, mouse clicks, type characters, keys and shortcuts as well as upload files and focus elements.
Text input
Using locator.fill() is the easiest way to fill out the form fields. It focuses the element and triggers an input event with the entered text. It works for <input>, <textarea> and [contenteditable] elements.
// Text input
await page.getByRole('textbox').fill('Peter');

// Date input
await page.getByLabel('Birth date').fill('2020-02-02');

// Time input
await page.getByLabel('Appointment time').fill('13:15');

// Local datetime input
await page.getByLabel('Local time').fill('2020-03-02T05:15');
Checkboxes and radio buttons
Using locator.setChecked() is the easiest way to check and uncheck a checkbox or a radio button. This method can be used with input[type=checkbox], input[type=radio] and [role=checkbox] elements.
// Check the checkbox
await page.getByLabel('I agree to the terms above').check();

// Assert the checked state
expect(page.getByLabel('Subscribe to newsletter')).toBeChecked();

// Select the radio button
await page.getByLabel('XL').check();
Select options
Selects one or multiple options in the <select> element with locator.selectOption(). You can specify option value, or label to select. Multiple options can be selected.
// Single selection matching the value or label
await page.getByLabel('Choose a color').selectOption('blue');

// Single selection matching the label
await page.getByLabel('Choose a color').selectOption({ label: 'Blue' });

// Multiple selected items
await page.getByLabel('Choose multiple colors').selectOption(['red', 'green', 'blue']);
Mouse click
Performs a simple human click.
// Generic click
await page.getByRole('button').click();

// Double click
await page.getByText('Item').dblclick();

// Right click
await page.getByText('Item').click({ button: 'right' });

// Shift + click
await page.getByText('Item').click({ modifiers: ['Shift'] });

// Ctrl + click on Windows and Linux
// Meta + click on macOS
await page.getByText('Item').click({ modifiers: ['ControlOrMeta'] });

// Hover over element
await page.getByText('Item').hover();

// Click the top left corner
await page.getByText('Item').click({ position: { x: 0, y: 0 } });
Under the hood, this and other pointer-related methods:
wait for element with given selector to be in DOM
wait for it to become displayed, i.e. not empty, no display:none, no visibility:hidden
wait for it to stop moving, for example, until css transition finishes
scroll the element into view
wait for it to receive pointer events at the action point, for example, waits until element becomes non-obscured by other elements
retry if the element is detached during any of the above checks
Forcing the click
Sometimes, apps use non-trivial logic where hovering the element overlays it with another element that intercepts the click. This behavior is indistinguishable from a bug where element gets covered and the click is dispatched elsewhere. If you know this is taking place, you can bypass the actionability checks and force the click:
await page.getByRole('button').click({ force: true });
Programmatic click
If you are not interested in testing your app under the real conditions and want to simulate the click by any means possible, you can trigger the HTMLElement.click() behavior via simply dispatching a click event on the element with locator.dispatchEvent():
await page.getByRole('button').dispatchEvent('click');
Type characters
CAUTION
Most of the time, you should input text with locator.fill(). See the Text input section above. You only need to type characters if there is special keyboard handling on the page.
Type into the field character by character, as if it was a user with a real keyboard with locator.pressSequentially().
// Press keys one by one
await page.locator('#area').pressSequentially('Hello World!');
This method will emit all the necessary keyboard events, with all the keydown, keyup, keypress events in place. You can even specify the optional delay between the key presses to simulate real user behavior.
Keys and shortcuts
// Hit Enter
await page.getByText('Submit').press('Enter');

// Dispatch Control+Right
await page.getByRole('textbox').press('Control+ArrowRight');

// Press $ sign on keyboard
await page.getByRole('textbox').press('$');
The locator.press() method focuses the selected element and produces a single keystroke. It accepts the logical key names that are emitted in the keyboardEvent.key property of the keyboard events:
Backquote, Minus, Equal, Backslash, Backspace, Tab, Delete, Escape,
ArrowDown, End, Enter, Home, Insert, PageDown, PageUp, ArrowRight,
ArrowUp, F1 - F12, Digit0 - Digit9, KeyA - KeyZ, etc.
You can alternatively specify a single character you'd like to produce such as "a" or "#".
Following modification shortcuts are also supported: Shift, Control, Alt, Meta.
Simple version produces a single character. This character is case-sensitive, so "a" and "A" will produce different results.
// <input id=name>
await page.locator('#name').press('Shift+A');

// <input id=name>
await page.locator('#name').press('Shift+ArrowLeft');
Shortcuts such as "Control+o" or "Control+Shift+T" are supported as well. When specified with the modifier, modifier is pressed and being held while the subsequent key is being pressed.
Note that you still need to specify the capital A in Shift-A to produce the capital character. Shift-a produces a lower-case one as if you had the CapsLock toggled.
Upload files
You can select input files for upload using the locator.setInputFiles() method. It expects first argument to point to an input element with the type "file". Multiple files can be passed in the array. If some of the file paths are relative, they are resolved relative to the current working directory. Empty array clears the selected files.
// Select one file
await page.getByLabel('Upload file').setInputFiles(path.join(__dirname, 'myfile.pdf'));

// Select multiple files
await page.getByLabel('Upload files').setInputFiles([
 path.join(__dirname, 'file1.txt'),
 path.join(__dirname, 'file2.txt'),
]);

// Select a directory
await page.getByLabel('Upload directory').setInputFiles(path.join(__dirname, 'mydir'));

// Remove all the selected files
await page.getByLabel('Upload file').setInputFiles([]);

// Upload buffer from memory
await page.getByLabel('Upload file').setInputFiles({
 name: 'file.txt',
 mimeType: 'text/plain',
 buffer: Buffer.from('this is test')
});
If you don't have input element in hand (it is created dynamically), you can handle the page.on('filechooser') event or use a corresponding waiting method upon your action:
// Start waiting for file chooser before clicking. Note no await.
const fileChooserPromise = page.waitForEvent('filechooser');
await page.getByLabel('Upload file').click();
const fileChooser = await fileChooserPromise;
await fileChooser.setFiles(path.join(__dirname, 'myfile.pdf'));
Focus element
For the dynamic pages that handle focus events, you can focus the given element with locator.focus().
await page.getByLabel('Password').focus();
Drag and Drop
You can perform drag&drop operation with locator.dragTo(). This method will:
Hover the element that will be dragged.
Press left mouse button.
Move mouse to the element that will receive the drop.
Release left mouse button.
await page.locator('#item-to-be-dragged').dragTo(page.locator('#item-to-drop-at'));
Dragging manually
If you want precise control over the drag operation, use lower-level methods like locator.hover(), mouse.down(), mouse.move() and mouse.up().
await page.locator('#item-to-be-dragged').hover();
await page.mouse.down();
await page.locator('#item-to-drop-at').hover();
await page.mouse.up();
NOTE
If your page relies on the dragover event being dispatched, you need at least two mouse moves to trigger it in all browsers. To reliably issue the second mouse move, repeat your mouse.move() or locator.hover() twice. The sequence of operations would be: hover the drag element, mouse down, hover the drop element, hover the drop element second time, mouse up.
Scrolling
Most of the time, Playwright will automatically scroll for you before doing any actions. Therefore, you do not need to scroll explicitly.
// Scrolls automatically so that button is visible
await page.getByRole('button').click();
However, in rare cases you might need to manually scroll. For example, you might want to force an "infinite list" to load more elements, or position the page for a specific screenshot. In such a case, the most reliable way is to find an element that you want to make visible at the bottom, and scroll it into view.
// Scroll the footer into view, forcing an "infinite list" to load more content
await page.getByText('Footer text').scrollIntoViewIfNeeded();
If you would like to control the scrolling more precisely, use mouse.wheel() or locator.evaluate():
// Position the mouse and scroll with the mouse wheel
await page.getByTestId('scrolling-container').hover();
await page.mouse.wheel(0, 10);

// Alternatively, programmatically scroll a specific element
await page.getByTestId('scrolling-container').evaluate(e => e.scrollTop += 100);

Assertions
Introduction
Playwright includes test assertions in the form of expect function. To make an assertion, call expect(value) and choose a matcher that reflects the expectation. There are many generic matchers like toEqual, toContain, toBeTruthy that can be used to assert any conditions.
expect(success).toBeTruthy();
Playwright also includes web-specific async matchers that will wait until the expected condition is met. Consider the following example:
await expect(page.getByTestId('status')).toHaveText('Submitted');
Playwright will be re-testing the element with the test id of status until the fetched element has the "Submitted" text. It will re-fetch the element and check it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is reached. You can either pass this timeout or configure it once via the testConfig.expect value in the test config.
By default, the timeout for assertions is set to 5 seconds. Learn more about various timeouts.
Auto-retrying assertions
The following assertions will retry until the assertion passes, or the assertion timeout is reached. Note that retrying assertions are async, so you must await them.
Assertion
Description
await expect(locator).toBeAttached()
Element is attached
await expect(locator).toBeChecked()
Checkbox is checked
await expect(locator).toBeDisabled()
Element is disabled
await expect(locator).toBeEditable()
Element is editable

await expect(page).toHaveTitle()
Page has a title
await expect(page).toHaveURL()

Non-retrying assertions
These assertions allow to test any conditions, but do not auto-retry. Most of the time, web pages show information asynchronously, and using non-retrying assertions can lead to a flaky test.
Prefer auto-retrying assertions whenever possible. For more complex assertions that need to be retried, use expect.poll or expect.toPass.
Assertion
Description
expect(value).toBe()
Value is the same
expect(value).toBeCloseTo()
Number is approximately equal
expect(value).toBeDefined()
Value is not undefined
expect(value).toBeFalsy()
Value is falsy, e.g. false, 0, null, etc.
expect(value).toBeGreaterThan()
Number is more than
expect(value).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual()
Number is more than or equal
expect(value).toBeInstanceOf()
Object is an instance of a class
expect(value).toBeLessThan()
Number is less than
expect(value).toBeLessThanOrEqual()

Negating matchers
In general, we can expect the opposite to be true by adding a .not to the front of the matchers:
expect(value).not.toEqual(0);
await expect(locator).not.toContainText('some text');
Soft assertions
By default, failed assertion will terminate test execution. Playwright also supports soft assertions: failed soft assertions do not terminate test execution, but mark the test as failed.
// Make a few checks that will not stop the test when failed...
await expect.soft(page.getByTestId('status')).toHaveText('Success');
await expect.soft(page.getByTestId('eta')).toHaveText('1 day');

// ... and continue the test to check more things.
await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'next page' }).click();
await expect.soft(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Make another order' })).toBeVisible();
At any point during test execution, you can check whether there were any soft assertion failures:
// Make a few checks that will not stop the test when failed...
await expect.soft(page.getByTestId('status')).toHaveText('Success');
await expect.soft(page.getByTestId('eta')).toHaveText('1 day');

// Avoid running further if there were soft assertion failures.
expect(test.info().errors).toHaveLength(0);
Note that soft assertions only work with Playwright test runner.
Custom expect message
You can specify a custom expect message as a second argument to the expect function, for example:
await expect(page.getByText('Name'), 'should be logged in').toBeVisible();
This message will be shown in reporters, both for passing and failing expects, providing more context about the assertion.
When expect passes, you might see a successful step like this:
â should be logged in    @example.spec.ts:18
When expect fails, the error would look like this:
   Error: should be logged in

   Call log:
     - expect.toBeVisible with timeout 5000ms
     - waiting for "getByText('Name')"


     2 |
     3 | test('example test', async({ page }) => {
   > 4 |   await expect(page.getByText('Name'), 'should be logged in').toBeVisible();
       |                                                                  ^
     5 | });
     6 |
Soft assertions also support custom message:
expect.soft(value, 'my soft assertion').toBe(56);
expect.configure
You can create your own pre-configured expect instance to have its own defaults such as timeout and soft.
const slowExpect = expect.configure({ timeout: 10000 });
await slowExpect(locator).toHaveText('Submit');

// Always do soft assertions.
const softExpect = expect.configure({ soft: true });
await softExpect(locator).toHaveText('Submit');
expect.poll
You can convert any synchronous expect to an asynchronous polling one using expect.poll.
The following method will poll given function until it returns HTTP status 200:
await expect.poll(async () => {
 const response = await page.request.get('https://api.example.com');
 return response.status();
}, {
 // Custom expect message for reporting, optional.
 message: 'make sure API eventually succeeds',
 // Poll for 10 seconds; defaults to 5 seconds. Pass 0 to disable timeout.
 timeout: 10000,
}).toBe(200);
You can also specify custom polling intervals:
await expect.poll(async () => {
 const response = await page.request.get('https://api.example.com');
 return response.status();
}, {
 // Probe, wait 1s, probe, wait 2s, probe, wait 10s, probe, wait 10s, probe
 // ... Defaults to [100, 250, 500, 1000].
 intervals: [1_000, 2_000, 10_000],
 timeout: 60_000
}).toBe(200);
You can combine expect.configure({ soft: true }) with expect.poll to perform soft assertions in polling logic.
const softExpect = expect.configure({ soft: true });
await softExpect.poll(async () => {
 const response = await page.request.get('https://api.example.com');
 return response.status();
}, {}).toBe(200);
This allows the test to continue even if the assertion inside poll fails.
expect.toPass
You can retry blocks of code until they are passing successfully.
await expect(async () => {
 const response = await page.request.get('https://api.example.com');
 expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
}).toPass();
You can also specify custom timeout and retry intervals:
await expect(async () => {
 const response = await page.request.get('https://api.example.com');
 expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
}).toPass({
 // Probe, wait 1s, probe, wait 2s, probe, wait 10s, probe, wait 10s, probe
 // ... Defaults to [100, 250, 500, 1000].
 intervals: [1_000, 2_000, 10_000],
 timeout: 60_000
});
Note that by default toPass has timeout 0 and does not respect custom expect timeout.
Add custom matchers using expect.extend
You can extend Playwright assertions by providing custom matchers. These matchers will be available on the expect object.
In this example we add a custom toHaveAmount function. Custom matcher should return a pass flag indicating whether the assertion passed, and a message callback that's used when the assertion fails.
fixtures.ts
import { expect as baseExpect } from '@playwright/test';
import type { Locator } from '@playwright/test';

export { test } from '@playwright/test';

export const expect = baseExpect.extend({
 async toHaveAmount(locator: Locator, expected: number, options?: { timeout?: number }) {
   const assertionName = 'toHaveAmount';
   let pass: boolean;
   let matcherResult: any;
   try {
     const expectation = this.isNot ? baseExpect(locator).not : baseExpect(locator);
     await expectation.toHaveAttribute('data-amount', String(expected), options);
     pass = true;
   } catch (e: any) {
     matcherResult = e.matcherResult;
     pass = false;
   }

   if (this.isNot) {
     pass =!pass;
   }

   const message = pass
     ? () => this.utils.matcherHint(assertionName, undefined, undefined, { isNot: this.isNot }) +
         '\n\n' +
         `Locator: ${locator}\n` +
         `Expected: not ${this.utils.printExpected(expected)}\n` +
         (matcherResult ? `Received: ${this.utils.printReceived(matcherResult.actual)}` : '')
     : () =>  this.utils.matcherHint(assertionName, undefined, undefined, { isNot: this.isNot }) +
         '\n\n' +
         `Locator: ${locator}\n` +
         `Expected: ${this.utils.printExpected(expected)}\n` +
         (matcherResult ? `Received: ${this.utils.printReceived(matcherResult.actual)}` : '');

   return {
     message,
     pass,
     name: assertionName,
     expected,
     actual: matcherResult?.actual,
   };
 },
});
Now we can use toHaveAmount in the test.
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from './fixtures';

test('amount', async () => {
 await expect(page.locator('.cart')).toHaveAmount(4);
});
Compatibility with expect library
NOTE
Do not confuse Playwright's expect with the expect library. The latter is not fully integrated with Playwright test runner, so make sure to use Playwright's own expect.
Combine custom matchers from multiple modules
You can combine custom matchers from multiple files or modules.
fixtures.ts
import { mergeTests, mergeExpects } from '@playwright/test';
import { test as dbTest, expect as dbExpect } from 'database-test-utils';
import { test as a11yTest, expect as a11yExpect } from 'a11y-test-utils';

export const expect = mergeExpects(dbExpect, a11yExpect);
export const test = mergeTests(dbTest, a11yTest);
test.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from './fixtures';

test('passes', async ({ database }) => {
 await expect(database).toHaveDatabaseUser('admin');
});

API testing
Introduction
Playwright can be used to get access to the REST API of your application.
Sometimes you may want to send requests to the server directly from Node.js without loading a page and running js code in it. A few examples where it may come in handy:
Test your server API.
Prepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test.
Validate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser.
All of that could be achieved via APIRequestContext methods.
Writing API Test
APIRequestContext can send all kinds of HTTP(S) requests over network.
The following example demonstrates how to use Playwright to test issues creation via GitHub API. The test suite will do the following:
Create a new repository before running tests.
Create a few issues and validate server state.
Delete the repository after running tests.
Configuration
GitHub API requires authorization, so we'll configure the token once for all tests. While at it, we'll also set the baseURL to simplify the tests. You can either put them in the configuration file, or in the test file with test.use().
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   // All requests we send go to this API endpoint.
   baseURL: 'https://api.github.com',
   extraHTTPHeaders: {
     // We set this header per GitHub guidelines.
     'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json',
     // Add authorization token to all requests.
     // Assuming personal access token available in the environment.
     'Authorization': `token ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
   },
 }
});
Proxy configuration
If your tests need to run behind a proxy, you can specify this in the config and the request fixture will pick it up automatically:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   proxy: {
     server: 'http://my-proxy:8080',
     username: 'user',
     password: 'secret'
   },
 }
});
Writing tests
Playwright Test comes with the built-in request fixture that respects configuration options like baseURL or extraHTTPHeaders we specified and is ready to send some requests.
Now we can add a few tests that will create new issues in the repository.
const REPO = 'test-repo-1';
const USER = 'github-username';

test('should create a bug report', async ({ request }) => {
 const newIssue = await request.post(`/repos/${USER}/${REPO}/issues`, {
   data: {
     title: '[Bug] report 1',
     body: 'Bug description',
   }
 });
 expect(newIssue.ok()).toBeTruthy();

 const issues = await request.get(`/repos/${USER}/${REPO}/issues`);
 expect(issues.ok()).toBeTruthy();
 expect(await issues.json()).toContainEqual(expect.objectContaining({
   title: '[Bug] report 1',
   body: 'Bug description'
 }));
});

test('should create a feature request', async ({ request }) => {
 const newIssue = await request.post(`/repos/${USER}/${REPO}/issues`, {
   data: {
     title: '[Feature] request 1',
     body: 'Feature description',
   }
 });
 expect(newIssue.ok()).toBeTruthy();

 const issues = await request.get(`/repos/${USER}/${REPO}/issues`);
 expect(issues.ok()).toBeTruthy();
 expect(await issues.json()).toContainEqual(expect.objectContaining({
   title: '[Feature] request 1',
   body: 'Feature description'
 }));
});
Setup and teardown
These tests assume that repository exists. You probably want to create a new one before running tests and delete it afterwards. Use beforeAll and afterAll hooks for that.
test.beforeAll(async ({ request }) => {
 // Create a new repository
 const response = await request.post('/user/repos', {
   data: {
     name: REPO
   }
 });
 expect(response.ok()).toBeTruthy();
});

test.afterAll(async ({ request }) => {
 // Delete the repository
 const response = await request.delete(`/repos/${USER}/${REPO}`);
 expect(response.ok()).toBeTruthy();
});
Using request context
Behind the scenes, request fixture will actually call apiRequest.newContext(). You can always do that manually if you'd like more control. Below is a standalone script that does the same as beforeAll and afterAll from above.
import { request } from '@playwright/test';
const REPO = 'test-repo-1';
const USER = 'github-username';

(async () => {
 // Create a context that will issue http requests.
 const context = await request.newContext({
   baseURL: 'https://api.github.com',
 });

 // Create a repository.
 await context.post('/user/repos', {
   headers: {
     'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json',
     // Add GitHub personal access token.
     'Authorization': `token ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
   },
   data: {
     name: REPO
   }
 });

 // Delete a repository.
 await context.delete(`/repos/${USER}/${REPO}`, {
   headers: {
     'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json',
     // Add GitHub personal access token.
     'Authorization': `token ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
   }
 });
})();
Sending API requests from UI tests
While running tests inside browsers you may want to make calls to the HTTP API of your application. It may be helpful if you need to prepare server state before running a test or to check some postconditions on the server after performing some actions in the browser. All of that could be achieved via APIRequestContext methods.
Establishing preconditions
The following test creates a new issue via API and then navigates to the list of all issues in the project to check that it appears at the top of the list.
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

const REPO = 'test-repo-1';
const USER = 'github-username';

// Request context is reused by all tests in the file.
let apiContext;

test.beforeAll(async ({ playwright }) => {
 apiContext = await playwright.request.newContext({
   // All requests we send go to this API endpoint.
   baseURL: 'https://api.github.com',
   extraHTTPHeaders: {
     // We set this header per GitHub guidelines.
     'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json',
     // Add authorization token to all requests.
     // Assuming personal access token available in the environment.
     'Authorization': `token ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
   },
 });
});

test.afterAll(async ({ }) => {
 // Dispose all responses.
 await apiContext.dispose();
});

test('last created issue should be first in the list', async ({ page }) => {
 const newIssue = await apiContext.post(`/repos/${USER}/${REPO}/issues`, {
   data: {
     title: '[Feature] request 1',
   }
 });
 expect(newIssue.ok()).toBeTruthy();

 await page.goto(`https://github.com/${USER}/${REPO}/issues`);
 const firstIssue = page.locator(`a[data-hovercard-type='issue']`).first();
 await expect(firstIssue).toHaveText('[Feature] request 1');
});
Validating postconditions
The following test creates a new issue via user interface in the browser and then uses checks if it was created via API:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

const REPO = 'test-repo-1';
const USER = 'github-username';

// Request context is reused by all tests in the file.
let apiContext;

test.beforeAll(async ({ playwright }) => {
 apiContext = await playwright.request.newContext({
   // All requests we send go to this API endpoint.
   baseURL: 'https://api.github.com',
   extraHTTPHeaders: {
     // We set this header per GitHub guidelines.
     'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json',
     // Add authorization token to all requests.
     // Assuming personal access token available in the environment.
     'Authorization': `token ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
   },
 });
});

test.afterAll(async ({ }) => {
 // Dispose all responses.
 await apiContext.dispose();
});

test('last created issue should be on the server', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto(`https://github.com/${USER}/${REPO}/issues`);
 await page.getByText('New Issue').click();
 await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Title' }).fill('Bug report 1');
 await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Comment body' }).fill('Bug description');
 await page.getByText('Submit new issue').click();
 const issueId = new URL(page.url()).pathname.split('/').pop();

 const newIssue = await apiContext.get(
     `https://api.github.com/repos/${USER}/${REPO}/issues/${issueId}`
 );
 expect(newIssue.ok()).toBeTruthy();
 expect(newIssue.json()).toEqual(expect.objectContaining({
   title: 'Bug report 1'
 }));
});
Reusing authentication state
Web apps use cookie-based or token-based authentication, where authenticated state is stored as cookies. Playwright provides apiRequestContext.storageState() method that can be used to retrieve storage state from an authenticated context and then create new contexts with that state.
Storage state is interchangeable between BrowserContext and APIRequestContext. You can use it to log in via API calls and then create a new context with cookies already there. The following code snippet retrieves state from an authenticated APIRequestContext and creates a new BrowserContext with that state.
const requestContext = await request.newContext({
 httpCredentials: {
   username: 'user',
   password: 'passwd'
 }
});
await requestContext.get(`https://api.example.com/login`);
// Save storage state into the file.
await requestContext.storageState({ path: 'state.json' });

// Create a new context with the saved storage state.
const context = await browser.newContext({ storageState: 'state.json' });
Context request vs global request
There are two types of APIRequestContext:
associated with a BrowserContext
isolated instance, created via apiRequest.newContext()
The main difference is that APIRequestContext accessible via browserContext.request and page.request will populate request's Cookie header from the browser context and will automatically update browser cookies if APIResponse has Set-Cookie header:
test('context request will share cookie storage with its browser context', async ({
 page,
 context,
}) => {
 await context.route('https://www.github.com/', async route => {
   // Send an API request that shares cookie storage with the browser context.
   const response = await context.request.fetch(route.request());
   const responseHeaders = response.headers();

   // The response will have 'Set-Cookie' header.
   const responseCookies = new Map(responseHeaders['set-cookie']
       .split('\n')
       .map(c => c.split(';', 2)[0].split('=')));
   // The response will have 3 cookies in 'Set-Cookie' header.
   expect(responseCookies.size).toBe(3);
   const contextCookies = await context.cookies();
   // The browser context will already contain all the cookies from the API response.
   expect(new Map(contextCookies.map(({ name, value }) =>
     [name, value])
   )).toEqual(responseCookies);

   await route.fulfill({
     response,
     headers: { ...responseHeaders, foo: 'bar' },
   });
 });
 await page.goto('https://www.github.com/');
});
If you don't want APIRequestContext to use and update cookies from the browser context, you can manually create a new instance of APIRequestContext which will have its own isolated cookies:
test('global context request has isolated cookie storage', async ({
 page,
 context,
 browser,
 playwright
}) => {
 // Create a new instance of APIRequestContext with isolated cookie storage.
 const request = await playwright.request.newContext();
 await context.route('https://www.github.com/', async route => {
   const response = await request.fetch(route.request());
   const responseHeaders = response.headers();

   const responseCookies = new Map(responseHeaders['set-cookie']
       .split('\n')
       .map(c => c.split(';', 2)[0].split('=')));
   // The response will have 3 cookies in 'Set-Cookie' header.
   expect(responseCookies.size).toBe(3);
   const contextCookies = await context.cookies();
   // The browser context will not have any cookies from the isolated API request.
   expect(contextCookies.length).toBe(0);

   // Manually export cookie storage.
   const storageState = await request.storageState();
   // Create a new context and initialize it with the cookies from the global request.
   const browserContext2 = await browser.newContext({ storageState });
   const contextCookies2 = await browserContext2.cookies();
   // The new browser context will already contain all the cookies from the API response.
   expect(
       new Map(contextCookies2.map(({ name, value }) => [name, value]))
   ).toEqual(responseCookies);

   await route.fulfill({
     response,
     headers: { ...responseHeaders, foo: 'bar' },
   });
 });
 await page.goto('https://www.github.com/');
 await request.dispose();
});

Authentication
Introduction
Playwright executes tests in isolated environments called browser contexts. This isolation model improves reproducibility and prevents cascading test failures. Tests can load existing authenticated state. This eliminates the need to authenticate in every test and speeds up test execution.
Core concepts
Regardless of the authentication strategy you choose, you are likely to store authenticated browser state on the file system.
We recommend to create playwright/.auth directory and add it to your .gitignore. Your authentication routine will produce authenticated browser state and save it to a file in this playwright/.auth directory. Later on, tests will reuse this state and start already authenticated.
DANGER
The browser state file may contain sensitive cookies and headers that could be used to impersonate you or your test account. We strongly discourage checking them into private or public repositories.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
mkdir -p playwright/.auth
echo $'\nplaywright/.auth' >> .gitignore
Basic: shared account in all tests
This is the recommended approach for tests without server-side state. Authenticate once in the setup project, save the authentication state, and then reuse it to bootstrap each test already authenticated.
When to use
When you can imagine all your tests running at the same time with the same account, without affecting each other.
When not to use
Your tests modify server-side state. For example, one test checks the rendering of the settings page, while the other test is changing the setting, and you run tests in parallel. In this case, tests must use different accounts.
Your authentication is browser-specific.
Details
Create tests/auth.setup.ts that will prepare authenticated browser state for all other tests.
tests/auth.setup.ts
import { test as setup, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import path from 'path';

const authFile = path.join(__dirname, '../playwright/.auth/user.json');

setup('authenticate', async ({ page }) => {
 // Perform authentication steps. Replace these actions with your own.
 await page.goto('https://github.com/login');
 await page.getByLabel('Username or email address').fill('username');
 await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('password');
 await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();
 // Wait until the page receives the cookies.
 //
 // Sometimes login flow sets cookies in the process of several redirects.
 // Wait for the final URL to ensure that the cookies are actually set.
 await page.waitForURL('https://github.com/');
 // Alternatively, you can wait until the page reaches a state where all cookies are set.
 await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'View profile and more' })).toBeVisible();

 // End of authentication steps.

 await page.context().storageState({ path: authFile });
});
Create a new setup project in the config and declare it as a dependency for all your testing projects. This project will always run and authenticate before all the tests. All testing projects should use the authenticated state as storageState.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   // Setup project
   { name: 'setup', testMatch: /.*\.setup\.ts/ },

   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: {
       ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
       // Use prepared auth state.
       storageState: 'playwright/.auth/user.json',
     },
     dependencies: ['setup'],
   },

   {
     name: 'firefox',
     use: {
       ...devices['Desktop Firefox'],
       // Use prepared auth state.
       storageState: 'playwright/.auth/user.json',
     },
     dependencies: ['setup'],
   },
 ],
});
Tests start already authenticated because we specified storageState in the config.
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
 // page is authenticated
});
Note that you need to delete the stored state when it expires. If you don't need to keep the state between test runs, write the browser state under testProject.outputDir, which is automatically cleaned up before every test run.
Authenticating in UI mode
UI mode will not run the setup project by default to improve testing speed. We recommend to authenticate by manually running the auth.setup.ts from time to time, whenever existing authentication expires.
First enable the setup project in the filters, then click the triangle button next to auth.setup.ts file, and then disable the setup project in the filters again.
Moderate: one account per parallel worker
This is the recommended approach for tests that modify server-side state. In Playwright, worker processes run in parallel. In this approach, each parallel worker is authenticated once. All tests ran by worker are reusing the same authentication state. We will need multiple testing accounts, one per each parallel worker.
When to use
Your tests modify shared server-side state. For example, one test checks the rendering of the settings page, while the other test is changing the setting.
When not to use
Your tests do not modify any shared server-side state. In this case, all tests can use a single shared account.
Details
We will authenticate once per worker process, each with a unique account.
Create playwright/fixtures.ts file that will override storageState fixture to authenticate once per worker. Use testInfo.parallelIndex to differentiate between workers.
playwright/fixtures.ts
import { test as baseTest, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

export * from '@playwright/test';
export const test = baseTest.extend<{}, { workerStorageState: string }>({
 // Use the same storage state for all tests in this worker.
 storageState: ({ workerStorageState }, use) => use(workerStorageState),

 // Authenticate once per worker with a worker-scoped fixture.
 workerStorageState: [async ({ browser }, use) => {
   // Use parallelIndex as a unique identifier for each worker.
   const id = test.info().parallelIndex;
   const fileName = path.resolve(test.info().project.outputDir, `.auth/${id}.json`);

   if (fs.existsSync(fileName)) {
     // Reuse existing authentication state if any.
     await use(fileName);
     return;
   }

   // Important: make sure we authenticate in a clean environment by unsetting storage state.
   const page = await browser.newPage({ storageState: undefined });

   // Acquire a unique account, for example create a new one.
   // Alternatively, you can have a list of precreated accounts for testing.
   // Make sure that accounts are unique, so that multiple team members
   // can run tests at the same time without interference.
   const account = await acquireAccount(id);

   // Perform authentication steps. Replace these actions with your own.
   await page.goto('https://github.com/login');
   await page.getByLabel('Username or email address').fill(account.username);
   await page.getByLabel('Password').fill(account.password);
   await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();
   // Wait until the page receives the cookies.
   //
   // Sometimes login flow sets cookies in the process of several redirects.
   // Wait for the final URL to ensure that the cookies are actually set.
   await page.waitForURL('https://github.com/');
   // Alternatively, you can wait until the page reaches a state where all cookies are set.
   await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'View profile and more' })).toBeVisible();

   // End of authentication steps.

   await page.context().storageState({ path: fileName });
   await page.close();
   await use(fileName);
 }, { scope: 'worker' }],
});
Now, each test file should import test from our fixtures file instead of @playwright/test. No changes are needed in the config.
tests/example.spec.ts
// Important: import our fixtures.
import { test, expect } from '../playwright/fixtures';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
 // page is authenticated
});
Advanced scenarios
Authenticate with API request
When to use
Your web application supports authenticating via API that is easier/faster than interacting with the app UI.
Details
We will send the API request with APIRequestContext and then save authenticated state as usual.
In the setup project:
tests/auth.setup.ts
import { test as setup } from '@playwright/test';

const authFile = 'playwright/.auth/user.json';

setup('authenticate', async ({ request }) => {
 // Send authentication request. Replace with your own.
 await request.post('https://github.com/login', {
   form: {
     'user': 'user',
     'password': 'password'
   }
 });
 await request.storageState({ path: authFile });
});
Alternatively, in a worker fixture:
playwright/fixtures.ts
import { test as baseTest, request } from '@playwright/test';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

export * from '@playwright/test';
export const test = baseTest.extend<{}, { workerStorageState: string }>({
 // Use the same storage state for all tests in this worker.
 storageState: ({ workerStorageState }, use) => use(workerStorageState),

 // Authenticate once per worker with a worker-scoped fixture.
 workerStorageState: [async ({}, use) => {
   // Use parallelIndex as a unique identifier for each worker.
   const id = test.info().parallelIndex;
   const fileName = path.resolve(test.info().project.outputDir, `.auth/${id}.json`);

   if (fs.existsSync(fileName)) {
     // Reuse existing authentication state if any.
     await use(fileName);
     return;
   }

   // Important: make sure we authenticate in a clean environment by unsetting storage state.
   const context = await request.newContext({ storageState: undefined });

   // Acquire a unique account, for example create a new one.
   // Alternatively, you can have a list of precreated accounts for testing.
   // Make sure that accounts are unique, so that multiple team members
   // can run tests at the same time without interference.
   const account = await acquireAccount(id);

   // Send authentication request. Replace with your own.
   await context.post('https://github.com/login', {
     form: {
       'user': 'user',
       'password': 'password'
     }
   });

   await context.storageState({ path: fileName });
   await context.dispose();
   await use(fileName);
 }, { scope: 'worker' }],
});
Multiple signed in roles
When to use
You have more than one role in your end to end tests, but you can reuse accounts across all tests.
Details
We will authenticate multiple times in the setup project.
tests/auth.setup.ts
import { test as setup, expect } from '@playwright/test';

const adminFile = 'playwright/.auth/admin.json';

setup('authenticate as admin', async ({ page }) => {
 // Perform authentication steps. Replace these actions with your own.
 await page.goto('https://github.com/login');
 await page.getByLabel('Username or email address').fill('admin');
 await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('password');
 await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();
 // Wait until the page receives the cookies.
 //
 // Sometimes login flow sets cookies in the process of several redirects.
 // Wait for the final URL to ensure that the cookies are actually set.
 await page.waitForURL('https://github.com/');
 // Alternatively, you can wait until the page reaches a state where all cookies are set.
 await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'View profile and more' })).toBeVisible();

 // End of authentication steps.

 await page.context().storageState({ path: adminFile });
});

const userFile = 'playwright/.auth/user.json';

setup('authenticate as user', async ({ page }) => {
 // Perform authentication steps. Replace these actions with your own.
 await page.goto('https://github.com/login');
 await page.getByLabel('Username or email address').fill('user');
 await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('password');
 await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();
 // Wait until the page receives the cookies.
 //
 // Sometimes login flow sets cookies in the process of several redirects.
 // Wait for the final URL to ensure that the cookies are actually set.
 await page.waitForURL('https://github.com/');
 // Alternatively, you can wait until the page reaches a state where all cookies are set.
 await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'View profile and more' })).toBeVisible();

 // End of authentication steps.

 await page.context().storageState({ path: userFile });
});
After that, specify storageState for each test file or test group, instead of setting it in the config.
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({ storageState: 'playwright/.auth/admin.json' });

test('admin test', async ({ page }) => {
 // page is authenticated as admin
});

test.describe(() => {
 test.use({ storageState: 'playwright/.auth/user.json' });

 test('user test', async ({ page }) => {
   // page is authenticated as a user
 });
});

Testing multiple roles together
When to use
You need to test how multiple authenticated roles interact together, in a single test.
Details
Use multiple BrowserContexts and Pages with different storage states in the same test.
tests/example.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('admin and user', async ({ browser }) => {
 // adminContext and all pages inside, including adminPage, are signed in as "admin".
 const adminContext = await browser.newContext({ storageState: 'playwright/.auth/admin.json' });
 const adminPage = await adminContext.newPage();

 // userContext and all pages inside, including userPage, are signed in as "user".
 const userContext = await browser.newContext({ storageState: 'playwright/.auth/user.json' });
 const userPage = await userContext.newPage();

 // ... interact with both adminPage and userPage ...

 await adminContext.close();
 await userContext.close();
});
Testing multiple roles with POM fixtures
When to use
You need to test how multiple authenticated roles interact together, in a single test.
Details
You can introduce fixtures that will provide a page authenticated as each role.
Below is an example that creates fixtures for two Page Object Models - admin POM and user POM. It assumes adminStorageState.json and userStorageState.json files were created in the global setup.
playwright/fixtures.ts
import { test as base, type Page, type Locator } from '@playwright/test';

// Page Object Model for the "admin" page.
// Here you can add locators and helper methods specific to the admin page.
class AdminPage {
 // Page signed in as "admin".
 page: Page;

 // Example locator pointing to "Welcome, Admin" greeting.
 greeting: Locator;

 constructor(page: Page) {
   this.page = page;
   this.greeting = page.locator('#greeting');
 }
}

// Page Object Model for the "user" page.
// Here you can add locators and helper methods specific to the user page.
class UserPage {
 // Page signed in as "user".
 page: Page;

 // Example locator pointing to "Welcome, User" greeting.
 greeting: Locator;

 constructor(page: Page) {
   this.page = page;
   this.greeting = page.locator('#greeting');
 }
}

// Declare the types of your fixtures.
type MyFixtures = {
 adminPage: AdminPage;
 userPage: UserPage;
};

export * from '@playwright/test';
export const test = base.extend<MyFixtures>({
 adminPage: async ({ browser }, use) => {
   const context = await browser.newContext({ storageState: 'playwright/.auth/admin.json' });
   const adminPage = new AdminPage(await context.newPage());
   await use(adminPage);
   await context.close();
 },
 userPage: async ({ browser }, use) => {
   const context = await browser.newContext({ storageState: 'playwright/.auth/user.json' });
   const userPage = new UserPage(await context.newPage());
   await use(userPage);
   await context.close();
 },
});

tests/example.spec.ts
// Import test with our new fixtures.
import { test, expect } from '../playwright/fixtures';

// Use adminPage and userPage fixtures in the test.
test('admin and user', async ({ adminPage, userPage }) => {
 // ... interact with both adminPage and userPage ...
 await expect(adminPage.greeting).toHaveText('Welcome, Admin');
 await expect(userPage.greeting).toHaveText('Welcome, User');
});
Session storage
Reusing authenticated state covers cookies, local storage and IndexedDB based authentication. Rarely, session storage is used for storing information associated with the signed-in state. Session storage is specific to a particular domain and is not persisted across page loads. Playwright does not provide API to persist session storage, but the following snippet can be used to save/load session storage.
// Get session storage and store as env variable
const sessionStorage = await page.evaluate(() => JSON.stringify(sessionStorage));
fs.writeFileSync('playwright/.auth/session.json', sessionStorage, 'utf-8');

// Set session storage in a new context
const sessionStorage = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('playwright/.auth/session.json', 'utf-8'));
await context.addInitScript(storage => {
 if (window.location.hostname === 'example.com') {
   for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(storage))
     window.sessionStorage.setItem(key, value);
 }
}, sessionStorage);
Avoid authentication in some tests
You can reset storage state in a test file to avoid authentication that was set up for the whole project.
not-signed-in.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

// Reset storage state for this file to avoid being authenticated
test.use({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } });

test('not signed in test', async ({ page }) => {
 // ...
});

Auto-waiting
Introduction
Playwright performs a range of actionability checks on the elements before making actions to ensure these actions behave as expected. It auto-waits for all the relevant checks to pass and only then performs the requested action. If the required checks do not pass within the given timeout, action fails with the TimeoutError.
For example, for locator.click(), Playwright will ensure that:
locator resolves to exactly one element
element is Visible
element is Stable, as in not animating or completed animation
element Receives Events, as in not obscured by other elements
element is Enabled
Here is the complete list of actionability checks performed for each action:

Forcing actions
Some actions like locator.click() support force option that disables non-essential actionability checks, for example passing truthy force to locator.click() method will not check that the target element actually receives click events.
Assertions
Playwright includes auto-retrying assertions that remove flakiness by waiting until the condition is met, similarly to auto-waiting before actions.

expect(locator).toBeAttached()
Element is attached
expect(locator).toBeChecked()
Checkbox is checked
expect(locator).toBeDisabled()

Learn more in the assertions guide.
Visible
Element is considered visible when it has non-empty bounding box and does not have visibility:hidden computed style.
Note that according to this definition:
Elements of zero size are not considered visible.
Elements with display:none are not considered visible.
Elements with opacity:0 are considered visible.
Stable
Element is considered stable when it has maintained the same bounding box for at least two consecutive animation frames.
Enabled
Element is considered enabled when it is not disabled.
Element is disabled when:
it is a <button>, <select>, <input>, <textarea>, <option> or <optgroup> with a [disabled] attribute;
it is a <button>, <select>, <input>, <textarea>, <option> or <optgroup> that is a part of a <fieldset> with a [disabled] attribute;
it is a descendant of an element with [aria-disabled=true] attribute.
Editable
Element is considered editable when it is enabled and is not readonly.
Element is readonly when:
it is a <select>, <input> or <textarea> with a [readonly] attribute;
it has an [aria-readonly=true] attribute and an aria role that supports it.
Receives Events
Element is considered receiving pointer events when it is the hit target of the pointer event at the action point. For example, when clicking at the point (10;10), Playwright checks whether some other element (usually an overlay) will instead capture the click at (10;10).
For example, consider a scenario where Playwright will click Sign Up button regardless of when the locator.click() call was made:
page is checking that user name is unique and Sign Up button is disabled;
after checking with the server, the disabled Sign Up button is replaced with another one that is now enabled.

Best Practices
Introduction
This guide should help you to make sure you are following our best practices and writing tests that are more resilient.
Testing philosophy
Test user-visible behavior
Automated tests should verify that the application code works for the end users, and avoid relying on implementation details such as things which users will not typically use, see, or even know about such as the name of a function, whether something is an array, or the CSS class of some element. The end user will see or interact with what is rendered on the page, so your test should typically only see/interact with the same rendered output.
Make tests as isolated as possible
Each test should be completely isolated from another test and should run independently with its own local storage, session storage, data, cookies etc. Test isolation improves reproducibility, makes debugging easier and prevents cascading test failures.
In order to avoid repetition for a particular part of your test you can use before and after hooks. Within your test file add a before hook to run a part of your test before each test such as going to a particular URL or logging in to a part of your app. This keeps your tests isolated as no test relies on another. However it is also ok to have a little duplication when tests are simple enough especially if it keeps your tests clearer and easier to read and maintain.
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
 // Runs before each test and signs in each page.
 await page.goto('https://github.com/login');
 await page.getByLabel('Username or email address').fill('username');
 await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('password');
 await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();
});

test('first', async ({ page }) => {
 // page is signed in.
});

test('second', async ({ page }) => {
 // page is signed in.
});
You can also reuse the signed-in state in the tests with setup project. That way you can log in only once and then skip the log in step for all of the tests.
Avoid testing third-party dependencies
Only test what you control. Don't try to test links to external sites or third party servers that you do not control. Not only is it time consuming and can slow down your tests but also you cannot control the content of the page you are linking to, or if there are cookie banners or overlay pages or anything else that might cause your test to fail.
Instead, use the Playwright Network API and guarantee the response needed.
await page.route('**/api/fetch_data_third_party_dependency', route => route.fulfill({
 status: 200,
 body: testData,
}));
await page.goto('https://example.com');
Testing with a database
If working with a database then make sure you control the data. Test against a staging environment and make sure it doesn't change. For visual regression tests make sure the operating system and browser versions are the same.
Best Practices
Use locators
In order to write end to end tests we need to first find elements on the webpage. We can do this by using Playwright's built in locators. Locators come with auto waiting and retry-ability. Auto waiting means that Playwright performs a range of actionability checks on the elements, such as ensuring the element is visible and enabled before it performs the click. To make tests resilient, we recommend prioritizing user-facing attributes and explicit contracts.
// ð
page.getByRole('button', { name: 'submit' });
Use chaining and filtering
Locators can be chained to narrow down the search to a particular part of the page.
const product = page.getByRole('listitem').filter({ hasText: 'Product 2' });
You can also filter locators by text or by another locator.
await page
   .getByRole('listitem')
   .filter({ hasText: 'Product 2' })
   .getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' })
   .click();
Prefer user-facing attributes to XPath or CSS selectors
Your DOM can easily change so having your tests depend on your DOM structure can lead to failing tests. For example consider selecting this button by its CSS classes. Should the designer change something then the class might change, thus breaking your test.
// ð
page.locator('button.buttonIcon.episode-actions-later');
Use locators that are resilient to changes in the DOM.
// ð
page.getByRole('button', { name: 'submit' });
Generate locators
Playwright has a test generator that can generate tests and pick locators for you. It will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing role, text and test id locators. If the generator finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient and uniquely identify the target element, so you don't have to worry about failing tests due to locators.
Use codegen to generate locators
To pick a locator run the codegen command followed by the URL that you would like to pick a locator from.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright codegen playwright.dev
This will open a new browser window as well as the Playwright inspector. To pick a locator first click on the 'Record' button to stop the recording. By default when you run the codegen command it will start a new recording. Once you stop the recording the 'Pick Locator' button will be available to click.
You can then hover over any element on your page in the browser window and see the locator highlighted below your cursor. Clicking on an element will add the locator into the Playwright inspector. You can either copy the locator and paste into your test file or continue to explore the locator by editing it in the Playwright Inspector, for example by modifying the text, and seeing the results in the browser window.

Use the VS Code extension to generate locators
You can also use the VS Code Extension to generate locators as well as record a test. The VS Code extension also gives you a great developer experience when writing, running, and debugging tests.

Use web first assertions
Assertions are a way to verify that the expected result and the actual result matched or not. By using web first assertions Playwright will wait until the expected condition is met. For example, when testing an alert message, a test would click a button that makes a message appear and check that the alert message is there. If the alert message takes half a second to appear, assertions such as toBeVisible() will wait and retry if needed.
// ð
await expect(page.getByText('welcome')).toBeVisible();

// ð
expect(await page.getByText('welcome').isVisible()).toBe(true);
Don't use manual assertions
Don't use manual assertions that are not awaiting the expect. In the code below the await is inside the expect rather than before it. When using assertions such as isVisible() the test won't wait a single second, it will just check the locator is there and return immediately.
// ð
expect(await page.getByText('welcome').isVisible()).toBe(true);
Use web first assertions such as toBeVisible() instead.
// ð
await expect(page.getByText('welcome')).toBeVisible();
Configure debugging
Local debugging
For local debugging we recommend you debug your tests live in VSCode. by installing the VS Code extension. You can run tests in debug mode by right clicking on the line next to the test you want to run which will open a browser window and pause at where the breakpoint is set.

You can live debug your test by clicking or editing the locators in your test in VS Code which will highlight this locator in the browser window as well as show you any other matching locators found on the page.

You can also debug your tests with the Playwright inspector by running your tests with the --debug flag.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright test --debug
You can then step through your test, view actionability logs and edit the locator live and see it highlighted in the browser window. This will show you which locators match, how many of them there are.

To debug a specific test add the name of the test file and the line number of the test followed by the --debug flag.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright test example.spec.ts:9 --debug
Debugging on CI
For CI failures, use the Playwright trace viewer instead of videos and screenshots. The trace viewer gives you a full trace of your tests as a local Progressive Web App (PWA) that can easily be shared. With the trace viewer you can view the timeline, inspect DOM snapshots for each action using dev tools, view network requests and more.

Traces are configured in the Playwright config file and are set to run on CI on the first retry of a failed test. We don't recommend setting this to on so that traces are run on every test as it's very performance heavy. However you can run a trace locally when developing with the --trace flag.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright test --trace on
Once you run this command your traces will be recorded for each test and can be viewed directly from the HTML report.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright show-report

Traces can be opened by clicking on the icon next to the test file name or by opening each of the test reports and scrolling down to the traces section.

Use Playwright's Tooling
Playwright comes with a range of tooling to help you write tests.
The VS Code extension gives you a great developer experience when writing, running, and debugging tests.
The test generator can generate tests and pick locators for you.
The trace viewer gives you a full trace of your tests as a local PWA that can easily be shared. With the trace viewer you can view the timeline, inspect DOM snapshots for each action, view network requests and more.
The UI Mode lets you explore, run and debug tests with a time travel experience complete with watch mode. All test files are loaded into the testing sidebar where you can expand each file and describe block to individually run, view, watch and debug each test.
TypeScript in Playwright works out of the box and gives you better IDE integrations. Your IDE will show you everything you can do and highlight when you do something wrong. No TypeScript experience is needed and it is not necessary for your code to be in TypeScript, all you need to do is create your tests with a .ts extension.
Test across all browsers
Playwright makes it easy to test your site across all browsers no matter what platform you are on. Testing across all browsers ensures your app works for all users. In your config file you can set up projects adding the name and which browser or device to use.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
   },
   {
     name: 'firefox',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
   },
   {
     name: 'webkit',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
   },
 ],
});
Keep your Playwright dependency up to date
By keeping your Playwright version up to date you will be able to test your app on the latest browser versions and catch failures before the latest browser version is released to the public.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest
Check the release notes to see what the latest version is and what changes have been released.
You can see what version of Playwright you have by running the following command.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright --version
Run tests on CI
Setup CI/CD and run your tests frequently. The more often you run your tests the better. Ideally you should run your tests on each commit and pull request. Playwright comes with a GitHub actions workflow so that tests will run on CI for you with no setup required. Playwright can also be setup on the CI environment of your choice.
Use Linux when running your tests on CI as it is cheaper. Developers can use whatever environment when running locally but use linux on CI. Consider setting up Sharding to make CI faster.
Optimize browser downloads on CI
Only install the browsers that you actually need, especially on CI. For example, if you're only testing with Chromium, install just Chromium.
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
# Instead of installing all browsers
npx playwright install --with-deps

# Install only Chromium
npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
This saves both download time and disk space on your CI machines.
Lint your tests
We recommend TypeScript and linting with ESLint for your tests to catch errors early. Use @typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises ESLint rule to make sure there are no missing awaits before the asynchronous calls to the Playwright API. On your CI you can run tsc --noEmit to ensure that functions are called with the right signature.
Use parallelism and sharding
Playwright runs tests in parallel by default. Tests in a single file are run in order, in the same worker process. If you have many independent tests in a single file, you might want to run them in parallel
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' });

test('runs in parallel 1', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
test('runs in parallel 2', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
Playwright can shard a test suite, so that it can be executed on multiple machines.
npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright test --shard=1/3
Productivity tips
Use Soft assertions
If your test fails, Playwright will give you an error message showing what part of the test failed which you can see either in VS Code, the terminal, the HTML report, or the trace viewer. However, you can also use soft assertions. These do not immediately terminate the test execution, but rather compile and display a list of failed assertions once the test ended.
// Make a few checks that will not stop the test when failed...
await expect.soft(page.getByTestId('status')).toHaveText('Success');

// ... and continue the test to check more things.
await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'next page' }).click();

Browsers
Introduction
Each version of Playwright needs specific versions of browser binaries to operate. You will need to use the Playwright CLI to install these browsers.
With every release, Playwright updates the versions of the browsers it supports, so that the latest Playwright would support the latest browsers at any moment. It means that every time you update Playwright, you might need to re-run the install CLI command.
Install browsers
Playwright can install supported browsers. Running the command without arguments will install the default browsers.
npx playwright install
You can also install specific browsers by providing an argument:
npx playwright install webkit
See all supported browsers:
npx playwright install --help
Install system dependencies
System dependencies can get installed automatically. This is useful for CI environments.
npx playwright install-deps
You can also install the dependencies for a single browser by passing it as an argument:
npx playwright install-deps chromium
It's also possible to combine install-deps with install so that the browsers and OS dependencies are installed with a single command.
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
See system requirements for officially supported operating systems.
Update Playwright regularly
By keeping your Playwright version up to date you will be able to use new features and test your app on the latest browser versions and catch failures before the latest browser version is released to the public.
# Update playwright
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest

# Install new browsers
npx playwright install
Check the release notes to see what the latest version is and what changes have been released.
# See what version of Playwright you have by running the following command
npx playwright --version
Configure Browsers
Playwright can run tests on Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers as well as branded browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It can also run on emulated tablet and mobile devices. See the registry of device parameters for a complete list of selected desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
Run tests on different browsers
Playwright can run your tests in multiple browsers and configurations by setting up projects in the config. You can also add different options for each project.
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   /* Test against desktop browsers */
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
   },
   {
     name: 'firefox',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
   },
   {
     name: 'webkit',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
   },
   /* Test against mobile viewports. */
   {
     name: 'Mobile Chrome',
     use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] },
   },
   {
     name: 'Mobile Safari',
     use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] },
   },
   /* Test against branded browsers. */
   {
     name: 'Google Chrome',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'], channel: 'chrome' }, // or 'chrome-beta'
   },
   {
     name: 'Microsoft Edge',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Edge'], channel: 'msedge' }, // or 'msedge-dev'
   },
 ],
});
Playwright will run all projects by default.
npx playwright test

Running 7 tests using 5 workers

 â [Microsoft Edge] âº example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test (2s)
Use the --project command line option to run a single project.
npx playwright test --project=firefox

Running 1 test using 1 worker

 â [firefox] âº example.spec.ts:3:1 âº basic test (2s)
With the VS Code extension you can run your tests on different browsers by checking the checkbox next to the browser name in the Playwright sidebar. These names are defined in your Playwright config file under the projects section. The default config when installing Playwright gives you 3 projects, Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. The first project is selected by default.

To run tests on multiple projects(browsers), select each project by checking the checkboxes next to the project name.

Chromium
For Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, by default, Playwright uses open source Chromium builds. Since the Chromium project is ahead of the branded browsers, when the world is on Google Chrome N, Playwright already supports Chromium N+1 that will be released in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge a few weeks later.
Chromium: headless shell
Playwright ships a regular Chromium build for headed operations and a separate chromium headless shell for headless mode.
If you are only running tests in headless shell (i.e. the channel option is not specified), for example on CI, you can avoid downloading the full Chromium browser by passing --only-shell during installation.
# only running tests headlessly
npx playwright install --with-deps --only-shell
Chromium: new headless mode
You can opt into the new headless mode by using 'chromium' channel. As official Chrome documentation puts it:
New Headless on the other hand is the real Chrome browser, and is thus more authentic, reliable, and offers more features. This makes it more suitable for high-accuracy end-to-end web app testing or browser extension testing.
See issue #33566 for details.
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   {
     name: 'chromium',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'], channel: 'chromium' },
   },
 ],
});
With the new headless mode, you can skip downloading the headless shell during browser installation by using the --no-shell option:
# only running tests headlessly
npx playwright install --with-deps --no-shell
Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge
While Playwright can download and use the recent Chromium build, it can operate against the branded Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers available on the machine (note that Playwright doesn't install them by default). In particular, the current Playwright version will support Stable and Beta channels of these browsers.
Available channels are chrome, msedge, chrome-beta, msedge-beta, chrome-dev, msedge-dev, chrome-canary, msedge-canary.
WARNING
Certain Enterprise Browser Policies may impact Playwright's ability to launch and control Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Running in an environment with browser policies is outside of the Playwright project's scope.
WARNING
Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge have switched to a new headless mode implementation that is closer to a regular headed mode. This differs from chromium headless shell that is used in Playwright by default when running headless, so expect different behavior in some cases. See issue #33566 for details.
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 projects: [
   /* Test against branded browsers. */
   {
     name: 'Google Chrome',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'], channel: 'chrome' }, // or 'chrome-beta'
   },
   {
     name: 'Microsoft Edge',
     use: { ...devices['Desktop Edge'], channel: 'msedge' }, // or "msedge-beta" or 'msedge-dev'
   },
 ],
});
Installing Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge
If Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge is not available on your machine, you can install them using the Playwright command line tool:
npx playwright install msedge
WARNING
Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge installations will be installed at the default global location of your operating system overriding your current browser installation.
Run with the --help option to see a full a list of browsers that can be installed.
When to use Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge and when not to?
Defaults
Using the default Playwright configuration with the latest Chromium is a good idea most of the time. Since Playwright is ahead of Stable channels for the browsers, it gives peace of mind that the upcoming Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge releases won't break your site. You catch breakage early and have a lot of time to fix it before the official Chrome update.
Regression testing
Having said that, testing policies often require regression testing to be performed against the current publicly available browsers. In this case, you can opt into one of the stable channels, "chrome" or "msedge".
Media codecs
Another reason for testing using official binaries is to test functionality related to media codecs. Chromium does not have all the codecs that Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge are bundling due to various licensing considerations and agreements. If your site relies on this kind of codecs (which is rarely the case), you will also want to use the official channel.
Enterprise policy
Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge respect enterprise policies, which include limitations to the capabilities, network proxy, mandatory extensions that stand in the way of testing. So if you are part of the organization that uses such policies, it is easiest to use bundled Chromium for your local testing, you can still opt into stable channels on the bots that are typically free of such restrictions.
Firefox
Playwright's Firefox version matches the recent Firefox Stable build. Playwright doesn't work with the branded version of Firefox since it relies on patches.
Note that availability of certain features, which depend heavily on the underlying platform, may vary between operating systems. For example, available media codecs vary substantially between Linux, macOS and Windows.
WebKit
Playwright's WebKit is derived from the latest WebKit main branch sources, often before these updates are incorporated into Apple Safari and other WebKit-based browsers. This gives a lot of lead time to react on the potential browser update issues. Playwright doesn't work with the branded version of Safari since it relies on patches. Instead, you can test using the most recent WebKit build.
Note that availability of certain features, which depend heavily on the underlying platform, may vary between operating systems. For example, available media codecs vary substantially between Linux, macOS and Windows. While running WebKit on Linux CI is usually the most affordable option, for the closest-to-Safari experience you should run WebKit on mac, for example if you do video playback.
Install behind a firewall or a proxy
By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN.
Sometimes companies maintain an internal proxy that blocks direct access to the public resources. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download browsers via a proxy server.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 npx playwright install
If the requests of the proxy get intercepted with a custom untrusted certificate authority (CA) and it yields to Error: self signed certificate in certificate chain while downloading the browsers, you must set your custom root certificates via the NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS environment variable before installing the browsers:
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="/path/to/cert.pem"
If your network is slow to connect to Playwright browser archive, you can increase the connection timeout in milliseconds with PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT environment variable:
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=120000 npx playwright install
If you are installing dependencies and need to use a proxy on Linux, make sure to run the command as a root user. Otherwise, Playwright will attempt to become a root and will not pass environment variables like HTTPS_PROXY to the linux package manager.
sudo HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 npx playwright install-deps
Download from artifact repository
By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN.
Sometimes companies maintain an internal artifact repository to host browser binaries. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download from a custom location using the PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST env variable.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 npx playwright install
It is also possible to use a per-browser download hosts using PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD_HOST, PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST and PLAYWRIGHT_WEBKIT_DOWNLOAD_HOST env variables that take precedence over PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://203.0.113.3 PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 npx playwright install
Managing browser binaries
Playwright downloads Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers into the OS-specific cache folders:
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright on Windows
~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright on macOS
~/.cache/ms-playwright on Linux
These browsers will take a few hundred megabytes of disk space when installed:
du -hs ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/*
281M  chromium-XXXXXX
187M  firefox-XXXX
180M  webkit-XXXX
You can override default behavior using environment variables. When installing Playwright, ask it to download browsers into a specific location:
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers npx playwright install
When running Playwright scripts, ask it to search for browsers in a shared location.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers npx playwright test
Playwright keeps track of packages that need those browsers and will garbage collect them as you update Playwright to the newer versions.
NOTE
Developers can opt-in in this mode via exporting PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers in their .bashrc.
Hermetic install
You can opt into the hermetic install and place binaries in the local folder:
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
# Places binaries to node_modules/playwright-core/.local-browsers
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0 npx playwright install
NOTE
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH does not change installation path for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
Stale browser removal
Playwright keeps track of the clients that use its browsers. When there are no more clients that require a particular version of the browser, that version is deleted from the system. That way you can safely use Playwright instances of different versions and at the same time, you don't waste disk space for the browsers that are no longer in use.
To opt-out from the unused browser removal, you can set the PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_GC=1 environment variable.
List all installed browsers:
Prints list of browsers from all playwright installations on the machine.
npx playwright install --list
Uninstall browsers
This will remove the browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit) of the current Playwright installation:
npx playwright uninstall
To remove browsers of other Playwright installations as well, pass --all flag:
npx playwright uninstall --all

Chrome extensions
Introduction
NOTE
Extensions only work in Chrome / Chromium launched with a persistent context. Use custom browser args at your own risk, as some of them may break Playwright functionality.
The snippet below retrieves the service worker of a Manifest v3 extension whose source is located in ./my-extension.
Note the use of the chromium channel that allows to run extensions in headless mode. Alternatively, you can launch the browser in headed mode.
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
 const pathToExtension = require('path').join(__dirname, 'my-extension');
 const userDataDir = '/tmp/test-user-data-dir';
 const browserContext = await chromium.launchPersistentContext(userDataDir, {
   channel: 'chromium',
   args: [
     `--disable-extensions-except=${pathToExtension}`,
     `--load-extension=${pathToExtension}`
   ]
 });
 let [serviceWorker] = browserContext.serviceWorkers();
 if (!serviceWorker)
   serviceWorker = await browserContext.waitForEvent('serviceworker');

 // Test the service worker as you would any other worker.
 await browserContext.close();
})();
Testing
To have the extension loaded when running tests you can use a test fixture to set the context. You can also dynamically retrieve the extension id and use it to load and test the popup page for example.
Note the use of the chromium channel that allows to run extensions in headless mode. Alternatively, you can launch the browser in headed mode.
First, add fixtures that will load the extension:
fixtures.ts
import { test as base, chromium, type BrowserContext } from '@playwright/test';
import path from 'path';

export const test = base.extend<{
 context: BrowserContext;
 extensionId: string;
}>({
 context: async ({ }, use) => {
   const pathToExtension = path.join(__dirname, 'my-extension');
   const context = await chromium.launchPersistentContext('', {
     channel: 'chromium',
     args: [
       `--disable-extensions-except=${pathToExtension}`,
       `--load-extension=${pathToExtension}`,
     ],
   });
   await use(context);
   await context.close();
 },
 extensionId: async ({ context }, use) => {
   // for manifest v3:
   let [serviceWorker] = context.serviceWorkers();
   if (!serviceWorker)
     serviceWorker = await context.waitForEvent('serviceworker');

   const extensionId = serviceWorker.url().split('/')[2];
   await use(extensionId);
 },
});
export const expect = test.expect;
Then use these fixtures in a test:
import { test, expect } from './fixtures';

test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://example.com');
 await expect(page.locator('body')).toHaveText('Changed by my-extension');
});

test('popup page', async ({ page, extensionId }) => {
 await page.goto(`chrome-extension://${extensionId}/popup.html`);
 await expect(page.locator('body')).toHaveText('my-extension popup');
});

Clock
Introduction
Accurately simulating time-dependent behavior is essential for verifying the correctness of applications. Utilizing Clock functionality allows developers to manipulate and control time within tests, enabling the precise validation of features such as rendering time, timeouts, scheduled tasks without the delays and variability of real-time execution.
The Clock API provides the following methods to control time:
setFixedTime: Sets the fixed time for Date.now() and new Date().
install: initializes the clock and allows you to:
pauseAt: Pauses the time at a specific time.
fastForward: Fast forwards the time.
runFor: Runs the time for a specific duration.
resume: Resumes the time.
setSystemTime: Sets the current system time.
The recommended approach is to use setFixedTime to set the time to a specific value. If that doesn't work for your use case, you can use install which allows you to pause time later on, fast forward it, tick it, etc. setSystemTime is only recommended for advanced use cases.
NOTE
page.clock overrides native global classes and functions related to time allowing them to be manually controlled:
Date
setTimeout
clearTimeout
setInterval
clearInterval
requestAnimationFrame
cancelAnimationFrame
requestIdleCallback
cancelIdleCallback
performance
Event.timeStamp
WARNING
If you call install at any point in your test, the call MUST occur before any other clock related calls (see note above for list). Calling these methods out of order will result in undefined behavior. For example, you cannot call setInterval, followed by install, then clearInterval, as install overrides the native definition of the clock functions.
Test with predefined time
Often you only need to fake Date.now while keeping the timers going. That way the time flows naturally, but Date.now always returns a fixed value.
<div id="current-time" data-testid="current-time"></div>
<script>
 const renderTime = () => {
   document.getElementById('current-time').textContent =
       new Date().toLocaleString();
 };
 setInterval(renderTime, 1000);
</script>
await page.clock.setFixedTime(new Date('2024-02-02T10:00:00'));
await page.goto('http://localhost:3333');
await expect(page.getByTestId('current-time')).toHaveText('2/2/2024, 10:00:00 AM');

await page.clock.setFixedTime(new Date('2024-02-02T10:30:00'));
// We know that the page has a timer that updates the time every second.
await expect(page.getByTestId('current-time')).toHaveText('2/2/2024, 10:30:00 AM');
Consistent time and timers
Sometimes your timers depend on Date.now and are confused when the Date.now value does not change over time. In this case, you can install the clock and fast forward to the time of interest when testing.
<div id="current-time" data-testid="current-time"></div>
<script>
 const renderTime = () => {
   document.getElementById('current-time').textContent =
       new Date().toLocaleString();
 };
 setInterval(renderTime, 1000);
</script>
// Initialize clock with some time before the test time and let the page load
// naturally. `Date.now` will progress as the timers fire.
await page.clock.install({ time: new Date('2024-02-02T08:00:00') });
await page.goto('http://localhost:3333');

// Pretend that the user closed the laptop lid and opened it again at 10am,
// Pause the time once reached that point.
await page.clock.pauseAt(new Date('2024-02-02T10:00:00'));

// Assert the page state.
await expect(page.getByTestId('current-time')).toHaveText('2/2/2024, 10:00:00 AM');

// Close the laptop lid again and open it at 10:30am.
await page.clock.fastForward('30:00');
await expect(page.getByTestId('current-time')).toHaveText('2/2/2024, 10:30:00 AM');
Test inactivity monitoring
Inactivity monitoring is a common feature in web applications that logs out users after a period of inactivity. Testing this feature can be tricky because you need to wait for a long time to see the effect. With the help of the clock, you can speed up time and test this feature quickly.
<div id="remaining-time" data-testid="remaining-time"></div>
<script>
 const endTime = Date.now() + 5 * 60_000;
 const renderTime = () => {
   const diffInSeconds = Math.round((endTime - Date.now()) / 1000);
   if (diffInSeconds <= 0) {
     document.getElementById('remaining-time').textContent =
       'You have been logged out due to inactivity.';
   } else {
     document.getElementById('remaining-time').textContent =
       `You will be logged out in ${diffInSeconds} seconds.`;
   }
   setTimeout(renderTime, 1000);
 };
 renderTime();
</script>
<button type="button">Interaction</button>
// Initial time does not matter for the test, so we can pick current time.
await page.clock.install();
await page.goto('http://localhost:3333');
// Interact with the page
await page.getByRole('button').click();

// Fast forward time 5 minutes as if the user did not do anything.
// Fast forward is like closing the laptop lid and opening it after 5 minutes.
// All the timers due will fire once immediately, as in the real browser.
await page.clock.fastForward('05:00');

// Check that the user was logged out automatically.
await expect(page.getByText('You have been logged out due to inactivity.')).toBeVisible();
Tick through time manually, firing all the timers consistently
In rare cases, you may want to tick through time manually, firing all timers and animation frames in the process to achieve a fine-grained control over the passage of time.
<div id="current-time" data-testid="current-time"></div>
<script>
 const renderTime = () => {
   document.getElementById('current-time').textContent =
       new Date().toLocaleString();
 };
 setInterval(renderTime, 1000);
</script>
// Initialize clock with a specific time, let the page load naturally.
await page.clock.install({ time: new Date('2024-02-02T08:00:00') });
await page.goto('http://localhost:3333');

// Pause the time flow, stop the timers, you now have manual control
// over the page time.
await page.clock.pauseAt(new Date('2024-02-02T10:00:00'));
await expect(page.getByTestId('current-time')).toHaveText('2/2/2024, 10:00:00 AM');

// Tick through time manually, firing all timers in the process.
// In this case, time will be updated in the screen 2 times.
await page.clock.runFor(2000);
await expect(page.getByTestId('current-time')).toHaveText('2/2/2024, 10:00:02 AM');

Components (experimental)
Introduction
Playwright Test can now test your components.
Example
Here is what a typical component test looks like:
test('event should work', async ({ mount }) => {
 let clicked = false;

 // Mount a component. Returns locator pointing to the component.
 const component = await mount(
   <Button title="Submit" onClick={() => { clicked = true }}></Button>
 );

 // As with any Playwright test, assert locator text.
 await expect(component).toContainText('Submit');

 // Perform locator click. This will trigger the event.
 await component.click();

 // Assert that respective events have been fired.
 expect(clicked).toBeTruthy();
});
How to get started
Adding Playwright Test to an existing project is easy. Below are the steps to enable Playwright Test for a React, Vue or Svelte project.
Step 1: Install Playwright Test for components for your respective framework
npm
yarn
pnpm
npm init playwright@latest -- --ct
This step creates several files in your workspace:
playwright/index.html
<html lang="en">
 <body>
   <div id="root"></div>
   <script type="module" src="./index.ts"></script>
 </body>
</html>
This file defines an html file that will be used to render components during testing. It must contain element with id="root", that's where components are mounted. It must also link the script called playwright/index.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}.
You can include stylesheets, apply theme and inject code into the page where component is mounted using this script. It can be either a .js, .ts, .jsx or .tsx file.
playwright/index.ts
// Apply theme here, add anything your component needs at runtime here.
Step 2. Create a test file src/App.spec.{ts,tsx}
React
Svelte
Vue
app.spec.tsx
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';
import App from './App';

test('should work', async ({ mount }) => {
 const component = await mount(<App />);
 await expect(component).toContainText('Learn React');
});
Step 3. Run the tests
You can run tests using the VS Code extension or the command line.
npm run test-ct
Further reading: configure reporting, browsers, tracing
Refer to Playwright config for configuring your project.
Test stories
When Playwright Test is used to test web components, tests run in Node.js, while components run in the real browser. This brings together the best of both worlds: components run in the real browser environment, real clicks are triggered, real layout is executed, visual regression is possible. At the same time, test can use all the powers of Node.js as well as all the Playwright Test features. As a result, the same parallel, parametrized tests with the same post-mortem Tracing story are available during component testing.
This however, is introducing a number of limitations:
You can't pass complex live objects to your component. Only plain JavaScript objects and built-in types like strings, numbers, dates etc. can be passed.
test('this will work', async ({ mount }) => {
 const component = await mount(<ProcessViewer process={{ name: 'playwright' }}/>);
});

test('this will not work', async ({ mount }) => {
 // `process` is a Node object, we can't pass it to the browser and expect it to work.
 const component = await mount(<ProcessViewer process={process}/>);
});
You can't pass data to your component synchronously in a callback:
test('this will not work', async ({ mount }) => {
 // () => 'red' callback lives in Node. If `ColorPicker` component in the browser calls the parameter function
 // `colorGetter` it won't get result synchronously. It'll be able to get it via await, but that is not how
 // components are typically built.
 const component = await mount(<ColorPicker colorGetter={() => 'red'}/>);
});
Working around these and other limitations is quick and elegant: for every use case of the tested component, create a wrapper of this component designed specifically for test. Not only it will mitigate the limitations, but it will also offer powerful abstractions for testing where you would be able to define environment, theme and other aspects of your component rendering.
Let's say you'd like to test following component:
input-media.tsx
import React from 'react';

type InputMediaProps = {
 // Media is a complex browser object we can't send to Node while testing.
 onChange(media: Media): void;
};

export function InputMedia(props: InputMediaProps) {
 return <></> as any;
}
Create a story file for your component:
input-media.story.tsx
import React from 'react';
import InputMedia from './import-media';

type InputMediaForTestProps = {
 onMediaChange(mediaName: string): void;
};

export function InputMediaForTest(props: InputMediaForTestProps) {
 // Instead of sending a complex `media` object to the test, send the media name.
 return <InputMedia onChange={media => props.onMediaChange(media.name)} />;
}
// Export more stories here.
Then test the component via testing the story:
input-media.spec.tsx
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';
import { InputMediaForTest } from './input-media.story.tsx';

test('changes the image', async ({ mount }) => {
 let mediaSelected: string | null = null;

 const component = await mount(
   <InputMediaForTest
     onMediaChange={mediaName => {
       mediaSelected = mediaName;
     }}
   />
 );
 await component
   .getByTestId('imageInput')
   .setInputFiles('src/assets/logo.png');

 await expect(component.getByAltText(/selected image/i)).toBeVisible();
 await expect.poll(() => mediaSelected).toBe('logo.png');
});
As a result, for every component you'll have a story file that exports all the stories that are actually tested. These stories live in the browser and "convert" complex object into the simple objects that can be accessed in the test.
Under the hood
Here is how component testing works:
Once the tests are executed, Playwright creates a list of components that the tests need.
It then compiles a bundle that includes these components and serves it using a local static web server.
Upon the mount call within the test, Playwright navigates to the facade page /playwright/index.html of this bundle and tells it to render the component.
Events are marshalled back to the Node.js environment to allow verification.
Playwright is using Vite to create the components bundle and serve it.
API reference
props
Provide props to a component when mounted.
React
Svelte
Vue
component.spec.tsx
import { test } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';

test('props', async ({ mount }) => {
 const component = await mount(<Component msg="greetings" />);
});
callbacks / events
Provide callbacks/events to a component when mounted.
React
Svelte
Vue
component.spec.tsx
import { test } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';

test('callback', async ({ mount }) => {
 const component = await mount(<Component onClick={() => {}} />);
});
children / slots
Provide children/slots to a component when mounted.
React
Svelte
Vue
component.spec.tsx
import { test } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';

test('children', async ({ mount }) => {
 const component = await mount(<Component>Child</Component>);
});
hooks
You can use beforeMount and afterMount hooks to configure your app. This lets you set up things like your app router, fake server etc. giving you the flexibility you need. You can also pass custom configuration from the mount call from a test, which is accessible from the hooksConfig fixture. This includes any config that needs to be run before or after mounting the component. An example of configuring a router is provided below:
React
Vue
playwright/index.tsx
import { beforeMount, afterMount } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react/hooks';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

export type HooksConfig = {
 enableRouting?: boolean;
}

beforeMount<HooksConfig>(async ({ App, hooksConfig }) => {
 if (hooksConfig?.enableRouting)
   return <BrowserRouter><App /></BrowserRouter>;
});
src/pages/ProductsPage.spec.tsx
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';
import type { HooksConfig } from '../playwright';
import { ProductsPage } from './pages/ProductsPage';

test('configure routing through hooks config', async ({ page, mount }) => {
 const component = await mount<HooksConfig>(<ProductsPage />, {
   hooksConfig: { enableRouting: true },
 });
 await expect(component.getByRole('link')).toHaveAttribute('href', '/products/42');
});
unmount
Unmount the mounted component from the DOM. This is useful for testing the component's behavior upon unmounting. Use cases include testing an "Are you sure you want to leave?" modal or ensuring proper cleanup of event handlers to prevent memory leaks.
React
Svelte
Vue
component.spec.tsx
import { test } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';

test('unmount', async ({ mount }) => {
 const component = await mount(<Component/>);
 await component.unmount();
});
update
Update props, slots/children, and/or events/callbacks of a mounted component. These component inputs can change at any time and are typically provided by the parent component, but sometimes it is necessary to ensure that your components behave appropriately to new inputs.
React
Svelte
Vue
component.spec.tsx
import { test } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';

test('update', async ({ mount }) => {
 const component = await mount(<Component/>);
 await component.update(
     <Component msg="greetings" onClick={() => {}}>Child</Component>
 );
});
Handling network requests
Playwright provides an experimental router fixture to intercept and handle network requests. There are two ways to use the router fixture:
Call router.route(url, handler) that behaves similarly to page.route(). See the network mocking guide for more details.
Call router.use(handlers) and pass MSW library request handlers to it.
Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.
import { handlers } from '@src/mocks/handlers';

test.beforeEach(async ({ router }) => {
 // install common handlers before each test
 await router.use(...handlers);
});

test('example test', async ({ mount }) => {
 // test as usual, your handlers are active
 // ...
});
You can also introduce a one-off handler for a specific test.
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw';

test('example test', async ({ mount, router }) => {
 await router.use(http.get('/data', async ({ request }) => {
   return HttpResponse.json({ value: 'mocked' });
 }));

 // test as usual, your handler is active
 // ...
});
Frequently asked questions
What's the difference between @playwright/test and @playwright/experimental-ct-{react,svelte,vue}?
test('â¦', async ({ mount, page, context }) => {
 // â¦
});
@playwright/experimental-ct-{react,svelte,vue} wrap @playwright/test to provide an additional built-in component-testing specific fixture called mount:
React
Svelte
Vue
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld';

test.use({ viewport: { width: 500, height: 500 } });

test('should work', async ({ mount }) => {
 const component = await mount(<HelloWorld msg="greetings" />);
 await expect(component).toContainText('Greetings');
});
Additionally, it adds some config options you can use in your playwright-ct.config.{ts,js}.
Finally, under the hood, each test re-uses the context and page fixture as a speed optimization for Component Testing. It resets them in between each test so it should be functionally equivalent to @playwright/test's guarantee that you get a new, isolated context and page fixture per-test.
I have a project that already uses Vite. Can I reuse the config?
At this point, Playwright is bundler-agnostic, so it is not reusing your existing Vite config. Your config might have a lot of things we won't be able to reuse. So for now, you would copy your path mappings and other high level settings into the ctViteConfig property of Playwright config.
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   ctViteConfig: {
     // ...
   },
 },
});
You can specify plugins via Vite config for testing settings. Note that once you start specifying plugins, you are responsible for specifying the framework plugin as well, vue() in this case:
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-vue';

import { resolve } from 'path';
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue';
import AutoImport from 'unplugin-auto-import/vite';
import Components from 'unplugin-vue-components/vite';

export default defineConfig({
 testDir: './tests/component',
 use: {
   trace: 'on-first-retry',
   ctViteConfig: {
     plugins: [
       vue(),
       AutoImport({
         imports: [
           'vue',
           'vue-router',
           '@vueuse/head',
           'pinia',
           {
             '@/store': ['useStore'],
           },
         ],
         dts: 'src/auto-imports.d.ts',
         eslintrc: {
           enabled: true,
         },
       }),
       Components({
         dirs: ['src/components'],
         extensions: ['vue'],
       }),
     ],
     resolve: {
       alias: {
         '@': resolve(__dirname, './src'),
       },
     },
   },
 },
});
How do I use CSS imports?
If you have a component that imports CSS, Vite will handle it automatically. You can also use CSS pre-processors such as Sass, Less, or Stylus, and Vite will handle them as well without any additional configuration. However, corresponding CSS pre-processor needs to be installed.
Vite has a hard requirement that all CSS Modules are named *.module.[css extension]. If you have a custom build config for your project normally and have imports of the form import styles from 'styles.css' you must rename your files to properly indicate they are to be treated as modules. You could also write a Vite plugin to handle this for you.
Check Vite documentation for more details.
How can I test components that uses Pinia?
Pinia needs to be initialized in playwright/index.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}. If you do this inside a beforeMount hook, the initialState can be overwritten on a per-test basis:
playwright/index.ts
import { beforeMount, afterMount } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-vue/hooks';
import { createTestingPinia } from '@pinia/testing';
import type { StoreState } from 'pinia';
import type { useStore } from '../src/store';

export type HooksConfig = {
 store?: StoreState<ReturnType<typeof useStore>>;
}

beforeMount<HooksConfig>(async ({ hooksConfig }) => {
 createTestingPinia({
   initialState: hooksConfig?.store,
   /**
    * Use http intercepting to mock api calls instead:
    * https://playwright.dev/docs/mock#mock-api-requests
    */
   stubActions: false,
   createSpy(args) {
     console.log('spy', args)
     return () => console.log('spy-returns')
   },
 });
});
src/pinia.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-vue';
import type { HooksConfig } from '../playwright';
import Store from './Store.vue';

test('override initialState ', async ({ mount }) => {
 const component = await mount<HooksConfig>(Store, {
   hooksConfig: {
     store: { name: 'override initialState' }
   }
 });
 await expect(component).toContainText('override initialState');
});
How do I access the component's methods or its instance?
Accessing a component's internal methods or its instance within test code is neither recommended nor supported. Instead, focus on observing and interacting with the component from a user's perspective, typically by clicking or verifying if something is visible on the page. Tests become less fragile and more valuable when they avoid interacting with internal implementation details, such as the component instance or its methods. Keep in mind that if a test fails when run from a userâs perspective, it likely means the automated test has uncovered a genuine bug in your code.

Debugging Tests
VS Code debugger
We recommend using the VS Code Extension for debugging for a better developer experience. With the VS Code extension you can debug your tests right in VS Code, see error messages, set breakpoints and step through your tests.

Error Messages
If your test fails VS Code will show you error messages right in the editor showing what was expected, what was received as well as a complete call log.

Live Debugging
You can debug your test live in VS Code. After running a test with the Show Browser option checked, click on any of the locators in VS Code and it will be highlighted in the Browser window. Playwright will also show you if there are multiple matches.

You can also edit the locators in VS Code and Playwright will show you the changes live in the browser window.

Picking a Locator
Pick a locator and copy it into your test file by clicking the Pick locator button form the testing sidebar. Then in the browser click the element you require and it will now show up in the Pick locator box in VS Code. Press 'enter' on your keyboard to copy the locator into the clipboard and then paste anywhere in your code. Or press 'escape' if you want to cancel.

Playwright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing role, text and test id locators. If Playwright finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient and uniquely identify the target element, so you don't have to worry about failing tests due to locators.
Run in Debug Mode
To set a breakpoint click next to the line number where you want the breakpoint to be until a red dot appears. Run the tests in debug mode by right clicking on the line next to the test you want to run.

A browser window will open and the test will run and pause at where the breakpoint is set. You can step through the tests, pause the test and rerun the tests from the menu in VS Code.

Debug Tests Using Chrome DevTools
Instead of using Debug Test, choose Run Test in VS Code. With Show Browser enabled, the browser session is reused, letting you open Chrome DevTools for continuous debugging of your tests and the web application.
Debug in different Browsers
By default, debugging is done using the Chromium profile. You can debug your tests on different browsers by right clicking on the debug icon in the testing sidebar and clicking on the 'Select Default Profile' option from the dropdown.

Then choose the test profile you would like to use for debugging your tests. Each time you run your test in debug mode it will use the profile you selected. You can run tests in debug mode by right clicking the line number where your test is and selecting 'Debug Test' from the menu.

To learn more about debugging, see Debugging in Visual Studio Code.
Playwright Inspector
The Playwright Inspector is a GUI tool to help you debug your Playwright tests. It allows you to step through your tests, live edit locators, pick locators and see actionability logs.

Run in debug mode
Run your tests with the --debug flag to open the inspector. This configures Playwright for debugging and opens the inspector. Additional useful defaults are configured when --debug is used:
Browsers launch in headed mode
Default timeout is set to 0 (= no timeout)
Debug all tests on all browsers
To debug all tests run the test command with the --debug flag. This will run tests one by one, and open the inspector and a browser window for each test.
npx playwright test --debug
Debug one test on all browsers
To debug one test on a specific line, run the test command followed by the name of the test file and the line number of the test you want to debug, followed by the --debug flag. This will run a single test in each browser configured in your playwright.config and open the inspector.
npx playwright test example.spec.ts:10 --debug
Debug on a specific browser
In Playwright you can configure projects in your playwright.config. Once configured you can then debug your tests on a specific browser or mobile viewport using the --project flag followed by the name of the project configured in your playwright.config.
npx playwright test --project=chromium --debug
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Safari" --debug
npx playwright test --project="Microsoft Edge" --debug
Debug one test on a specific browser
To run one test on a specific browser add the name of the test file and the line number of the test you want to debug as well as the --project flag followed by the name of the project.
npx playwright test example.spec.ts:10 --project=webkit --debug
Stepping through your tests
You can play, pause or step through each action of your test using the toolbar at the top of the Inspector. You can see the current action highlighted in the test code, and matching elements highlighted in the browser window.

Run a test from a specific breakpoint
To speed up the debugging process you can add a page.pause() method to your test. This way you won't have to step through each action of your test to get to the point where you want to debug.
await page.pause();
Once you add a page.pause() call, run your tests in debug mode. Clicking the "Resume" button in the Inspector will run the test and only stop on the page.pause().

Live editing locators
While running in debug mode you can live edit the locators. Next to the 'Pick Locator' button there is a field showing the locator that the test is paused on. You can edit this locator directly in the Pick Locator field, and matching elements will be highlighted in the browser window.

Picking locators
While debugging, you might need to choose a more resilient locator. You can do this by clicking on the Pick Locator button and hovering over any element in the browser window. While hovering over an element you will see the code needed to locate this element highlighted below. Clicking an element in the browser will add the locator into the field where you can then either tweak it or copy it into your code.

Playwright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing role, text and test id locators. If Playwright finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient and uniquely identify the target element, so you don't have to worry about failing tests due to locators.
Actionability logs
By the time Playwright has paused on a click action, it has already performed actionability checks that can be found in the log. This can help you understand what happened during your test and what Playwright did or tried to do. The log tells you if the element was visible, enabled and stable, if the locator resolved to an element, scrolled into view, and so much more. If actionability can't be reached, it will show the action as pending.

Trace Viewer
Playwright Trace Viewer is a GUI tool that lets you explore recorded Playwright traces of your tests. You can go back and forward through each action on the left side, and visually see what was happening during the action. In the middle of the screen, you can see a DOM snapshot for the action. On the right side you can see action details, such as time, parameters, return value and log. You can also explore console messages, network requests and the source code.
To learn more about how to record traces and use the Trace Viewer, check out the Trace Viewer guide.
Browser Developer Tools
When running in Debug Mode with PWDEBUG=console, a playwright object is available in the Developer tools console. Developer tools can help you to:
Inspect the DOM tree and find element selectors
See console logs during execution (or learn how to read logs via API)
Check network activity and other developer tools features
This will also set the default timeouts of Playwright to 0 (= no timeout).

To debug your tests using the browser developer tools, start by setting a breakpoint in your test to pause the execution using the page.pause() method.
await page.pause();
Once you have set a breakpoint in your test, you can then run your test with PWDEBUG=console.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
PWDEBUG=console npx playwright test
Once Playwright launches the browser window, you can open the developer tools. The playwright object will be available in the console panel.
playwright.$(selector)
Query the Playwright selector, using the actual Playwright query engine, for example:
playwright.$('.auth-form >> text=Log in');

<button>Log in</button>
playwright.$$(selector)
Same as playwright.$, but returns all matching elements.
playwright.$$('li >> text=John')

[<li>, <li>, <li>, <li>]
playwright.inspect(selector)
Reveal element in the Elements panel.
playwright.inspect('text=Log in')
playwright.locator(selector)
Create a locator and query matching elements, for example:
playwright.locator('.auth-form', { hasText: 'Log in' });

Locator ()
 - element: button
 - elements: [button]
playwright.selector(element)
Generates selector for the given element. For example, select an element in the Elements panel and pass $0:
playwright.selector($0)

"div[id="glow-ingress-block"] >> text=/.*Hello.*/"
Verbose API logs
Playwright supports verbose logging with the DEBUG environment variable.
Bash
PowerShell
Batch
DEBUG=pw:api npx playwright test
NOTE
For WebKit: launching WebKit Inspector during the execution will prevent the Playwright script from executing any further and will reset pre-configured user agent and device emulation.
Headed mode
Playwright runs browsers in headless mode by default. To change this behavior, use headless: false as a launch option.
You can also use the slowMo option to slow down execution (by N milliseconds per operation) and follow along while debugging.
// Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit
await chromium.launch({ headless: false, slowMo: 100 });

Dialogs
Introduction
Playwright can interact with the web page dialogs such as alert, confirm, prompt as well as beforeunload confirmation. For print dialogs, see Print.
alert(), confirm(), prompt() dialogs
By default, dialogs are auto-dismissed by Playwright, so you don't have to handle them. However, you can register a dialog handler before the action that triggers the dialog to either dialog.accept() or dialog.dismiss() it.
page.on('dialog', dialog => dialog.accept());
await page.getByRole('button').click();
NOTE
page.on('dialog') listener must handle the dialog. Otherwise your action will stall, be it locator.click() or something else. That's because dialogs in Web are modals and therefore block further page execution until they are handled.
As a result, the following snippet will never resolve:
WARNING
WRONG!
page.on('dialog', dialog => console.log(dialog.message()));
await page.getByRole('button').click(); // Will hang here
NOTE
If there is no listener for page.on('dialog'), all dialogs are automatically dismissed.
beforeunload dialog
When page.close() is invoked with the truthy runBeforeUnload value, the page runs its unload handlers. This is the only case when page.close() does not wait for the page to actually close, because it might be that the page stays open in the end of the operation.
You can register a dialog handler to handle the beforeunload dialog yourself:
page.on('dialog', async dialog => {
 assert(dialog.type() === 'beforeunload');
 await dialog.dismiss();
});
await page.close({ runBeforeUnload: true });
Print dialogs
In order to assert that a print dialog via window.print was triggered, you can use the following snippet:
await page.goto('<url>');

await page.evaluate('(() => {window.waitForPrintDialog = new Promise(f => window.print = f);})()');
await page.getByText('Print it!').click();

await page.waitForFunction('window.waitForPrintDialog');
This will wait for the print dialog to be opened after the button is clicked. Make sure to evaluate the script before clicking the button / after the page is loaded.

Downloads
Introduction
For every attachment downloaded by the page, page.on('download') event is emitted. All these attachments are downloaded into a temporary folder. You can obtain the download url, file name and payload stream using the Download object from the event.
You can specify where to persist downloaded files using the downloadsPath option in browserType.launch().
NOTE
Downloaded files are deleted when the browser context that produced them is closed.
Here is the simplest way to handle the file download:
// Start waiting for download before clicking. Note no await.
const downloadPromise = page.waitForEvent('download');
await page.getByText('Download file').click();
const download = await downloadPromise;

// Wait for the download process to complete and save the downloaded file somewhere.
await download.saveAs('/path/to/save/at/' + download.suggestedFilename());
Variations
If you have no idea what initiates the download, you can still handle the event:
page.on('download', download => download.path().then(console.log));
Note that handling the event forks the control flow and makes the script harder to follow. Your scenario might end while you are downloading a file since your main control flow is not awaiting for this operation to resolve.
NOTE
For uploading files, see the uploading files section.

Evaluating JavaScript
Introduction
Playwright scripts run in your Playwright environment. Your page scripts run in the browser page environment. Those environments don't intersect, they are running in different virtual machines in different processes and even potentially on different computers.
The page.evaluate() API can run a JavaScript function in the context of the web page and bring results back to the Playwright environment. Browser globals like window and document can be used in evaluate.
const href = await page.evaluate(() => document.location.href);
If the result is a Promise or if the function is asynchronous evaluate will automatically wait until it's resolved:
const status = await page.evaluate(async () => {
 const response = await fetch(location.href);
 return response.status;
});
Different environments
Evaluated scripts run in the browser environment, while your test runs in a testing environments. This means you cannot use variables from your test in the page and vice versa. Instead, you should pass them explicitly as an argument.
The following snippet is WRONG because it uses the variable directly:
const data = 'some data';
const result = await page.evaluate(() => {
 // WRONG: there is no "data" in the web page.
 window.myApp.use(data);
});
The following snippet is CORRECT because it passes the value explicitly as an argument:
const data = 'some data';
// Pass |data| as a parameter.
const result = await page.evaluate(data => {
 window.myApp.use(data);
}, data);
Evaluation Argument
Playwright evaluation methods like page.evaluate() take a single optional argument. This argument can be a mix of Serializable values and JSHandle instances. Handles are automatically converted to the value they represent.
// A primitive value.
await page.evaluate(num => num, 42);

// An array.
await page.evaluate(array => array.length, [1, 2, 3]);

// An object.
await page.evaluate(object => object.foo, { foo: 'bar' });

// A single handle.
const button = await page.evaluateHandle('window.button');
await page.evaluate(button => button.textContent, button);

// Alternative notation using JSHandle.evaluate.
await button.evaluate((button, from) => button.textContent.substring(from), 5);

// Object with multiple handles.
const button1 = await page.evaluateHandle('window.button1');
const button2 = await page.evaluateHandle('window.button2');
await page.evaluate(
   o => o.button1.textContent + o.button2.textContent,
   { button1, button2 });

// Object destructuring works. Note that property names must match
// between the destructured object and the argument.
// Also note the required parenthesis.
await page.evaluate(
   ({ button1, button2 }) => button1.textContent + button2.textContent,
   { button1, button2 });

// Array works as well. Arbitrary names can be used for destructuring.
// Note the required parenthesis.
await page.evaluate(
   ([b1, b2]) => b1.textContent + b2.textContent,
   [button1, button2]);

// Any mix of serializables and handles works.
await page.evaluate(
   x => x.button1.textContent + x.list[0].textContent + String(x.foo),
   { button1, list: [button2], foo: null });
Init scripts
Sometimes it is convenient to evaluate something in the page before it starts loading. For example, you might want to setup some mocks or test data.
In this case, use page.addInitScript() or browserContext.addInitScript(). In the example below, we will replace Math.random() with a constant value.
First, create a preload.js file that contains the mock.
// preload.js
Math.random = () => 42;
Next, add init script to the page.
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import path from 'path';

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
 // Add script for every test in the beforeEach hook.
 // Make sure to correctly resolve the script path.
 await page.addInitScript({ path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../mocks/preload.js') });
});
Alternatively, you can pass a function instead of creating a preload script file. This is more convenient for short or one-off scripts. You can also pass an argument this way.
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

// Add script for every test in the beforeEach hook.
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
 const value = 42;
 await page.addInitScript(value => {
   Math.random = () => value;
 }, value);
});

Events
Introduction
Playwright allows listening to various types of events happening on the web page, such as network requests, creation of child pages, dedicated workers etc. There are several ways to subscribe to such events, such as waiting for events or adding or removing event listeners.
Waiting for event
Most of the time, scripts will need to wait for a particular event to happen. Below are some of the typical event awaiting patterns.
Wait for a request with the specified url using page.waitForRequest():
// Start waiting for request before goto. Note no await.
const requestPromise = page.waitForRequest('**/*logo*.png');
await page.goto('https://wikipedia.org');
const request = await requestPromise;
console.log(request.url());
Wait for popup window:
// Start waiting for popup before clicking. Note no await.
const popupPromise = page.waitForEvent('popup');
await page.getByText('open the popup').click();
const popup = await popupPromise;
await popup.goto('https://wikipedia.org');
Adding/removing event listener
Sometimes, events happen in random time and instead of waiting for them, they need to be handled. Playwright supports traditional language mechanisms for subscribing and unsubscribing from the events:
page.on('request', request => console.log(`Request sent: ${request.url()}`));
const listener = request => console.log(`Request finished: ${request.url()}`);
page.on('requestfinished', listener);
await page.goto('https://wikipedia.org');

page.off('requestfinished', listener);
await page.goto('https://www.openstreetmap.org/');
Adding one-off listeners
If a certain event needs to be handled once, there is a convenience API for that:
page.once('dialog', dialog => dialog.accept('2021'));
await page.evaluate("prompt('Enter a number:')");

Custom selector engines
Playwright supports custom selector engines, registered with selectors.register().
Selector engine should have the following properties:
query function to query first element matching selector relative to the root.
queryAll function to query all elements matching selector relative to the root.
By default the engine is run directly in the frame's JavaScript context and, for example, can call an application-defined function. To isolate the engine from any JavaScript in the frame, but leave access to the DOM, register the engine with {contentScript: true} option. Content script engine is safer because it is protected from any tampering with the global objects, for example altering Node.prototype methods. All built-in selector engines run as content scripts. Note that running as a content script is not guaranteed when the engine is used together with other custom engines.
Selectors must be registered before creating the page.
An example of registering selector engine that queries elements based on a tag name:
baseTest.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

export { expect } from '@playwright/test';

// Must be a function that evaluates to a selector engine instance.
const createTagNameEngine = () => ({
 // Returns the first element matching given selector in the root's subtree.
 query(root, selector) {
   return root.querySelector(selector);
 },

 // Returns all elements matching given selector in the root's subtree.
 queryAll(root, selector) {
   return Array.from(root.querySelectorAll(selector));
 }
});

export const test = base.extend<{}, { selectorRegistration: void }>({
 // Register selectors once per worker.
 selectorRegistration: [async ({ playwright }, use) => {
   // Register the engine. Selectors will be prefixed with "tag=".
   await playwright.selectors.register('tag', createTagNameEngine);
   await use();
 }, { scope: 'worker', auto: true }],
});
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from './baseTest';

test('selector engine test', async ({ page }) => {
 // Now we can use 'tag=' selectors.
 const button = page.locator('tag=button');
 await button.click();

 // We can combine it with built-in locators.
 await page.locator('tag=div').getByText('Click me').click();

 // We can use it in any methods supporting selectors.
 await expect(page.locator('tag=button')).toHaveCount(3);
});

Frames
Introduction
A Page can have one or more Frame objects attached to it. Each page has a main frame and page-level interactions (like click) are assumed to operate in the main frame.
A page can have additional frames attached with the iframe HTML tag. These frames can be accessed for interactions inside the frame.
// Locate element inside frame
const username = await page.frameLocator('.frame-class').getByLabel('User Name');
await username.fill('John');
Frame objects
One can access frame objects using the page.frame() API:
// Get frame using the frame's name attribute

Handles
Handles
Introduction
Playwright can create handles to the page DOM elements or any other objects inside the page. These handles live in the Playwright process, whereas the actual objects live in the browser. There are two types of handles:
JSHandle to reference any JavaScript objects in the page
ElementHandle to reference DOM elements in the page, it has extra methods that allow performing actions on the elements and asserting their properties.
Since any DOM element in the page is also a JavaScript object, any ElementHandle is a JSHandle as well.
Handles are used to perform operations on those actual objects in the page. You can evaluate on a handle, get handle properties, pass handle as an evaluation parameter, serialize page object into JSON etc. See the JSHandle class API for these and methods.
API reference
JSHandle
ElementHandle
Here is the easiest way to obtain a JSHandle.
const jsHandle = await page.evaluateHandle('window');
//  Use jsHandle for evaluations.
Element Handles
DISCOURAGED
The use of ElementHandle is discouraged, use Locator objects and web-first assertions instead.
When ElementHandle is required, it is recommended to fetch it with the page.waitForSelector() or frame.waitForSelector() methods. These APIs wait for the element to be attached and visible.
// Get the element handle
const elementHandle = page.waitForSelector('#box');

// Assert bounding box for the element
const boundingBox = await elementHandle.boundingBox();
expect(boundingBox.width).toBe(100);

// Assert attribute for the element
const classNames = await elementHandle.getAttribute('class');
expect(classNames.includes('highlighted')).toBeTruthy();
Handles as parameters
Handles can be passed into the page.evaluate() and similar methods. The following snippet creates a new array in the page, initializes it with data and returns a handle to this array into Playwright. It then uses the handle in subsequent evaluations:
// Create new array in page.
const myArrayHandle = await page.evaluateHandle(() => {
 window.myArray = [1];
 return myArray;
});

// Get the length of the array.
const length = await page.evaluate(a => a.length, myArrayHandle);

// Add one more element to the array using the handle
await page.evaluate(arg => arg.myArray.push(arg.newElement), {
 myArray: myArrayHandle,
 newElement: 2
});

// Release the object when it's no longer needed.
await myArrayHandle.dispose();
Handle Lifecycle
Handles can be acquired using the page methods such as page.evaluateHandle(), page.$() or page.$$() or their frame counterparts frame.evaluateHandle(), frame.$() or frame.$$(). Once created, handles will retain object from garbage collection unless page navigates or the handle is manually disposed via the jsHandle.dispose() method.
API reference
JSHandle
ElementHandle
elementHandle.boundingBox()
elementHandle.getAttribute()
elementHandle.innerText()
elementHandle.innerHTML()
elementHandle.textContent()
jsHandle.evaluate()
page.evaluateHandle()
page.$()
page.$$()
Locator vs ElementHandle
CAUTION
We only recommend using ElementHandle in the rare cases when you need to perform extensive DOM traversal on a static page. For all user actions and assertions use locator instead.
The difference between the Locator and ElementHandle is that the latter points to a particular element, while Locator captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.
In the example below, handle points to a particular DOM element on page. If that element changes text or is used by React to render an entirely different component, handle is still pointing to that very stale DOM element. This can lead to unexpected behaviors.
const handle = await page.$('text=Submit');
// ...
await handle.hover();
await handle.click();
With the locator, every time the locator is used, up-to-date DOM element is located in the page using the selector. So in the snippet below, underlying DOM element is going to be located twice.
const locator = page.getByText('Submit');
// ...
await locator.hover();
await locator.click();

Isolation
Introduction
Tests written with Playwright execute in isolated clean-slate environments called browser contexts. This isolation model improves reproducibility and prevents cascading test failures.
What is Test Isolation?
Test Isolation is when each test is completely isolated from another test. Every test runs independently from any other test. This means that each test has its own local storage, session storage, cookies etc. Playwright achieves this using BrowserContexts which are equivalent to incognito-like profiles. They are fast and cheap to create and are completely isolated, even when running in a single browser. Playwright creates a context for each test, and provides a default Page in that context.
Why is Test Isolation Important?
No failure carry-over. If one test fails it doesn't affect the other test.
Easy to debug errors or flakiness, because you can run just a single test as many times as you'd like.
Don't have to think about the order when running in parallel, sharding, etc.
Two Ways of Test Isolation
There are two different strategies when it comes to Test Isolation: start from scratch or cleanup in between. The problem with cleaning up in between tests is that it can be easy to forget to clean up and some things are impossible to clean up such as "visited links". State from one test can leak into the next test which could cause your test to fail and make debugging harder as the problem comes from another test. Starting from scratch means everything is new, so if the test fails you only have to look within that test to debug.
How Playwright Achieves Test Isolation
Playwright uses browser contexts to achieve Test Isolation. Each test has its own Browser Context. Running the test creates a new browser context each time. When using Playwright as a Test Runner, browser contexts are created by default. Otherwise, you can create browser contexts manually.
Test
Library
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('example test', async ({ page, context }) => {
 // "context" is an isolated BrowserContext, created for this specific test.
 // "page" belongs to this context.
});

test('another test', async ({ page, context }) => {
 // "context" and "page" in this second test are completely
 // isolated from the first test.
});
Browser contexts can also be used to emulate multi-page scenarios involving mobile devices, permissions, locale and color scheme. Check out our Emulation guide for more details.
Multiple Contexts in a Single Test
Playwright can create multiple browser contexts within a single scenario. This is useful when you want to test for multi-user functionality, like a chat.
Test
Library
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('admin and user', async ({ browser }) => {
 // Create two isolated browser contexts
 const adminContext = await browser.newContext();
 const userContext = await browser.newContext();

 // Create pages and interact with contexts independently
 const adminPage = await adminContext.newPage();
 const userPage = await userContext.newPage();
});

Locators
Introduction
Locators are the central piece of Playwright's auto-waiting and retry-ability. In a nutshell, locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment.
Quick Guide
These are the recommended built-in locators.
page.getByRole() to locate by explicit and implicit accessibility attributes.
page.getByText() to locate by text content.
page.getByLabel() to locate a form control by associated label's text.
page.getByPlaceholder() to locate an input by placeholder.
page.getByAltText() to locate an element, usually image, by its text alternative.
page.getByTitle() to locate an element by its title attribute.
page.getByTestId() to locate an element based on its data-testid attribute (other attributes can be configured).
await page.getByLabel('User Name').fill('John');

await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('secret-password');

await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();

await expect(page.getByText('Welcome, John!')).toBeVisible();
Locating elements
Playwright comes with multiple built-in locators. To make tests resilient, we recommend prioritizing user-facing attributes and explicit contracts such as page.getByRole().
For example, consider the following DOM structure.
<button>Sign in</button>
Locate the element by its role of button with name "Sign in".
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();
NOTE
Use the code generator to generate a locator, and then edit it as you'd like.
Every time a locator is used for an action, an up-to-date DOM element is located in the page. In the snippet below, the underlying DOM element will be located twice, once prior to every action. This means that if the DOM changes in between the calls due to re-render, the new element corresponding to the locator will be used.
const locator = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' });

await locator.hover();
await locator.click();
Note that all methods that create a locator, such as page.getByLabel(), are also available on the Locator and FrameLocator classes, so you can chain them and iteratively narrow down your locator.
const locator = page
   .frameLocator('#my-frame')
   .getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' });

await locator.click();
Locate by role
The page.getByRole() locator reflects how users and assistive technology perceive the page, for example whether some element is a button or a checkbox. When locating by role, you should usually pass the accessible name as well, so that the locator pinpoints the exact element.
For example, consider the following DOM structure.
Sign up
 Subscribe

<h3>Sign up</h3>
<label>
 <input type="checkbox" /> Subscribe
</label>
<br/>
<button>Submit</button>
You can locate each element by its implicit role:
await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Sign up' })).toBeVisible();

await page.getByRole('checkbox', { name: 'Subscribe' }).check();

await page.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i }).click();
Role locators include buttons, checkboxes, headings, links, lists, tables, and many more and follow W3C specifications for ARIA role, ARIA attributes and accessible name. Note that many html elements like <button> have an implicitly defined role that is recognized by the role locator.
Note that role locators do not replace accessibility audits and conformance tests, but rather give early feedback about the ARIA guidelines.
WHEN TO USE ROLE LOCATORS
We recommend prioritizing role locators to locate elements, as it is the closest way to how users and assistive technology perceive the page.
Locate by label
Most form controls usually have dedicated labels that could be conveniently used to interact with the form. In this case, you can locate the control by its associated label using page.getByLabel().
For example, consider the following DOM structure.
Password 
<label>Password <input type="password" /></label>

You can fill the input after locating it by the label text:
await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('secret');
WHEN TO USE LABEL LOCATORS
Use this locator when locating form fields.
Locate by placeholder
Inputs may have a placeholder attribute to hint to the user what value should be entered. You can locate such an input using page.getByPlaceholder().
For example, consider the following DOM structure.
<input type="email" placeholder="name@example.com" />
You can fill the input after locating it by the placeholder text:
await page
   .getByPlaceholder('name@example.com')
   .fill('playwright@microsoft.com');
WHEN TO USE PLACEHOLDER LOCATORS
Use this locator when locating form elements that do not have labels but do have placeholder texts.
Locate by text
Find an element by the text it contains. You can match by a substring, exact string, or a regular expression when using page.getByText().
For example, consider the following DOM structure.
Welcome, John
<span>Welcome, John</span>
You can locate the element by the text it contains:
await expect(page.getByText('Welcome, John')).toBeVisible();
Set an exact match:
await expect(page.getByText('Welcome, John', { exact: true })).toBeVisible();
Match with a regular expression:
await expect(page.getByText(/welcome, [A-Za-z]+$/i)).toBeVisible();
NOTE
Matching by text always normalizes whitespace, even with exact match. For example, it turns multiple spaces into one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.
WHEN TO USE TEXT LOCATORS
We recommend using text locators to find non interactive elements like div, span, p, etc. For interactive elements like button, a, input, etc. use role locators.
You can also filter by text which can be useful when trying to find a particular item in a list.
Locate by alt text
All images should have an alt attribute that describes the image. You can locate an image based on the text alternative using page.getByAltText().
For example, consider the following DOM structure.

<img alt="playwright logo" src="/img/playwright-logo.svg" width="100" />
You can click on the image after locating it by the text alternative:
await page.getByAltText('playwright logo').click();
WHEN TO USE ALT LOCATORS
Use this locator when your element supports alt text such as img and area elements.
Locate by title
Locate an element with a matching title attribute using page.getByTitle().
For example, consider the following DOM structure.
25 issues
<span title='Issues count'>25 issues</span>
You can check the issues count after locating it by the title text:
await expect(page.getByTitle('Issues count')).toHaveText('25 issues');
WHEN TO USE TITLE LOCATORS
Use this locator when your element has the title attribute.
Locate by test id
Testing by test ids is the most resilient way of testing as even if your text or role of the attribute changes, the test will still pass. QA's and developers should define explicit test ids and query them with page.getByTestId(). However testing by test ids is not user facing. If the role or text value is important to you then consider using user facing locators such as role and text locators.
For example, consider the following DOM structure.
<button data-testid="directions">ItinÃ©raire</button>
You can locate the element by its test id:
await page.getByTestId('directions').click();
WHEN TO USE TESTID LOCATORS
You can also use test ids when you choose to use the test id methodology or when you can't locate by role or text.
Set a custom test id attribute
By default, page.getByTestId() will locate elements based on the data-testid attribute, but you can configure it in your test config or by calling selectors.setTestIdAttribute().
Set the test id to use a custom data attribute for your tests.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   testIdAttribute: 'data-pw'
 }
});
In your html you can now use data-pw as your test id instead of the default data-testid.
<button data-pw="directions">ItinÃ©raire</button>
And then locate the element as you would normally do:
await page.getByTestId('directions').click();
Locate by CSS or XPath
If you absolutely must use CSS or XPath locators, you can use page.locator() to create a locator that takes a selector describing how to find an element in the page. Playwright supports CSS and XPath selectors, and auto-detects them if you omit css= or xpath= prefix.
await page.locator('css=button').click();
await page.locator('xpath=//button').click();

await page.locator('button').click();
await page.locator('//button').click();
XPath and CSS selectors can be tied to the DOM structure or implementation. These selectors can break when the DOM structure changes. Long CSS or XPath chains below are an example of a bad practice that leads to unstable tests:
await page.locator(
   '#tsf > div:nth-child(2) > div.A8SBwf > div.RNNXgb > div > div.a4bIc > input'
).click();

await page
   .locator('//*[@id="tsf"]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div/div[2]/input')
   .click();
WHEN TO USE THIS
CSS and XPath are not recommended as the DOM can often change leading to non resilient tests. Instead, try to come up with a locator that is close to how the user perceives the page such as role locators or define an explicit testing contract using test ids.
Locate in Shadow DOM
All locators in Playwright by default work with elements in Shadow DOM. The exceptions are:
Locating by XPath does not pierce shadow roots.
Closed-mode shadow roots are not supported.
Consider the following example with a custom web component:
<x-details role=button aria-expanded=true aria-controls=inner-details>
 <div>Title</div>
 #shadow-root
   <div id=inner-details>Details</div>
</x-details>
You can locate in the same way as if the shadow root was not present at all.
To click <div>Details</div>:
await page.getByText('Details').click();
<x-details role=button aria-expanded=true aria-controls=inner-details>
 <div>Title</div>
 #shadow-root
   <div id=inner-details>Details</div>
</x-details>
To click <x-details>:
await page.locator('x-details', { hasText: 'Details' }).click();
<x-details role=button aria-expanded=true aria-controls=inner-details>
 <div>Title</div>
 #shadow-root
   <div id=inner-details>Details</div>
</x-details>
To ensure that <x-details> contains the text "Details":
await expect(page.locator('x-details')).toContainText('Details');
Filtering Locators
Consider the following DOM structure where we want to click on the buy button of the second product card. We have a few options in order to filter the locators to get the right one.
Product 1
Product 2
<ul>
 <li>
   <h3>Product 1</h3>
   <button>Add to cart</button>
 </li>
 <li>
   <h3>Product 2</h3>
   <button>Add to cart</button>
 </li>
</ul>
Filter by text
Locators can be filtered by text with the locator.filter() method. It will search for a particular string somewhere inside the element, possibly in a descendant element, case-insensitively. You can also pass a regular expression.
await page
   .getByRole('listitem')
   .filter({ hasText: 'Product 2' })
   .getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' })
   .click();
Use a regular expression:
await page
   .getByRole('listitem')
   .filter({ hasText: /Product 2/ })
   .getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' })
   .click();
Filter by not having text
Alternatively, filter by not having text:
// 5 in-stock items
await expect(page.getByRole('listitem').filter({ hasNotText: 'Out of stock' })).toHaveCount(5);
Filter by child/descendant
Locators support an option to only select elements that have or have not a descendant matching another locator. You can therefore filter by any other locator such as a locator.getByRole(), locator.getByTestId(), locator.getByText() etc.
Product 1
Product 2
<ul>
 <li>
   <h3>Product 1</h3>
   <button>Add to cart</button>
 </li>
 <li>
   <h3>Product 2</h3>
   <button>Add to cart</button>
 </li>
</ul>
await page
   .getByRole('listitem')
   .filter({ has: page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Product 2' }) })
   .getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' })
   .click();
We can also assert the product card to make sure there is only one:
await expect(page
   .getByRole('listitem')
   .filter({ has: page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Product 2' }) }))
   .toHaveCount(1);
The filtering locator must be relative to the original locator and is queried starting with the original locator match, not the document root. Therefore, the following will not work, because the filtering locator starts matching from the <ul> list element that is outside of the <li> list item matched by the original locator:
// â WRONG
await expect(page
   .getByRole('listitem')
   .filter({ has: page.getByRole('list').getByText('Product 2') }))
   .toHaveCount(1);
Filter by not having child/descendant
We can also filter by not having a matching element inside.
await expect(page
   .getByRole('listitem')
   .filter({ hasNot: page.getByText('Product 2') }))
   .toHaveCount(1);
Note that the inner locator is matched starting from the outer one, not from the document root.
Locator operators
Matching inside a locator
You can chain methods that create a locator, like page.getByText() or locator.getByRole(), to narrow down the search to a particular part of the page.
In this example we first create a locator called product by locating its role of listitem. We then filter by text. We can use the product locator again to get by role of button and click it and then use an assertion to make sure there is only one product with the text "Product 2".
const product = page.getByRole('listitem').filter({ hasText: 'Product 2' });

await product.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' }).click();

await expect(product).toHaveCount(1);
You can also chain two locators together, for example to find a "Save" button inside a particular dialog:
const saveButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' });
// ...
const dialog = page.getByTestId('settings-dialog');
await dialog.locator(saveButton).click();
Matching two locators simultaneously
Method locator.and() narrows down an existing locator by matching an additional locator. For example, you can combine page.getByRole() and page.getByTitle() to match by both role and title.
const button = page.getByRole('button').and(page.getByTitle('Subscribe'));
Matching one of the two alternative locators
If you'd like to target one of the two or more elements, and you don't know which one it will be, use locator.or() to create a locator that matches any one or both of the alternatives.
For example, consider a scenario where you'd like to click on a "New email" button, but sometimes a security settings dialog shows up instead. In this case, you can wait for either a "New email" button, or a dialog and act accordingly.
NOTE
If both "New email" button and security dialog appear on screen, the "or" locator will match both of them, possibly throwing the "strict mode violation" error. In this case, you can use locator.first() to only match one of them.
const newEmail = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'New' });
const dialog = page.getByText('Confirm security settings');
await expect(newEmail.or(dialog).first()).toBeVisible();
if (await dialog.isVisible())
 await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Dismiss' }).click();
await newEmail.click();
Matching only visible elements
NOTE
It's usually better to find a more reliable way to uniquely identify the element instead of checking the visibility.
Consider a page with two buttons, the first invisible and the second visible.
<button style='display: none'>Invisible</button>
<button>Visible</button>
This will find both buttons and throw a strictness violation error:
await page.locator('button').click();
This will only find a second button, because it is visible, and then click it.
await page.locator('button').filter({ visible: true }).click();
Lists
Count items in a list
You can assert locators in order to count the items in a list.
For example, consider the following DOM structure:
apple
banana
orange
<ul>
 <li>apple</li>
 <li>banana</li>
 <li>orange</li>
</ul>
Use the count assertion to ensure that the list has 3 items.
await expect(page.getByRole('listitem')).toHaveCount(3);
Assert all text in a list
You can assert locators in order to find all the text in a list.
For example, consider the following DOM structure:
apple
banana
orange
<ul>
 <li>apple</li>
 <li>banana</li>
 <li>orange</li>
</ul>
Use expect(locator).toHaveText() to ensure that the list has the text "apple", "banana" and "orange".
await expect(page
   .getByRole('listitem'))
   .toHaveText(['apple', 'banana', 'orange']);
Get a specific item
There are many ways to get a specific item in a list.
Get by text
Use the page.getByText() method to locate an element in a list by its text content and then click on it.
For example, consider the following DOM structure:
apple
banana
orange
<ul>
 <li>apple</li>
 <li>banana</li>
 <li>orange</li>
</ul>
Locate an item by its text content and click it.
await page.getByText('orange').click();
Filter by text
Use the locator.filter() to locate a specific item in a list.
For example, consider the following DOM structure:
apple
banana
orange
<ul>
 <li>apple</li>
 <li>banana</li>
 <li>orange</li>
</ul>
Locate an item by the role of "listitem" and then filter by the text of "orange" and then click it.
await page
   .getByRole('listitem')
   .filter({ hasText: 'orange' })
   .click();
Get by test id
Use the page.getByTestId() method to locate an element in a list. You may need to modify the html and add a test id if you don't already have a test id.
For example, consider the following DOM structure:
apple
banana
orange
<ul>
 <li data-testid='apple'>apple</li>
 <li data-testid='banana'>banana</li>
 <li data-testid='orange'>orange</li>
</ul>
Locate an item by its test id of "orange" and then click it.
await page.getByTestId('orange').click();
Get by nth item
If you have a list of identical elements, and the only way to distinguish between them is the order, you can choose a specific element from a list with locator.first(), locator.last() or locator.nth().
const banana = await page.getByRole('listitem').nth(1);
However, use this method with caution. Often times, the page might change, and the locator will point to a completely different element from the one you expected. Instead, try to come up with a unique locator that will pass the strictness criteria.
Chaining filters
When you have elements with various similarities, you can use the locator.filter() method to select the right one. You can also chain multiple filters to narrow down the selection.
For example, consider the following DOM structure:
John
Mary
John
Mary
<ul>
 <li>
   <div>John</div>
   <div><button>Say hello</button></div>
 </li>
 <li>
   <div>Mary</div>
   <div><button>Say hello</button></div>
 </li>
 <li>
   <div>John</div>
   <div><button>Say goodbye</button></div>
 </li>
 <li>
   <div>Mary</div>
   <div><button>Say goodbye</button></div>
 </li>
</ul>
To take a screenshot of the row with "Mary" and "Say goodbye":
const rowLocator = page.getByRole('listitem');

await rowLocator
   .filter({ hasText: 'Mary' })
   .filter({ has: page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Say goodbye' }) })
   .screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });
You should now have a "screenshot.png" file in your project's root directory.
Rare use cases
Do something with each element in the list
Iterate elements:
for (const row of await page.getByRole('listitem').all())
 console.log(await row.textContent());
Iterate using regular for loop:
const rows = page.getByRole('listitem');
const count = await rows.count();
for (let i = 0; i < count; ++i)
 console.log(await rows.nth(i).textContent());
Evaluate in the page
The code inside locator.evaluateAll() runs in the page, you can call any DOM apis there.
const rows = page.getByRole('listitem');
const texts = await rows.evaluateAll(
   list => list.map(element => element.textContent));
Strictness
Locators are strict. This means that all operations on locators that imply some target DOM element will throw an exception if more than one element matches. For example, the following call throws if there are several buttons in the DOM:
Throws an error if more than one
await page.getByRole('button').click();
On the other hand, Playwright understands when you perform a multiple-element operation, so the following call works perfectly fine when the locator resolves to multiple elements.
Works fine with multiple elements
await page.getByRole('button').count();
You can explicitly opt-out from strictness check by telling Playwright which element to use when multiple elements match, through locator.first(), locator.last(), and locator.nth(). These methods are not recommended because when your page changes, Playwright may click on an element you did not intend. Instead, follow best practices above to create a locator that uniquely identifies the target element.

Mock APIs
Introduction
Web APIs are usually implemented as HTTP endpoints. Playwright provides APIs to mock and modify network traffic, both HTTP and HTTPS. Any requests that a page does, including XHRs and fetch requests, can be tracked, modified and mocked. With Playwright you can also mock using HAR files that contain multiple network requests made by the page.
Mock API requests
The following code will intercept all the calls to */**/api/v1/fruits and will return a custom response instead. No requests to the API will be made. The test goes to the URL that uses the mocked route and asserts that mock data is present on the page.
test("mocks a fruit and doesn't call api", async ({ page }) => {
 // Mock the api call before navigating
 await page.route('*/**/api/v1/fruits', async route => {
   const json = [{ name: 'Strawberry', id: 21 }];
   await route.fulfill({ json });
 });
 // Go to the page
 await page.goto('https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking');

 // Assert that the Strawberry fruit is visible
 await expect(page.getByText('Strawberry')).toBeVisible();
});
You can see from the trace of the example test that the API was never called, it was however fulfilled with the mock data. 
Read more about advanced networking.
Modify API responses
Sometimes, it is essential to make an API request, but the response needs to be patched to allow for reproducible testing. In that case, instead of mocking the request, one can perform the request and fulfill it with the modified response.
In the example below we intercept the call to the fruit API and add a new fruit called 'Loquat', to the data. We then go to the url and assert that this data is there:
test('gets the json from api and adds a new fruit', async ({ page }) => {
 // Get the response and add to it
 await page.route('*/**/api/v1/fruits', async route => {
   const response = await route.fetch();
   const json = await response.json();
   json.push({ name: 'Loquat', id: 100 });
   // Fulfill using the original response, while patching the response body
   // with the given JSON object.
   await route.fulfill({ response, json });
 });

 // Go to the page
 await page.goto('https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking');

 // Assert that the new fruit is visible
 await expect(page.getByText('Loquat', { exact: true })).toBeVisible();
});
In the trace of our test we can see that the API was called and the response was modified. 
By inspecting the response we can see that our new fruit was added to the list. 
Read more about advanced networking.
Mocking with HAR files
A HAR file is an HTTP Archive file that contains a record of all the network requests that are made when a page is loaded. It contains information about the request and response headers, cookies, content, timings, and more. You can use HAR files to mock network requests in your tests. You'll need to:
Record a HAR file.
Commit the HAR file alongside the tests.
Route requests using the saved HAR files in the tests.
Recording a HAR file
To record a HAR file we use page.routeFromHAR() or browserContext.routeFromHAR() method. This method takes in the path to the HAR file and an optional object of options. The options object can contain the URL so that only requests with the URL matching the specified glob pattern will be served from the HAR File. If not specified, all requests will be served from the HAR file.
Setting update option to true will create or update the HAR file with the actual network information instead of serving the requests from the HAR file. Use it when creating a test to populate the HAR with real data.
test('records or updates the HAR file', async ({ page }) => {
 // Get the response from the HAR file
 await page.routeFromHAR('./hars/fruit.har', {
   url: '*/**/api/v1/fruits',
   update: true,
 });

 // Go to the page
 await page.goto('https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking');

 // Assert that the fruit is visible
 await expect(page.getByText('Strawberry')).toBeVisible();
});
Modifying a HAR file
Once you have recorded a HAR file you can modify it by opening the hashed .txt file inside your 'hars' folder and editing the JSON. This file should be committed to your source control. Anytime you run this test with update: true it will update your HAR file with the request from the API.
[
 {
   "name": "Playwright",
   "id": 100
 },
 // ... other fruits
]
Replaying from HAR
Now that you have the HAR file recorded and modified the mock data, it can be used to serve matching responses in the test. For this, just turn off or simply remove the update option. This will run the test against the HAR file instead of hitting the API.
test('gets the json from HAR and checks the new fruit has been added', async ({ page }) => {
 // Replay API requests from HAR.
 // Either use a matching response from the HAR,
 // or abort the request if nothing matches.
 await page.routeFromHAR('./hars/fruit.har', {
   url: '*/**/api/v1/fruits',
   update: false,
 });

 // Go to the page
 await page.goto('https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking');

 // Assert that the Playwright fruit is visible
 await expect(page.getByText('Playwright', { exact: true })).toBeVisible();
});
In the trace of our test we can see that the route was fulfilled from the HAR file and the API was not called. 
If we inspect the response we can see our new fruit was added to the JSON, which was done by manually updating the hashed .txt file inside the hars folder. 
HAR replay matches URL and HTTP method strictly. For POST requests, it also matches POST payloads strictly. If multiple recordings match a request, the one with the most matching headers is picked. An entry resulting in a redirect will be followed automatically.
Similar to when recording, if given HAR file name ends with .zip, it is considered an archive containing the HAR file along with network payloads stored as separate entries. You can also extract this archive, edit payloads or HAR log manually and point to the extracted har file. All the payloads will be resolved relative to the extracted har file on the file system.
Recording HAR with CLI
We recommend the update option to record HAR file for your test. However, you can also record the HAR with Playwright CLI.
Open the browser with Playwright CLI and pass --save-har option to produce a HAR file. Optionally, use --save-har-glob to only save requests you are interested in, for example API endpoints. If the har file name ends with .zip, artifacts are written as separate files and are all compressed into a single zip.
# Save API requests from example.com as "example.har" archive.
npx playwright open --save-har=example.har --save-har-glob="**/api/**" https://example.com
Read more about advanced networking.
Mock WebSockets
The following code will intercept WebSocket connections and mock entire communication over the WebSocket, instead of connecting to the server. This example responds to a "request" with a "response".
await page.routeWebSocket('wss://example.com/ws', ws => {
 ws.onMessage(message => {
   if (message === 'request')
     ws.send('response');
 });
});
Alternatively, you may want to connect to the actual server, but intercept messages in-between and modify or block them. Here is an example that modifies some of the messages sent by the page to the server, and leaves the rest unmodified.
await page.routeWebSocket('wss://example.com/ws', ws => {
 const server = ws.connectToServer();
 ws.onMessage(message => {
   if (message === 'request')
     server.send('request2');
   else
     server.send(message);
 });
});
For more details, see WebSocketRoute.

Mock browser APIs
Introduction
Playwright provides native support for most of the browser features. However, there are some experimental APIs and APIs which are not (yet) fully supported by all browsers. Playwright usually doesn't provide dedicated automation APIs in such cases. You can use mocks to test the behavior of your application in such cases. This guide gives a few examples.
Let's consider a web app that uses battery API to show your device's battery status. We'll mock the battery API and check that the page correctly displays the battery status.
Creating mocks
Since the page may be calling the API very early while loading it's important to setup all the mocks before the page started loading. The easiest way to achieve that is to call page.addInitScript():
await page.addInitScript(() => {
 const mockBattery = {
   level: 0.75,
   charging: true,
   chargingTime: 1800,
   dischargingTime: Infinity,
   addEventListener: () => { }
 };
 // Override the method to always return mock battery info.
 window.navigator.getBattery = async () => mockBattery;
});
Once this is done you can navigate the page and check its UI state:
// Configure mock API before each test.
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
 await page.addInitScript(() => {
   const mockBattery = {
     level: 0.90,
     charging: true,
     chargingTime: 1800, // seconds
     dischargingTime: Infinity,
     addEventListener: () => { }
   };
   // Override the method to always return mock battery info.
   window.navigator.getBattery = async () => mockBattery;
 });
});

test('show battery status', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('/');
 await expect(page.locator('.battery-percentage')).toHaveText('90%');
 await expect(page.locator('.battery-status')).toHaveText('Adapter');
 await expect(page.locator('.battery-fully')).toHaveText('00:30');
});

Mocking read-only APIs
Some APIs are read-only so you won't be able to assign to a navigator property. For example,
// Following line will have no effect.
navigator.cookieEnabled = true;
However, if the property is configurable, you can still override it using the plain JavaScript:
await page.addInitScript(() => {
 Object.defineProperty(Object.getPrototypeOf(navigator), 'cookieEnabled', { value: false });
});
Verifying API calls
Sometimes it is useful to check if the page made all expected APIs calls. You can record all API method invocations and then compare them with golden result. page.exposeFunction() may come in handy for passing message from the page back to the test code:
test('log battery calls', async ({ page }) => {
 const log = [];
 // Expose function for pushing messages to the Node.js script.
 await page.exposeFunction('logCall', msg => log.push(msg));
 await page.addInitScript(() => {
   const mockBattery = {
     level: 0.75,
     charging: true,
     chargingTime: 1800,
     dischargingTime: Infinity,
     // Log addEventListener calls.
     addEventListener: (name, cb) => logCall(`addEventListener:${name}`)
   };
   // Override the method to always return mock battery info.
   window.navigator.getBattery = async () => {
     logCall('getBattery');
     return mockBattery;
   };
 });

 await page.goto('/');
 await expect(page.locator('.battery-percentage')).toHaveText('75%');

 // Compare actual calls with golden.
 expect(log).toEqual([
   'getBattery',
   'addEventListener:chargingchange',
   'addEventListener:levelchange'
 ]);
});
Updating mock
To test that the app correctly reflects battery status updates it's important to make sure that the mock battery object fires same events that the browser implementation would. The following test demonstrates how to achieve that:
test('update battery status (no golden)', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.addInitScript(() => {
   // Mock class that will notify corresponding listeners when battery status changes.
   class BatteryMock {
     level = 0.10;
     charging = false;
     chargingTime = 1800;
     dischargingTime = Infinity;
     _chargingListeners = [];
     _levelListeners = [];
     addEventListener(eventName, listener) {
       if (eventName === 'chargingchange')
         this._chargingListeners.push(listener);
       if (eventName === 'levelchange')
         this._levelListeners.push(listener);
     }
     // Will be called by the test.
     _setLevel(value) {
       this.level = value;
       this._levelListeners.forEach(cb => cb());
     }
     _setCharging(value) {
       this.charging = value;
       this._chargingListeners.forEach(cb => cb());
     }
   }
   const mockBattery = new BatteryMock();
   // Override the method to always return mock battery info.
   window.navigator.getBattery = async () => mockBattery;
   // Save the mock object on window for easier access.
   window.mockBattery = mockBattery;
 });

 await page.goto('/');
 await expect(page.locator('.battery-percentage')).toHaveText('10%');

 // Update level to 27.5%
 await page.evaluate(() => window.mockBattery._setLevel(0.275));
 await expect(page.locator('.battery-percentage')).toHaveText('27.5%');
 await expect(page.locator('.battery-status')).toHaveText('Battery');

 // Emulate connected adapter
 await page.evaluate(() => window.mockBattery._setCharging(true));
 await expect(page.locator('.battery-status')).toHaveText('Adapter');
 await expect(page.locator('.battery-fully')).toHaveText('00:30');
});

Navigations
Introduction
Playwright can navigate to URLs and handle navigations caused by the page interactions.
Basic navigation
Simplest form of a navigation is opening a URL:
// Navigate the page
await page.goto('https://example.com');
The code above loads the page and waits for the web page to fire the load event. The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and images.
NOTE
If the page does a client-side redirect before load, page.goto() will wait for the redirected page to fire the load event.
When is the page loaded?
Modern pages perform numerous activities after the load event was fired. They fetch data lazily, populate UI, load expensive resources, scripts and styles after the load event was fired. There is no way to tell that the page is loaded, it depends on the page, framework, etc. So when can you start interacting with it?
In Playwright you can interact with the page at any moment. It will automatically wait for the target elements to become actionable.
// Navigate and click element
// Click will auto-wait for the element
await page.goto('https://example.com');
await page.getByText('Example Domain').click();
For the scenario above, Playwright will wait for the text to become visible, will wait for the rest of the actionability checks to pass for that element, and will click it.
Playwright operates as a very fast user - the moment it sees the button, it clicks it. In the general case, you don't need to worry about whether all the resources loaded, etc.
Hydration
At some point in time, you'll stumble upon a use case where Playwright performs an action, but nothing seemingly happens. Or you enter some text into the input field and it will disappear. The most probable reason behind that is a poor page hydration.
When page is hydrated, first, a static version of the page is sent to the browser. Then the dynamic part is sent and the page becomes "live". As a very fast user, Playwright will start interacting with the page the moment it sees it. And if the button on a page is enabled, but the listeners have not yet been added, Playwright will do its job, but the click won't have any effect.
A simple way to verify if your page suffers from a poor hydration is to open Chrome DevTools, pick "Slow 3G" network emulation in the Network panel and reload the page. Once you see the element of interest, interact with it. You'll see that the button clicks will be ignored and the entered text will be reset by the subsequent page load code. The right fix for this issue is to make sure that all the interactive controls are disabled until after the hydration, when the page is fully functional.
Waiting for navigation
Clicking an element could trigger multiple navigations. In these cases, it is recommended to explicitly page.waitForURL() to a specific url.
await page.getByText('Click me').click();
await page.waitForURL('**/login');
Navigation events
Playwright splits the process of showing a new document in a page into navigation and loading.
Navigation starts by changing the page URL or by interacting with the page (e.g., clicking a link). The navigation intent may be canceled, for example, on hitting an unresolved DNS address or transformed into a file download.
Navigation is committed when the response headers have been parsed and session history is updated. Only after the navigation succeeds (is committed), the page starts loading the document.
Loading covers getting the remaining response body over the network, parsing, executing the scripts and firing load events:
page.url() is set to the new url
document content is loaded over network and parsed
page.on('domcontentloaded') event is fired
page executes some scripts and loads resources like stylesheets and images
page.on('load') event is fired
page executes dynamically loaded scripts

Network
Introduction
Playwright provides APIs to monitor and modify browser network traffic, both HTTP and HTTPS. Any requests that a page does, including XHRs and fetch requests, can be tracked, modified and handled.
Mock APIs
Check out our API mocking guide to learn more on how to
mock API requests and never hit the API
perform the API request and modify the response
use HAR files to mock network requests.
Network mocking
You don't have to configure anything to mock network requests. Just define a custom Route that mocks network for a browser context.
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.beforeEach(async ({ context }) => {
 // Block any css requests for each test in this file.
 await context.route(/.css$/, route => route.abort());
});

test('loads page without css', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
 // ... test goes here
});
Alternatively, you can use page.route() to mock network in a single page.
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('loads page without images', async ({ page }) => {
 // Block png and jpeg images.
 await page.route(/(png|jpeg)$/, route => route.abort());

 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
 // ... test goes here
});
HTTP Authentication
Perform HTTP Authentication.
Test
Library
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   httpCredentials: {
     username: 'bill',
     password: 'pa55w0rd',
   }
 }
});
HTTP Proxy
You can configure pages to load over the HTTP(S) proxy or SOCKSv5. Proxy can be either set globally for the entire browser, or for each browser context individually.
You can optionally specify username and password for HTTP(S) proxy, you can also specify hosts to bypass the proxy for.
Here is an example of a global proxy:
Test
Library
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   proxy: {
     server: 'http://myproxy.com:3128',
     username: 'usr',
     password: 'pwd'
   }
 }
});
Its also possible to specify it per context:
Test
Library
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('should use custom proxy on a new context', async ({ browser }) => {
 const context = await browser.newContext({
   proxy: {
     server: 'http://myproxy.com:3128',
   }
 });
 const page = await context.newPage();

 await context.close();
});
Network events
You can monitor all the Requests and Responses:
// Subscribe to 'request' and 'response' events.
page.on('request', request => console.log('>>', request.method(), request.url()));
page.on('response', response => console.log('<<', response.status(), response.url()));

await page.goto('https://example.com');
Or wait for a network response after the button click with page.waitForResponse():
// Use a glob URL pattern. Note no await.
const responsePromise = page.waitForResponse('**/api/fetch_data');
await page.getByText('Update').click();
const response = await responsePromise;
Variations
Wait for Responses with page.waitForResponse()
// Use a RegExp. Note no await.
const responsePromise = page.waitForResponse(/\.jpeg$/);
await page.getByText('Update').click();
const response = await responsePromise;

// Use a predicate taking a Response object. Note no await.
const responsePromise = page.waitForResponse(response => response.url().includes(token));
await page.getByText('Update').click();
const response = await responsePromise;
Handle requests
await page.route('**/api/fetch_data', route => route.fulfill({
 status: 200,
 body: testData,
}));
await page.goto('https://example.com');
You can mock API endpoints via handling the network requests in your Playwright script.
Variations
Set up route on the entire browser context with browserContext.route() or page with page.route(). It will apply to popup windows and opened links.
await browserContext.route('**/api/login', route => route.fulfill({
 status: 200,
 body: 'accept',
}));
await page.goto('https://example.com');
Modify requests
// Delete header
await page.route('**/*', async route => {
 const headers = route.request().headers();
 delete headers['X-Secret'];
 await route.continue({ headers });
});

// Continue requests as POST.
await page.route('**/*', route => route.continue({ method: 'POST' }));
You can continue requests with modifications. Example above removes an HTTP header from the outgoing requests.
Abort requests
You can abort requests using page.route() and route.abort().
await page.route('**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg}', route => route.abort());

// Abort based on the request type
await page.route('**/*', route => {
 return route.request().resourceType() === 'image' ? route.abort() : route.continue();
});
Modify responses
To modify a response use APIRequestContext to get the original response and then pass the response to route.fulfill(). You can override individual fields on the response via options:
await page.route('**/title.html', async route => {
 // Fetch original response.
 const response = await route.fetch();
 // Add a prefix to the title.
 let body = await response.text();
 body = body.replace('<title>', '<title>My prefix:');
 await route.fulfill({
   // Pass all fields from the response.
   response,
   // Override response body.
   body,
   // Force content type to be html.
   headers: {
     ...response.headers(),
     'content-type': 'text/html'
   }
 });
});
Glob URL patterns
Playwright uses simplified glob patterns for URL matching in network interception methods like page.route() or page.waitForResponse(). These patterns support basic wildcards:
Asterisks:
A single * matches any characters except /
A double ** matches any characters including /
Question mark ? matches only question mark ?. If you want to match any character, use * instead.
Curly braces {} can be used to match a list of options separated by commas ,
Backslash \ can be used to escape any of special characters (note to escape backslash itself as \\)
Examples:
https://example.com/*.js matches https://example.com/file.js but not https://example.com/path/file.js
https://example.com/?page=1 matches https://example.com/?page=1 but not https://example.com
**/*.js matches both https://example.com/file.js and https://example.com/path/file.js
**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg} matches all image requests
Important notes:
The glob pattern must match the entire URL, not just a part of it.
When using globs for URL matching, consider the full URL structure, including the protocol and path separators.
For more complex matching requirements, consider using RegExp instead of glob patterns.
WebSockets
Playwright supports WebSockets inspection, mocking and modifying out of the box. See our API mocking guide to learn how to mock WebSockets.
Every time a WebSocket is created, the page.on('websocket') event is fired. This event contains the WebSocket instance for further web socket frames inspection:
page.on('websocket', ws => {
 console.log(`WebSocket opened: ${ws.url()}>`);
 ws.on('framesent', event => console.log(event.payload));
 ws.on('framereceived', event => console.log(event.payload));
 ws.on('close', () => console.log('WebSocket closed'));
});
Missing Network Events and Service Workers
Playwright's built-in browserContext.route() and page.route() allow your tests to natively route requests and perform mocking and interception.
If you're using Playwright's native browserContext.route() and page.route(), and it appears network events are missing, disable Service Workers by setting serviceWorkers to 'block'.
It might be that you are using a mock tool such as Mock Service Worker (MSW). While this tool works out of the box for mocking responses, it adds its own Service Worker that takes over the network requests, hence making them invisible to browserContext.route() and page.route(). If you are interested in both network testing and mocking, consider using built-in browserContext.route() and page.route() for response mocking.
If you're interested in not solely using Service Workers for testing and network mocking, but in routing and listening for requests made by Service Workers themselves, please see this experimental feature.

Other locators
Introduction
NOTE
Check out the main locators guide for most common and recommended locators.
In addition to recommended locators like page.getByRole() and page.getByText(), Playwright supports a variety of other locators described in this guide.
CSS locator
NOTE
We recommend prioritizing user-visible locators like text or accessible role instead of using CSS that is tied to the implementation and could break when the page changes.
Playwright can locate an element by CSS selector.
await page.locator('css=button').click();
Playwright augments standard CSS selectors in two ways:
CSS selectors pierce open shadow DOM.
Playwright adds custom pseudo-classes like :visible, :has-text(), :has(), :is(), :nth-match() and more.
CSS: matching by text
Playwright include a number of CSS pseudo-classes to match elements by their text content.
article:has-text("Playwright") - the :has-text() matches any element containing specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. Matching is case-insensitive, trims whitespace and searches for a substring.
For example, article:has-text("Playwright") matches <article><div>Playwright</div></article>.
Note that :has-text() should be used together with other CSS specifiers, otherwise it will match all the elements containing specified text, including the <body>.
// Wrong, will match many elements including <body>
await page.locator(':has-text("Playwright")').click();
// Correct, only matches the <article> element
await page.locator('article:has-text("Playwright")').click();


#nav-bar :text("Home") - the :text() pseudo-class matches the smallest element containing specified text. Matching is case-insensitive, trims whitespace and searches for a substring.
For example, this will find an element with text "Home" somewhere inside the #nav-bar element:
await page.locator('#nav-bar :text("Home")').click();
#nav-bar :text-is("Home") - the :text-is() pseudo-class matches the smallest element with exact text. Exact matching is case-sensitive, trims whitespace and searches for the full string.
For example, :text-is("Log") does not match <button>Log in</button> because <button> contains a single text node "Log in" that is not equal to "Log". However, :text-is("Log") matches <button> Log <span>in</span></button>, because <button> contains a text node " Log ".
Similarly, :text-is("Download") will not match <button>download</button> because it is case-sensitive.
#nav-bar :text-matches("reg?ex", "i") - the :text-matches() pseudo-class matches the smallest element with text content matching the JavaScript-like regex.
For example, :text-matches("Log\s*in", "i") matches <button>Login</button> and <button>log IN</button>.
NOTE
Text matching always normalizes whitespace. For example, it turns multiple spaces into one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.
NOTE
Input elements of the type button and submit are matched by their value instead of text content. For example, :text("Log in") matches <input type=button value="Log in">.
CSS: matching only visible elements
Playwright supports the :visible pseudo class in CSS selectors. For example, css=button matches all the buttons on the page, while css=button:visible only matches visible buttons. This is useful to distinguish elements that are very similar but differ in visibility.
Consider a page with two buttons, first invisible and second visible.
<button style='display: none'>Invisible</button>
<button>Visible</button>
This will find both buttons and throw a strictness violation error:
await page.locator('button').click();
This will only find a second button, because it is visible, and then click it.
await page.locator('button:visible').click();
CSS: elements that contain other elements
The :has() pseudo-class is an experimental CSS pseudo-class. It returns an element if any of the selectors passed as parameters relative to the :scope of the given element match at least one element.
Following snippet returns text content of an <article> element that has a <div class=promo> inside.
await page.locator('article:has(div.promo)').textContent();
CSS: elements matching one of the conditions
Comma-separated list of CSS selectors will match all elements that can be selected by one of the selectors in that list.
// Clicks a <button> that has either a "Log in" or "Sign in" text.
await page.locator('button:has-text("Log in"), button:has-text("Sign in")').click();
The :is() pseudo-class is an experimental CSS pseudo-class that may be useful for specifying a list of extra conditions on an element.
CSS: matching elements based on layout
NOTE
Matching based on layout may produce unexpected results. For example, a different element could be matched when layout changes by one pixel.
Sometimes, it is hard to come up with a good selector to the target element when it lacks distinctive features. In this case, using Playwright layout CSS pseudo-classes could help. These can be combined with regular CSS to pinpoint one of the multiple choices.
For example, input:right-of(:text("Password")) matches an input field that is to the right of text "Password" - useful when the page has multiple inputs that are hard to distinguish between each other.
Note that layout pseudo-classes are useful in addition to something else, like input. If you use a layout pseudo-class alone, like :right-of(:text("Password")), most likely you'll get not the input you are looking for, but some empty element in between the text and the target input.
Layout pseudo-classes use bounding client rect to compute distance and relative position of the elements.
:right-of(div > button) - Matches elements that are to the right of any element matching the inner selector, at any vertical position.
:left-of(div > button) - Matches elements that are to the left of any element matching the inner selector, at any vertical position.
:above(div > button) - Matches elements that are above any of the elements matching the inner selector, at any horizontal position.
:below(div > button) - Matches elements that are below any of the elements matching the inner selector, at any horizontal position.
:near(div > button) - Matches elements that are near (within 50 CSS pixels) any of the elements matching the inner selector.
Note that resulting matches are sorted by their distance to the anchor element, so you can use locator.first() to pick the closest one. This is only useful if you have something like a list of similar elements, where the closest is obviously the right one. However, using locator.first() in other cases most likely won't work as expected - it will not target the element you are searching for, but some other element that happens to be the closest like a random empty <div>, or an element that is scrolled out and is not currently visible.
// Fill an input to the right of "Username".
await page.locator('input:right-of(:text("Username"))').fill('value');

// Click a button near the promo card.
await page.locator('button:near(.promo-card)').click();

// Click the radio input in the list closest to the "Label 3".
await page.locator('[type=radio]:left-of(:text("Label 3"))').first().click();
All layout pseudo-classes support optional maximum pixel distance as the last argument. For example button:near(:text("Username"), 120) matches a button that is at most 120 CSS pixels away from the element with the text "Username".
CSS: pick n-th match from the query result
NOTE
It is usually possible to distinguish elements by some attribute or text content, which is more resilient to page changes.
Sometimes page contains a number of similar elements, and it is hard to select a particular one. For example:
<section> <button>Buy</button> </section>
<article><div> <button>Buy</button> </div></article>
<div><div> <button>Buy</button> </div></div>
In this case, :nth-match(:text("Buy"), 3) will select the third button from the snippet above. Note that index is one-based.
// Click the third "Buy" button
await page.locator(':nth-match(:text("Buy"), 3)').click();
:nth-match() is also useful to wait until a specified number of elements appear, using locator.waitFor().
// Wait until all three buttons are visible
await page.locator(':nth-match(:text("Buy"), 3)').waitFor();
NOTE
Unlike :nth-child(), elements do not have to be siblings, they could be anywhere on the page. In the snippet above, all three buttons match :text("Buy") selector, and :nth-match() selects the third button.
N-th element locator
You can narrow down query to the n-th match using the nth= locator passing a zero-based index.
// Click first button
await page.locator('button').locator('nth=0').click();

// Click last button
await page.locator('button').locator('nth=-1').click();
Parent element locator
When you need to target a parent element of some other element, most of the time you should locator.filter() by the child locator. For example, consider the following DOM structure:
<li><label>Hello</label></li>
<li><label>World</label></li>
If you'd like to target the parent <li> of a label with text "Hello", using locator.filter() works best:
const child = page.getByText('Hello');
const parent = page.getByRole('listitem').filter({ has: child });
Alternatively, if you cannot find a suitable locator for the parent element, use xpath=... Note that this method is not as reliable, because any changes to the DOM structure will break your tests. Prefer locator.filter() when possible.
const parent = page.getByText('Hello').locator('xpath=..');
React locator
NOTE
React locator is experimental and prefixed with _. The functionality might change in future.
React locator allows finding elements by their component name and property values. The syntax is very similar to CSS attribute selectors and supports all CSS attribute selector operators.
In React locator, component names are transcribed with CamelCase.
await page.locator('_react=BookItem').click();
More examples:
match by component: _react=BookItem
match by component and exact property value, case-sensitive: _react=BookItem[author = "Steven King"]
match by property value only, case-insensitive: _react=[author = "steven king" i]
match by component and truthy property value: _react=MyButton[enabled]
match by component and boolean value: _react=MyButton[enabled = false]
match by property value substring: _react=[author *= "King"]
match by component and multiple properties: _react=BookItem[author *= "king" i][year = 1990]
match by nested property value: _react=[some.nested.value = 12]
match by component and property value prefix: _react=BookItem[author ^= "Steven"]
match by component and property value suffix: _react=BookItem[author $= "Steven"]
match by component and key: _react=BookItem[key = '2']
match by property value regex: _react=[author = /Steven(\\s+King)?/i]
To find React element names in a tree use React DevTools.
NOTE
React locator supports React 15 and above.
NOTE
React locator, as well as React DevTools, only work against unminified application builds.
Vue locator
NOTE
Vue locator is experimental and prefixed with _. The functionality might change in future.
Vue locator allows finding elements by their component name and property values. The syntax is very similar to CSS attribute selectors and supports all CSS attribute selector operators.
In Vue locator, component names are transcribed with kebab-case.
await page.locator('_vue=book-item').click();
More examples:
match by component: _vue=book-item
match by component and exact property value, case-sensitive: _vue=book-item[author = "Steven King"]
match by property value only, case-insensitive: _vue=[author = "steven king" i]
match by component and truthy property value: _vue=my-button[enabled]
match by component and boolean value: _vue=my-button[enabled = false]
match by property value substring: _vue=[author *= "King"]
match by component and multiple properties: _vue=book-item[author *= "king" i][year = 1990]
match by nested property value: _vue=[some.nested.value = 12]
match by component and property value prefix: _vue=book-item[author ^= "Steven"]
match by component and property value suffix: _vue=book-item[author $= "Steven"]
match by property value regex: _vue=[author = /Steven(\\s+King)?/i]
To find Vue element names in a tree use Vue DevTools.
NOTE
Vue locator supports Vue2 and above.
NOTE
Vue locator, as well as Vue DevTools, only work against unminified application builds.
XPath locator
WARNING
We recommend prioritizing user-visible locators like text or accessible role instead of using XPath that is tied to the implementation and easily break when the page changes.
XPath locators are equivalent to calling Document.evaluate.
await page.locator('xpath=//button').click();
NOTE
Any selector string starting with // or .. are assumed to be an xpath selector. For example, Playwright converts '//html/body' to 'xpath=//html/body'.
NOTE
XPath does not pierce shadow roots.
XPath union
Pipe operator (|) can be used to specify multiple selectors in XPath. It will match all elements that can be selected by one of the selectors in that list.
// Waits for either confirmation dialog or load spinner.
await page.locator(
   `//span[contains(@class, 'spinner__loading')]|//div[@id='confirmation']`
).waitFor();
Label to form control retargeting
WARNING
We recommend locating by label text instead of relying to label-to-control retargeting.
Targeted input actions in Playwright automatically distinguish between labels and controls, so you can target the label to perform an action on the associated control.
For example, consider the following DOM structure: <label for="password">Password:</label><input id="password" type="password">. You can target the label by its "Password" text using page.getByText(). However, the following actions will be performed on the input instead of the label:
locator.click() will click the label and automatically focus the input field;
locator.fill() will fill the input field;
locator.inputValue() will return the value of the input field;
locator.selectText() will select text in the input field;
locator.setInputFiles() will set files for the input field with type=file;
locator.selectOption() will select an option from the select box.
// Fill the input by targeting the label.
await page.getByText('Password').fill('secret');
However, other methods will target the label itself, for example expect(locator).toHaveText() will assert the text content of the label, not the input field.
// Fill the input by targeting the label.
await expect(page.locator('label')).toHaveText('Password');
Legacy text locator
WARNING
We recommend the modern text locator instead.
Legacy text locator matches elements that contain passed text.
await page.locator('text=Log in').click();
Legacy text locator has a few variations:
text=Log in - default matching is case-insensitive, trims whitespace and searches for a substring. For example, text=Log matches <button>Log in</button>.
await page.locator('text=Log in').click();
text="Log in" - text body can be escaped with single or double quotes to search for a text node with exact content after trimming whitespace.
For example, text="Log" does not match <button>Log in</button> because <button> contains a single text node "Log in" that is not equal to "Log". However, text="Log" matches <button> Log <span>in</span></button>, because <button> contains a text node " Log ". This exact mode implies case-sensitive matching, so text="Download" will not match <button>download</button>.
Quoted body follows the usual escaping rules, e.g. use \" to escape double quote in a double-quoted string: text="foo\"bar".
await page.locator('text="Log in"').click();
/Log\s*in/i - body can be a JavaScript-like regex wrapped in / symbols. For example, text=/Log\s*in/i matches <button>Login</button> and <button>log IN</button>.
await page.locator('text=/Log\\s*in/i').click();
NOTE
String selectors starting and ending with a quote (either " or ') are assumed to be a legacy text locators. For example, "Log in" is converted to text="Log in" internally.
NOTE
Matching always normalizes whitespace. For example, it turns multiple spaces into one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.
NOTE
Input elements of the type button and submit are matched by their value instead of text content. For example, text=Log in matches <input type=button value="Log in">.
id, data-testid, data-test-id, data-test selectors
WARNING
We recommend locating by test id instead.
Playwright supports shorthand for selecting elements using certain attributes. Currently, only the following attributes are supported:
id
data-testid
data-test-id
data-test
// Fill an input with the id "username"
await page.locator('id=username').fill('value');

// Click an element with data-test-id "submit"
await page.locator('data-test-id=submit').click();
NOTE
Attribute selectors are not CSS selectors, so anything CSS-specific like :enabled is not supported. For more features, use a proper css selector, e.g. css=[data-test="login"]:enabled.
Chaining selectors
WARNING
We recommend chaining locators instead.
Selectors defined as engine=body or in short-form can be combined with the >> token, e.g. selector1 >> selector2 >> selectors3. When selectors are chained, the next one is queried relative to the previous one's result.
For example,
css=article >> css=.bar > .baz >> css=span[attr=value]
is equivalent to
document
   .querySelector('article')
   .querySelector('.bar > .baz')
   .querySelector('span[attr=value]');
If a selector needs to include >> in the body, it should be escaped inside a string to not be confused with chaining separator, e.g. text="some >> text".
Intermediate matches
WARNING
We recommend filtering by another locator to locate elements that contain other elements.
By default, chained selectors resolve to an element queried by the last selector. A selector can be prefixed with * to capture elements that are queried by an intermediate selector.
For example, css=article >> text=Hello captures the element with the text Hello, and *css=article >> text=Hello (note the *) captures the article element that contains some element with the text Hello.

Pages
Pages
Each BrowserContext can have multiple pages. A Page refers to a single tab or a popup window within a browser context. It should be used to navigate to URLs and interact with the page content.
// Create a page.
const page = await context.newPage();

// Navigate explicitly, similar to entering a URL in the browser.
await page.goto('http://example.com');
// Fill an input.
await page.locator('#search').fill('query');

// Navigate implicitly by clicking a link.
await page.locator('#submit').click();
// Expect a new url.
console.log(page.url());
Multiple pages
Each browser context can host multiple pages (tabs).
Each page behaves like a focused, active page. Bringing the page to front is not required.
Pages inside a context respect context-level emulation, like viewport sizes, custom network routes or browser locale.
// Create two pages
const pageOne = await context.newPage();
const pageTwo = await context.newPage();

// Get pages of a browser context
const allPages = context.pages();
Handling new pages
The page event on browser contexts can be used to get new pages that are created in the context. This can be used to handle new pages opened by target="_blank" links.
// Start waiting for new page before clicking. Note no await.
const pagePromise = context.waitForEvent('page');
await page.getByText('open new tab').click();
const newPage = await pagePromise;
// Interact with the new page normally.
await newPage.getByRole('button').click();
console.log(await newPage.title());
If the action that triggers the new page is unknown, the following pattern can be used.
// Get all new pages (including popups) in the context
context.on('page', async page => {
 await page.waitForLoadState();
 console.log(await page.title());
});
Handling popups
If the page opens a pop-up (e.g. pages opened by target="_blank" links), you can get a reference to it by listening to the popup event on the page.
This event is emitted in addition to the browserContext.on('page') event, but only for popups relevant to this page.
// Start waiting for popup before clicking. Note no await.
const popupPromise = page.waitForEvent('popup');
await page.getByText('open the popup').click();
const popup = await popupPromise;
// Interact with the new popup normally.
await popup.getByRole('button').click();
console.log(await popup.title());
If the action that triggers the popup is unknown, the following pattern can be used.
// Get all popups when they open
page.on('popup', async popup => {
 await popup.waitForLoadState();
 console.log(await popup.title());
});

Page object models
Introduction
Large test suites can be structured to optimize ease of authoring and maintenance. Page object models are one such approach to structure your test suite.
A page object represents a part of your web application. An e-commerce web application might have a home page, a listings page and a checkout page. Each of them can be represented by page object models.
Page objects simplify authoring by creating a higher-level API which suits your application and simplify maintenance by capturing element selectors in one place and create reusable code to avoid repetition.
Implementation
We will create a PlaywrightDevPage helper class to encapsulate common operations on the playwright.dev page. Internally, it will use the page object.
Test
Library
playwright-dev-page.ts
import { expect, type Locator, type Page } from '@playwright/test';

export class PlaywrightDevPage {
 readonly page: Page;
 readonly getStartedLink: Locator;
 readonly gettingStartedHeader: Locator;
 readonly pomLink: Locator;
 readonly tocList: Locator;

 constructor(page: Page) {
   this.page = page;
   this.getStartedLink = page.locator('a', { hasText: 'Get started' });
   this.gettingStartedHeader = page.locator('h1', { hasText: 'Installation' });
   this.pomLink = page.locator('li', {
     hasText: 'Guides',
   }).locator('a', {
     hasText: 'Page Object Model',
   });
   this.tocList = page.locator('article div.markdown ul > li > a');
 }

 async goto() {
   await this.page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
 }

 async getStarted() {
   await this.getStartedLink.first().click();
   await expect(this.gettingStartedHeader).toBeVisible();
 }

 async pageObjectModel() {
   await this.getStarted();
   await this.pomLink.click();
 }
}
Now we can use the PlaywrightDevPage class in our tests.
Test
Library
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { PlaywrightDevPage } from './playwright-dev-page';

test('getting started should contain table of contents', async ({ page }) => {
 const playwrightDev = new PlaywrightDevPage(page);
 await playwrightDev.goto();
 await playwrightDev.getStarted();
 await expect(playwrightDev.tocList).toHaveText([
   `How to install Playwright`,
   `What's Installed`,
   `How to run the example test`,
   `How to open the HTML test report`,
   `Write tests using web first assertions, page fixtures and locators`,
   `Run single test, multiple tests, headed mode`,
   `Generate tests with Codegen`,
   `See a trace of your tests`
 ]);
});

test('should show Page Object Model article', async ({ page }) => {
 const playwrightDev = new PlaywrightDevPage(page);
 await playwrightDev.goto();
 await playwrightDev.pageObjectModel();
 await expect(page.locator('article')).toContainText('Page Object Model is a common pattern');
});

Screenshots
Introduction
Here is a quick way to capture a screenshot and save it into a file:
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });
Screenshots API accepts many parameters for image format, clip area, quality, etc. Make sure to check them out.
Full page screenshots
Full page screenshot is a screenshot of a full scrollable page, as if you had a very tall screen and the page could fit it entirely.
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png', fullPage: true });
Capture into buffer
Rather than writing into a file, you can get a buffer with the image and post-process it or pass it to a third party pixel diff facility.
const buffer = await page.screenshot();
console.log(buffer.toString('base64'));
Element screenshot
Sometimes it is useful to take a screenshot of a single element.
await page.locator('.header').screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });

Snapshot testing
Overview
With Playwright's Snapshot testing you can assert the accessibility tree of a page against a predefined snapshot template.
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
await expect(page.getByRole('banner')).toMatchAriaSnapshot(`
 - banner:
   - heading /Playwright enables reliable end-to-end/ [level=1]
   - link "Get started"
   - link "Star microsoft/playwright on GitHub"
   - link /[\\d]+k\\+ stargazers on GitHub/
`);
Assertion testing vs Snapshot testing
Snapshot testing and assertion testing serve different purposes in test automation:
Assertion testing
Assertion testing is a targeted approach where you assert specific values or conditions about elements or components. For instance, with Playwright, expect(locator).toHaveText() verifies that an element contains the expected text, and expect(locator).toHaveValue() confirms that an input field has the expected value. Assertion tests are specific and generally check the current state of an element or property against an expected, predefined state. They work well for predictable, single-value checks but are limited in scope when testing the broader structure or variations.
Advantages
Clarity: The intent of the test is explicit and easy to understand.
Specificity: Tests focus on particular aspects of functionality, making them more robust against unrelated changes.
Debugging: Failures provide targeted feedback, pointing directly to the problematic aspect.
Disadvantages
Verbose for complex outputs: Writing assertions for complex data structures or large outputs can be cumbersome and error-prone.
Maintenance overhead: As code evolves, manually updating assertions can be time-consuming.
Snapshot testing
Snapshot testing captures a âsnapshotâ or representation of the entire state of an element, component, or data at a given moment, which is then saved for future comparisons. When re-running tests, the current state is compared to the snapshot, and if there are differences, the test fails. This approach is especially useful for complex or dynamic structures, where manually asserting each detail would be too time-consuming. Snapshot testing is broader and more holistic than assertion testing, allowing you to track more complex changes over time.
Advantages
Simplifies complex outputs: For example, testing a UI component's rendered output can be tedious with traditional assertions. Snapshots capture the entire output for easy comparison.
Quick Feedback loop: Developers can easily spot unintended changes in the output.
Encourages consistency: Helps maintain consistent output as code evolves.
Disadvantages
Over-Reliance: It can be tempting to accept changes to snapshots without fully understanding them, potentially hiding bugs.
Granularity: Large snapshots may be hard to interpret when differences arise, especially if minor changes affect large portions of the output.
Suitability: Not ideal for highly dynamic content where outputs change frequently or unpredictably.
When to use
Snapshot testing is ideal for:
UI testing of whole pages and components.
Broad structural checks for complex UI components.
Regression testing for outputs that rarely change structure.
Assertion testing is ideal for:
Core logic validation.
Computed value testing.
Fine-grained tests requiring precise conditions.
By combining snapshot testing for broad, structural checks and assertion testing for specific functionality, you can achieve a well-rounded testing strategy.
Aria snapshots
In Playwright, aria snapshots provide a YAML representation of the accessibility tree of a page. These snapshots can be stored and compared later to verify if the page structure remains consistent or meets defined expectations.
The YAML format describes the hierarchical structure of accessible elements on the page, detailing roles, attributes, values, and text content. The structure follows a tree-like syntax, where each node represents an accessible element, and indentation indicates nested elements.
Each accessible element in the tree is represented as a YAML node:
- role "name" [attribute=value]
role: Specifies the ARIA or HTML role of the element (e.g., heading, list, listitem, button).
"name": Accessible name of the element. Quoted strings indicate exact values, /patterns/ are used for regular expression.
[attribute=value]: Attributes and values, in square brackets, represent specific ARIA attributes, such as checked, disabled, expanded, level, pressed, or selected.
These values are derived from ARIA attributes or calculated based on HTML semantics. To inspect the accessibility tree structure of a page, use the Chrome DevTools Accessibility Tab.
Snapshot matching
The expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot() assertion method in Playwright compares the accessible structure of the locator scope with a predefined aria snapshot template, helping validate the page's state against testing requirements.
For the following DOM:
<h1>title</h1>
You can match it using the following snapshot template:
await expect(page.locator('body')).toMatchAriaSnapshot(`
 - heading "title"
`);
When matching, the snapshot template is compared to the current accessibility tree of the page:
If the tree structure matches the template, the test passes; otherwise, it fails, indicating a mismatch between expected and actual accessibility states.
The comparison is case-sensitive and collapses whitespace, so indentation and line breaks are ignored.
The comparison is order-sensitive, meaning the order of elements in the snapshot template must match the order in the page's accessibility tree.
Partial matching
You can perform partial matches on nodes by omitting attributes or accessible names, enabling verification of specific parts of the accessibility tree without requiring exact matches. This flexibility is helpful for dynamic or irrelevant attributes.
<button>Submit</button>
aria snapshot
- button
In this example, the button role is matched, but the accessible name ("Submit") is not specified, allowing the test to pass regardless of the button's label.

For elements with ARIA attributes like checked or disabled, omitting these attributes allows partial matching, focusing solely on role and hierarchy.
<input type="checkbox" checked>
aria snapshot for partial match
- checkbox
In this partial match, the checked attribute is ignored, so the test will pass regardless of the checkbox state.

Similarly, you can partially match children in lists or groups by omitting specific list items or nested elements.
<ul>
 <li>Feature A</li>
 <li>Feature B</li>
 <li>Feature C</li>
</ul>
aria snapshot for partial match
- list
 - listitem: Feature B
Partial matches let you create flexible snapshot tests that verify essential page structure without enforcing specific content or attributes.
Strict matching
By default, a template containing the subset of children will be matched:
<ul>
 <li>Feature A</li>
 <li>Feature B</li>
 <li>Feature C</li>
</ul>
aria snapshot for partial match
- list
 - listitem: Feature B
The /children property can be used to control how child elements are matched:
contain (default): Matches if all specified children are present in order
equal: Matches if the children exactly match the specified list in order
deep-equal: Matches if the children exactly match the specified list in order, including nested children
<ul>
 <li>Feature A</li>
 <li>Feature B</li>
 <li>Feature C</li>
</ul>
aria snapshot will fail due to Feature C not being in the template
- list
 - /children: equal
 - listitem: Feature A
 - listitem: Feature B
Matching with regular expressions
Regular expressions allow flexible matching for elements with dynamic or variable text. Accessible names and text can support regex patterns.
<h1>Issues 12</h1>
aria snapshot with regular expression
- heading /Issues \d+/
Generating snapshots
Creating aria snapshots in Playwright helps ensure and maintain your application's structure. You can generate snapshots in various ways depending on your testing setup and workflow.
Generating snapshots with the Playwright code generator
If you're using Playwright's Code Generator, generating aria snapshots is streamlined with its interactive interface:
"Assert snapshot" Action: In the code generator, you can use the "Assert snapshot" action to automatically create a snapshot assertion for the selected elements. This is a quick way to capture the aria snapshot as part of your recorded test flow.
"Aria snapshot" Tab: The "Aria snapshot" tab within the code generator interface visually represents the aria snapshot for a selected locator, letting you explore, inspect, and verify element roles, attributes, and accessible names to aid snapshot creation and review.
Updating snapshots with @playwright/test and the --update-snapshots flag
When using the Playwright test runner (@playwright/test), you can automatically update snapshots with the --update-snapshots flag, -u for short.
Running tests with the --update-snapshots flag will update snapshots that did not match. Matching snapshots will not be updated.
npx playwright test --update-snapshots
Updating snapshots is useful when application structure changes require new snapshots as a baseline. Note that Playwright will wait for the maximum expect timeout specified in the test runner configuration to ensure the page is settled before taking the snapshot. It might be necessary to adjust the --timeout if the test hits the timeout while generating snapshots.
Empty template for snapshot generation
Passing an empty string as the template in an assertion generates a snapshot on-the-fly:
await expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot('');
Note that Playwright will wait for the maximum expect timeout specified in the test runner configuration to ensure the page is settled before taking the snapshot. It might be necessary to adjust the --timeout if the test hits the timeout while generating snapshots.
Snapshot patch files
When updating snapshots, Playwright creates patch files that capture differences. These patch files can be reviewed, applied, and committed to source control, allowing teams to track structural changes over time and ensure updates are consistent with application requirements.
The way source code is updated can be changed using the --update-source-method flag. There are several options available:
"patch" (default): Generates a unified diff file that can be applied to the source code using git apply.
"3way": Generates merge conflict markers in your source code, allowing you to choose whether to accept changes.
"overwrite": Overwrites the source code with the new snapshot values.
npx playwright test --update-snapshots --update-source-method=3way
Snapshots as separate files
To store your snapshots in a separate file, use the toMatchAriaSnapshot method with the name option, specifying a .aria.yml file extension.
await expect(page.getByRole('main')).toMatchAriaSnapshot({ name: 'main.aria.yml' });
By default, snapshots from a test file example.spec.ts are placed in the example.spec.ts-snapshots directory. As snapshots should be the same across browsers, only one snapshot is saved even if testing with multiple browsers. Should you wish, you can customize the snapshot path template using the following configuration:
export default defineConfig({
 expect: {
   toMatchAriaSnapshot: {
     pathTemplate: '__snapshots__/{testFilePath}/{arg}{ext}',
   },
 },
});
Using the Locator.ariaSnapshot method
The locator.ariaSnapshot() method allows you to programmatically create a YAML representation of accessible elements within a locator's scope, especially helpful for generating snapshots dynamically during test execution.
Example:
const snapshot = await page.locator('body').ariaSnapshot();
console.log(snapshot);
This command outputs the aria snapshot within the specified locator's scope in YAML format, which you can validate or store as needed.
Accessibility tree examples
Headings with level attributes
Headings can include a level attribute indicating their heading level.
<h1>Title</h1>
<h2>Subtitle</h2>
aria snapshot
- heading "Title" [level=1]
- heading "Subtitle" [level=2]
Text nodes
Standalone or descriptive text elements appear as text nodes.
<div>Sample accessible name</div>
aria snapshot
- text: Sample accessible name
Inline multiline text
Multiline text, such as paragraphs, is normalized in the aria snapshot.
<p>Line 1<br>Line 2</p>
aria snapshot
- paragraph: Line 1 Line 2
Links
Links display their text or composed content from pseudo-elements.
<a href="#more-info">Read more about Accessibility</a>
aria snapshot
- link "Read more about Accessibility"
Text boxes
Input elements of type text show their value attribute content.
<input type="text" value="Enter your name">
aria snapshot
- textbox: Enter your name
Lists with items
Ordered and unordered lists include their list items.
<ul aria-label="Main Features">
 <li>Feature 1</li>
 <li>Feature 2</li>
</ul>
aria snapshot
- list "Main Features":
 - listitem: Feature 1
 - listitem: Feature 2
Grouped elements
Groups capture nested elements, such as <details> elements with summary content.
<details>
 <summary>Summary</summary>
 <p>Detail content here</p>
</details>
aria snapshot
- group: Summary
Attributes and states
Commonly used ARIA attributes, like checked, disabled, expanded, level, pressed, and selected, represent control states.
Checkbox with checked attribute
<input type="checkbox" checked>
aria snapshot
- checkbox [checked]
Button with pressed attribute
<button aria-pressed="true">Toggle</button>
aria snapshot
- button "Toggle" [pressed=true]

Test generator
Introduction
Playwright comes with the ability to generate tests for you as you perform actions in the browser and is a great way to quickly get started with testing. Playwright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing role, text and test id locators. If the generator finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient that uniquely identify the target element.
Generate tests in VS Code
Install the VS Code extension and generate tests directly from VS Code. The extension is available on the VS Code Marketplace. Check out our guide on getting started with VS Code.
Record a New Test
To record a test click on the Record new button from the Testing sidebar. This will create a test-1.spec.ts file as well as open up a browser window.

In the browser go to the URL you wish to test and start clicking around to record your user actions.

Playwright will record your actions and generate the test code directly in VS Code. You can also generate assertions by choosing one of the icons in the toolbar and then clicking on an element on the page to assert against. The following assertions can be generated:
'assert visibility' to assert that an element is visible
'assert text' to assert that an element contains specific text
'assert value' to assert that an element has a specific value

Once you are done recording click the cancel button or close the browser window. You can then inspect your test-1.spec.ts file and manually improve it if needed.

Record at Cursor
To record from a specific point in your test move your cursor to where you want to record more actions and then click the Record at cursor button from the Testing sidebar. If your browser window is not already open then first run the test with 'Show browser' checked and then click the Record at cursor button.

In the browser window start performing the actions you want to record.

In the test file in VS Code you will see your new generated actions added to your test at the cursor position.

Generating locators
You can generate locators with the test generator.
Click on the Pick locator button form the testing sidebar and then hover over elements in the browser window to see the locator highlighted underneath each element.
Click the element you require and it will now show up in the Pick locator box in VS Code.
Press Enter on your keyboard to copy the locator into the clipboard and then paste anywhere in your code. Or press 'escape' if you want to cancel.

Generate tests with the Playwright Inspector
When running the codegen command two windows will be opened, a browser window where you interact with the website you wish to test and the Playwright Inspector window where you can record your tests and then copy them into your editor.
Running Codegen
Use the codegen command to run the test generator followed by the URL of the website you want to generate tests for. The URL is optional and you can always run the command without it and then add the URL directly into the browser window instead.
npx playwright codegen demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
Recording a test
Run the codegen command and perform actions in the browser window. Playwright will generate the code for the user interactions which you can see in the Playwright Inspector window. Once you have finished recording your test stop the recording and press the copy button to copy your generated test into your editor.
With the test generator you can record:
Actions like click or fill by simply interacting with the page
Assertions by clicking on one of the icons in the toolbar and then clicking on an element on the page to assert against. You can choose:
'assert visibility' to assert that an element is visible
'assert text' to assert that an element contains specific text
'assert value' to assert that an element has a specific value

When you have finished interacting with the page, press the record button to stop the recording and use the copy button to copy the generated code to your editor.
Use the clear button to clear the code to start recording again. Once finished, close the Playwright inspector window or stop the terminal command.
Generating locators
You can generate locators with the test generator.
Press the 'Record' button to stop the recording and the 'Pick Locator' button will appear.
Click on the 'Pick Locator' button and then hover over elements in the browser window to see the locator highlighted underneath each element.
To choose a locator, click on the element you would like to locate and the code for that locator will appear in the field next to the Pick Locator button.
You can then edit the locator in this field to fine tune it or use the copy button to copy it and paste it into your code.

Emulation
You can use the test generator to generate tests using emulation so as to generate a test for a specific viewport, device, color scheme, as well as emulate the geolocation, language or timezone. The test generator can also generate a test while preserving authenticated state.
Emulate viewport size
Playwright opens a browser window with its viewport set to a specific width and height and is not responsive as tests need to be run under the same conditions. Use the --viewport option to generate tests with a different viewport size.
npx playwright codegen --viewport-size="800,600" playwright.dev

Emulate devices
Record scripts and tests while emulating a mobile device using the --device option which sets the viewport size and user agent among others.
npx playwright codegen --device="iPhone 13" playwright.dev

Emulate color scheme
Record scripts and tests while emulating the color scheme with the --color-scheme option.
npx playwright codegen --color-scheme=dark playwright.dev

Emulate geolocation, language and timezone
Record scripts and tests while emulating timezone, language & location using the --timezone, --geolocation and --lang options. Once the page opens:
Accept the cookies
On the top right, click on the locate me button to see geolocation in action.
npx playwright codegen --timezone="Europe/Rome" --geolocation="41.890221,12.492348" --lang="it-IT" bing.com/maps

Preserve authenticated state
Run codegen with --save-storage to save cookies, localStorage and IndexedDB data at the end of the session. This is useful to separately record an authentication step and reuse it later when recording more tests.
npx playwright codegen github.com/microsoft/playwright --save-storage=auth.json

Login
After performing authentication and closing the browser, auth.json will contain the storage state which you can then reuse in your tests.

Make sure you only use the auth.json locally as it contains sensitive information. Add it to your .gitignore or delete it once you have finished generating your tests.
Load authenticated state
Run with --load-storage to consume the previously loaded storage from the auth.json. This way, all cookies, localStorage and IndexedDB data will be restored, bringing most web apps to the authenticated state without the need to login again. This means you can continue generating tests from the logged in state.
npx playwright codegen --load-storage=auth.json github.com/microsoft/playwright

Use existing userDataDir
Run codegen with --user-data-dir to set a fixed user data directory for the browser session. If you create a custom browser user data directory, codegen will use this existing browser profile and have access to any authentication state present in that profile.
WARNING
As of Chrome 136, the default user data directory cannot be accessed via automated tooling, such as Playwright. You must create a separate user data directory for use in testing.
npx playwright codegen --user-data-dir=/path/to/your/browser/data/ github.com/microsoft/playwright
Record using custom setup
If you would like to use codegen in some non-standard setup (for example, use browserContext.route()), it is possible to call page.pause() that will open a separate window with codegen controls.
const { chromium } = require('@playwright/test');

(async () => {
 // Make sure to run headed.
 const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });

 // Setup context however you like.
 const context = await browser.newContext({ /* pass any options */ });
 await context.route('**/*', route => route.continue());

 // Pause the page, and start recording manually.
 const page = await context.newPage();
 await page.pause();
})();

Touch events (legacy)
Introduction
Web applications that handle legacy touch events to respond to gestures like swipe, pinch, and tap can be tested by manually dispatching TouchEvents to the page. The examples below demonstrate how to use locator.dispatchEvent() and pass Touch points as arguments.
Note that locator.dispatchEvent() does not set Event.isTrusted property. If your web page relies on it, make sure to disable isTrusted check during the test.
Emulating pan gesture
In the example below, we emulate pan gesture that is expected to move the map. The app under test only uses clientX/clientY coordinates of the touch point, so we initialize just that. In a more complex scenario you may need to also set pageX/pageY/screenX/screenY, if your app needs them.
import { test, expect, devices, type Locator } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({ ...devices['Pixel 7'] });

async function pan(locator: Locator, deltaX?: number, deltaY?: number, steps?: number) {
 const { centerX, centerY } = await locator.evaluate((target: HTMLElement) => {
   const bounds = target.getBoundingClientRect();
   const centerX = bounds.left + bounds.width / 2;
   const centerY = bounds.top + bounds.height / 2;
   return { centerX, centerY };
 });

 // Providing only clientX and clientY as the app only cares about those.
 const touches = [{
   identifier: 0,
   clientX: centerX,
   clientY: centerY,
 }];
 await locator.dispatchEvent('touchstart',
     { touches, changedTouches: touches, targetTouches: touches });

 steps = steps ?? 5;
 deltaX = deltaX ?? 0;
 deltaY = deltaY ?? 0;
 for (let i = 1; i <= steps; i++) {
   const touches = [{
     identifier: 0,
     clientX: centerX + deltaX * i / steps,
     clientY: centerY + deltaY * i / steps,
   }];
   await locator.dispatchEvent('touchmove',
       { touches, changedTouches: touches, targetTouches: touches });
 }

 await locator.dispatchEvent('touchend');
}

test(`pan gesture to move the map`, async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://www.google.com/maps/place/@37.4117722,-122.0713234,15z',
     { waitUntil: 'commit' });
 await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Keep using web' }).click();
 await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Keep using web' })).not.toBeVisible();
 // Get the map element.
 const met = page.locator('[data-test-id="met"]');
 for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)
   await pan(met, 200, 100);
 // Ensure the map has been moved.
 await expect(met).toHaveScreenshot();
});
Emulating pinch gesture
In the example below, we emulate pinch gesture, i.e. two touch points moving closer to each other. It is expected to zoom out the map. The app under test only uses clientX/clientY coordinates of touch points, so we initialize just that. In a more complex scenario you may need to also set pageX/pageY/screenX/screenY, if your app needs them.
import { test, expect, devices, type Locator } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({ ...devices['Pixel 7'] });

async function pinch(locator: Locator,
 arg: { deltaX?: number, deltaY?: number, steps?: number, direction?: 'in' | 'out' }) {
 const { centerX, centerY } = await locator.evaluate((target: HTMLElement) => {
   const bounds = target.getBoundingClientRect();
   const centerX = bounds.left + bounds.width / 2;
   const centerY = bounds.top + bounds.height / 2;
   return { centerX, centerY };
 });

 const deltaX = arg.deltaX ?? 50;
 const steps = arg.steps ?? 5;
 const stepDeltaX = deltaX / (steps + 1);

 // Two touch points equally distant from the center of the element.
 const touches = [
   {
     identifier: 0,
     clientX: centerX - (arg.direction === 'in' ? deltaX : stepDeltaX),
     clientY: centerY,
   },
   {
     identifier: 1,
     clientX: centerX + (arg.direction === 'in' ? deltaX : stepDeltaX),
     clientY: centerY,
   },
 ];
 await locator.dispatchEvent('touchstart',
     { touches, changedTouches: touches, targetTouches: touches });

 // Move the touch points towards or away from each other.
 for (let i = 1; i <= steps; i++) {
   const offset = (arg.direction === 'in' ? (deltaX - i * stepDeltaX) : (stepDeltaX * (i + 1)));
   const touches = [
     {
       identifier: 0,
       clientX: centerX - offset,
       clientY: centerY,
     },
     {
       identifier: 0,
       clientX: centerX + offset,
       clientY: centerY,
     },
   ];
   await locator.dispatchEvent('touchmove',
       { touches, changedTouches: touches, targetTouches: touches });
 }

 await locator.dispatchEvent('touchend', { touches: [], changedTouches: [], targetTouches: [] });
}

test(`pinch in gesture to zoom out the map`, async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://www.google.com/maps/place/@37.4117722,-122.0713234,15z',
     { waitUntil: 'commit' });
 await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Keep using web' }).click();
 await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Keep using web' })).not.toBeVisible();
 // Get the map element.
 const met = page.locator('[data-test-id="met"]');
 for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)
   await pinch(met, { deltaX: 40, direction: 'in' });
 // Ensure the map has been zoomed out.
 await expect(met).toHaveScreenshot();
});

Trace viewer
Introduction
Playwright Trace Viewer is a GUI tool that helps you explore recorded Playwright traces after the script has run. Traces are a great way for debugging your tests when they fail on CI. You can open traces locally or in your browser on trace.playwright.dev.
Opening Trace Viewer
You can open a saved trace using either the Playwright CLI or in the browser at trace.playwright.dev. Make sure to add the full path to where your trace.zip file is located.
npx playwright show-trace path/to/trace.zip
Using trace.playwright.dev
trace.playwright.dev is a statically hosted variant of the Trace Viewer. You can upload trace files using drag and drop or via the Select file(s) button.
Trace Viewer loads the trace entirely in your browser and does not transmit any data externally.

Viewing remote traces
You can open remote traces directly using its URL. This makes it easy to view the remote trace without having to manually download the file from CI runs, for example.
npx playwright show-trace https://example.com/trace.zip
When using trace.playwright.dev, you can also pass the URL of your uploaded trace at some accessible storage (e.g. inside your CI) as a query parameter. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) rules might apply.
https://trace.playwright.dev/?trace=https://demo.playwright.dev/reports/todomvc/data/fa874b0d59cdedec675521c21124e93161d66533.zip
Recording a trace
Tracing locally
To record a trace during development mode set the --trace flag to on when running your tests. You can also use UI Mode for a better developer experience, as it traces each test automatically.
npx playwright test --trace on
You can then open the HTML report and click on the trace icon to open the trace.
npx playwright show-report
Tracing on CI
Traces should be run on continuous integration on the first retry of a failed test by setting the trace: 'on-first-retry' option in the test configuration file. This will produce a trace.zip file for each test that was retried.
Test
Library
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 retries: 1,
 use: {
   trace: 'on-first-retry',
 },
});
Available options to record a trace:
'on-first-retry' - Record a trace only when retrying a test for the first time.
'on-all-retries' - Record traces for all test retries.
'off' - Do not record a trace.
'on' - Record a trace for each test. (not recommended as it's performance heavy)
'retain-on-failure' - Record a trace for each test, but remove it from successful test runs.
You can also use trace: 'retain-on-failure' if you do not enable retries but still want traces for failed tests.
There are more granular options available, see testOptions.trace.
If you are not using Playwright as a Test Runner, use the browserContext.tracing API instead.
Trace Viewer features
Actions
In the Actions tab you can see what locator was used for every action and how long each one took to run. Hover over each action of your test and visually see the change in the DOM snapshot. Go back and forward in time and click an action to inspect and debug. Use the Before and After tabs to visually see what happened before and after the action.

Selecting each action reveals:
Action snapshots
Action log
Source code location
Screenshots
When tracing with the screenshots option turned on (default), each trace records a screencast and renders it as a film strip. You can hover over the film strip to see a magnified image of for each action and state which helps you easily find the action you want to inspect.
Double click on an action to see the time range for that action. You can use the slider in the timeline to increase the actions selected and these will be shown in the Actions tab and all console logs and network logs will be filtered to only show the logs for the actions selected.

Snapshots
When tracing with the snapshots option turned on (default), Playwright captures a set of complete DOM snapshots for each action. Depending on the type of the action, it will capture:
Type
Description
Before
A snapshot at the time action is called.
Action
A snapshot at the moment of the performed input. This type of snapshot is especially useful when exploring where exactly Playwright clicked.
After
A snapshot after the action.

Here is what the typical Action snapshot looks like:

Notice how it highlights both, the DOM Node as well as the exact click position.
Source
When you click on an action in the sidebar, the line of code for that action is highlighted in the source panel.

Call
The call tab shows you information about the action such as the time it took, what locator was used, if in strict mode and what key was used.

Log
See a full log of your test to better understand what Playwright is doing behind the scenes such as scrolling into view, waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable and performing actions such as click, fill, press etc.

Errors
If your test fails you will see the error messages for each test in the Errors tab. The timeline will also show a red line highlighting where the error occurred. You can also click on the source tab to see on which line of the source code the error is.

Console
See console logs from the browser as well as from your test. Different icons are displayed to show you if the console log came from the browser or from the test file.

Double click on an action from your test in the actions sidebar. This will filter the console to only show the logs that were made during that action. Click the Show all button to see all console logs again.
Use the timeline to filter actions, by clicking a start point and dragging to an ending point. The console tab will also be filtered to only show the logs that were made during the actions selected.
Network
The Network tab shows you all the network requests that were made during your test. You can sort by different types of requests, status code, method, request, content type, duration and size. Click on a request to see more information about it such as the request headers, response headers, request body and response body.

Double click on an action from your test in the actions sidebar. This will filter the network requests to only show the requests that were made during that action. Click the Show all button to see all network requests again.
Use the timeline to filter actions, by clicking a start point and dragging to an ending point. The network tab will also be filtered to only show the network requests that were made during the actions selected.
Metadata
Next to the Actions tab you will find the Metadata tab which will show you more information on your test such as the Browser, viewport size, test duration and more.

Attachments
The "Attachments" tab allows you to explore attachments. If you're doing visual regression testing, you'll be able to compare screenshots by examining the image diff, the actual image and the expected image. When you click on the expected image you can use the slider to slide one image over the other so you can easily see the differences in your screenshots.

Introduction
With Playwright you can record videos for your tests.
Record video
Playwright Test can record videos for your tests, controlled by the video option in your Playwright config. By default videos are off.
'off' - Do not record video.
'on' - Record video for each test.
'retain-on-failure' - Record video for each test, but remove all videos from successful test runs.
'on-first-retry' - Record video only when retrying a test for the first time.
Video files will appear in the test output directory, typically test-results. See testOptions.video for advanced video configuration.
Videos are saved upon browser context closure at the end of a test. If you create a browser context manually, make sure to await browserContext.close().
Test
Library
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   video: 'on-first-retry',
 },
});
You can also specify video size. The video size defaults to the viewport size scaled down to fit 800x800. The video of the viewport is placed in the top-left corner of the output video, scaled down to fit if necessary. You may need to set the viewport size to match your desired video size.
Test
Library
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 use: {
   video: {
     mode: 'on-first-retry',
     size: { width: 640, height: 480 }
   }
 },
});
For multi-page scenarios, you can access the video file associated with the page via the page.video().
const path = await page.video().path();
NOTE
Note that the video is only available after the page or browser context is closed.

Visual comparisons
Introduction
Playwright Test includes the ability to produce and visually compare screenshots using await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(). On first execution, Playwright test will generate reference screenshots. Subsequent runs will compare against the reference.
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
 await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot();
});
WARNING
Browser rendering can vary based on the host OS, version, settings, hardware, power source (battery vs. power adapter), headless mode, and other factors. For consistent screenshots, run tests in the same environment where the baseline screenshots were generated.
Generating screenshots
When you run above for the first time, test runner will say:
Error: A snapshot doesn't exist at example.spec.ts-snapshots/example-test-1-chromium-darwin.png, writing actual.
That's because there was no golden file yet. This method took a bunch of screenshots until two consecutive screenshots matched, and saved the last screenshot to file system. It is now ready to be added to the repository.
The name of the folder with the golden expectations starts with the name of your test file:
drwxr-xr-x  5 user  group  160 Jun  4 11:46 .
drwxr-xr-x  6 user  group  192 Jun  4 11:45 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 user  group  231 Jun  4 11:16 example.spec.ts
drwxr-xr-x  3 user  group   96 Jun  4 11:46 example.spec.ts-snapshots
The snapshot name example-test-1-chromium-darwin.png consists of a few parts:
example-test-1.png - an auto-generated name of the snapshot. Alternatively you can specify snapshot name as the first argument of the toHaveScreenshot() method:
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('landing.png');
chromium-darwin - the browser name and the platform. Screenshots differ between browsers and platforms due to different rendering, fonts and more, so you will need different snapshots for them. If you use multiple projects in your configuration file, project name will be used instead of chromium.
The snapshot name and path can be configured with testConfig.snapshotPathTemplate in the playwright config.
Note that toHaveScreenshot() also accepts an array of path segments to the snapshot file such as expect().toHaveScreenshot(['relative', 'path', 'to', 'snapshot.png']). However, this path must stay within the snapshots directory for each test file (i.e. a.spec.js-snapshots), otherwise it will throw.
Updating screenshots
Sometimes you need to update the reference screenshot, for example when the page has changed. Do this with the --update-snapshots flag.
npx playwright test --update-snapshots
Options
maxDiffPixels
Playwright Test uses the pixelmatch library. You can pass various options to modify its behavior:
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
 await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot({ maxDiffPixels: 100 });
});
If you'd like to share the default value among all the tests in the project, you can specify it in the playwright config, either globally or per project:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 expect: {
   toHaveScreenshot: { maxDiffPixels: 100 },
 },
});
stylePath
You can apply a custom stylesheet to your page while taking screenshot. This allows filtering out dynamic or volatile elements, hence improving the screenshot determinism.
screenshot.css
iframe {
 visibility: hidden;
}
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
 await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot({ stylePath: path.join(__dirname, 'screenshot.css') });
});
If you'd like to share the default value among all the tests in the project, you can specify it in the playwright config, either globally or per project:
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
 expect: {
   toHaveScreenshot: {
     stylePath: './screenshot.css'
   },
 },
});
Non-image snapshots
Apart from screenshots, you can use expect(value).toMatchSnapshot(snapshotName) to compare text or arbitrary binary data. Playwright Test auto-detects the content type and uses the appropriate comparison algorithm.
Here we compare text content against the reference.
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
 expect(await page.textContent('.hero__title')).toMatchSnapshot('hero.txt');
});
Snapshots are stored next to the test file, in a separate directory. For example, my.spec.ts file will produce and store snapshots in the my.spec.ts-snapshots directory. You should commit this directory to your version control (e.g. git), and review any changes to it.

WebView2
Introduction
The following will explain how to use Playwright with Microsoft Edge WebView2. WebView2 is a WinForms control, which will use Microsoft Edge under the hood to render web content. It is a part of the Microsoft Edge browser and is available on Windows 10 and Windows 11. Playwright can be used to automate WebView2 applications and can be used to test web content in WebView2. For connecting to WebView2, Playwright uses browserType.connectOverCDP() which connects to it via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).
Overview
A WebView2 control can be instructed to listen to incoming CDP connections by setting either the WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS environment variable with --remote-debugging-port=9222 or calling EnsureCoreWebView2Async with the --remote-debugging-port=9222 argument. This will start the WebView2 process with the Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled which allows the automation by Playwright. 9222 is an example port in this case, but any other unused port can be used as well.
await this.webView.EnsureCoreWebView2Async(await CoreWebView2Environment.CreateAsync(null, null, new CoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions()
{
 AdditionalBrowserArguments = "--remote-debugging-port=9222",
})).ConfigureAwait(false);
Once your application with the WebView2 control is running, you can connect to it via Playwright:
const browser = await playwright.chromium.connectOverCDP('http://localhost:9222');
const context = browser.contexts()[0];
const page = context.pages()[0];
To ensure that the WebView2 control is ready, you can wait for the CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted event:
this.webView.CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted += (_, e) =>
{
   if (e.IsSuccess)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("WebView2 initialized");
   }
};
Writing and running tests
By default, the WebView2 control will use the same user data directory for all instances. This means that if you run multiple tests in parallel, they will interfere with each other. To avoid this, you should set the WEBVIEW2_USER_DATA_FOLDER environment variable (or use WebView2.EnsureCoreWebView2Async Method) to a different folder for each test. This will make sure that each test runs in its own user data directory.
Using the following, Playwright will run your WebView2 application as a sub-process, assign a unique user data directory to it and provide the Page instance to your test:
webView2Test.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import fs from 'fs';
import os from 'os';
import path from 'path';
import childProcess from 'child_process';

const EXECUTABLE_PATH = path.join(
   __dirname,
   '../../webview2-app/bin/Debug/net8.0-windows/webview2.exe',
);

export const test = base.extend({
 browser: async ({ playwright }, use, testInfo) => {
   const cdpPort = 10000 + testInfo.workerIndex;
   // Make sure that the executable exists and is executable
   fs.accessSync(EXECUTABLE_PATH, fs.constants.X_OK);
   const userDataDir = path.join(
       fs.realpathSync.native(os.tmpdir()),
       `playwright-webview2-tests/user-data-dir-${testInfo.workerIndex}`,
   );
   const webView2Process = childProcess.spawn(EXECUTABLE_PATH, [], {
     shell: true,
     env: {
       ...process.env,
       WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS: `--remote-debugging-port=${cdpPort}`,
       WEBVIEW2_USER_DATA_FOLDER: userDataDir,
     }
   });
   await new Promise<void>(resolve => webView2Process.stdout.on('data', data => {
     if (data.toString().includes('WebView2 initialized'))
       resolve();
   }));
   const browser = await playwright.chromium.connectOverCDP(`http://127.0.0.1:${cdpPort}`);
   await use(browser);
   await browser.close();
   childProcess.execSync(`taskkill /pid ${webView2Process.pid} /T /F`);
   fs.rmdirSync(userDataDir, { recursive: true });
 },
 context: async ({ browser }, use) => {
   const context = browser.contexts()[0];
   await use(context);
 },
 page: async ({ context }, use) => {
   const page = context.pages()[0];
   await use(page);
 },
});

export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from './webView2Test';

test('test WebView2', async ({ page }) => {
 await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
 const getStarted = page.getByText('Get Started');
 await expect(getStarted).toBeVisible();
});
Debugging
Inside your webview2 control, you can just right-click to open the context menu and select "Inspect" to open the DevTools or press F12. You can also use the WebView2.CoreWebView2.OpenDevToolsWindow method to open the DevTools programmatically.
For debugging tests, see the Playwright Debugging guide.

Docker
Introduction
Dockerfile.noble can be used to run Playwright scripts in Docker environment. This image includes the Playwright browsers and browser system dependencies. The Playwright package/dependency is not included in the image and should be installed separately.
Usage
This Docker image is published to Microsoft Artifact Registry.
INFO
This Docker image is intended to be used for testing and development purposes only. It is not recommended to use this Docker image to visit untrusted websites.
Pull the image
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble
Run the image
By default, the Docker image will use the root user to run the browsers. This will disable the Chromium sandbox which is not available with root. If you run trusted code (e.g. End-to-end tests) and want to avoid the hassle of managing separate user then the root user may be fine. For web scraping or crawling, we recommend to create a separate user inside the Docker container and use the seccomp profile.
End-to-end tests
On trusted websites, you can avoid creating a separate user and use root for it since you trust the code which will run on the browsers.
docker run -it --rm --ipc=host mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble /bin/bash
Crawling and scraping
On untrusted websites, it's recommended to use a separate user for launching the browsers in combination with the seccomp profile. Inside the container or if you are using the Docker image as a base image you have to use adduser for it.
docker run -it --rm --ipc=host --user pwuser --security-opt seccomp=seccomp_profile.json mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble /bin/bash
seccomp_profile.json is needed to run Chromium with sandbox. This is a default Docker seccomp profile with extra user namespace cloning permissions:
{
 "comment": "Allow create user namespaces",
 "names": [
   "clone",
   "setns",
   "unshare"
 ],
 "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
 "args": [],
 "includes": {},
 "excludes": {}
}
Recommended Docker Configuration
When running Playwright in Docker, the following configuration is recommended:
Using --init Docker flag is recommended to avoid special treatment for processes with PID=1. This is a common reason for zombie processes.
Using --ipc=host is recommended when using Chromium. Without it, Chromium can run out of memory and crash. Learn more about this option in Docker docs.
If seeing weird errors when launching Chromium, try running your container with docker run --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN when developing locally.
Using on CI
See our Continuous Integration guides for sample configs.
Remote Connection
You can run Playwright Server in Docker while keeping your tests running on the host system or another machine. This is useful for running tests on unsupported Linux distributions or remote execution scenarios.
Running the Playwright Server
Start the Playwright Server in Docker:
docker run -p 3000:3000 --rm --init -it --workdir /home/pwuser --user pwuser mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble /bin/sh -c "npx -y playwright@1.54.0 run-server --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0"
Connecting to the Server
There are two ways to connect to the remote Playwright server:
Using environment variable with @playwright/test:
PW_TEST_CONNECT_WS_ENDPOINT=ws://127.0.0.1:3000/ npx playwright test
Using the browserType.connect() API for other applications:
const browser = await playwright['chromium'].connect('ws://127.0.0.1:3000/');
Network Configuration
If you need to access local servers from within the Docker container:
docker run --add-host=hostmachine:host-gateway -p 3000:3000 --rm --init -it --workdir /home/pwuser --user pwuser mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble /bin/sh -c "npx -y playwright@1.54.0 run-server --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0"
This makes hostmachine point to the host's localhost. Your tests should use hostmachine instead of localhost when accessing local servers.
NOTE
When running tests remotely, ensure the Playwright version in your tests matches the version running in the Docker container.
Image tags
See all available image tags.
We currently publish images with the following tags:
:v1.54.0 - Playwright v1.54.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat).
:v1.54.0-noble - Playwright v1.54.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat).
:v1.54.0-jammy - Playwright v1.54.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish).
NOTE
It is recommended to always pin your Docker image to a specific version if possible. If the Playwright version in your Docker image does not match the version in your project/tests, Playwright will be unable to locate browser executables.
Base images
We currently publish images based on the following Ubuntu versions:
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat), image tags include noble
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish), image tags include jammy
Alpine
Browser builds for Firefox and WebKit are built for the glibc library. Alpine Linux and other distributions that are based on the musl standard library are not supported.
Build your own image
To run Playwright inside Docker, you need to have Node.js, Playwright browsers and browser system dependencies installed. See the following Dockerfile:
FROM node:20-bookworm

RUN npx -y playwright@1.54.0 install --with-deps

Continuous Integration
Introduction
Playwright tests can be executed in CI environments. We have created sample configurations for common CI providers.
3 steps to get your tests running on CI:
Ensure CI agent can run browsers: Use our Docker image in Linux agents or install your dependencies using the CLI.
Install Playwright:
# Install NPM packages
npm ci

# Install Playwright browsers and dependencies
npx playwright install --with-deps


Run your tests:
npx playwright test
Workers
We recommend setting workers to "1" in CI environments to prioritize stability and reproducibility. Running tests sequentially ensures each test gets the full system resources, avoiding potential conflicts. However, if you have a powerful self-hosted CI system, you may enable parallel tests. For wider parallelization, consider sharding - distributing tests across multiple CI jobs.
playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 // Opt out of parallel tests on CI.
 workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
});
CI configurations
The Command line tools can be used to install all operating system dependencies in CI.
GitHub Actions
On push/pull_request
Tests will run on push or pull request on branches main/master. The workflow will install all dependencies, install Playwright and then run the tests. It will also create the HTML report.
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
 push:
   branches: [ main, master ]
 pull_request:
   branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
 test:
   timeout-minutes: 60
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
   - uses: actions/checkout@v4
   - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
     with:
       node-version: lts/*
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: npm ci
   - name: Install Playwright Browsers
     run: npx playwright install --with-deps
   - name: Run Playwright tests
     run: npx playwright test
   - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
     if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
     with:
       name: playwright-report
       path: playwright-report/
       retention-days: 30
On push/pull_request (sharded)
GitHub Actions supports sharding tests between multiple jobs. Check out our sharding doc to learn more about sharding and to see a GitHub actions example of how to configure a job to run your tests on multiple machines as well as how to merge the HTML reports.
Via Containers
GitHub Actions support running jobs in a container by using the jobs.<job_id>.container option. This is useful to not pollute the host environment with dependencies and to have a consistent environment for e.g. screenshots/visual regression testing across different operating systems.
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
 push:
   branches: [ main, master ]
 pull_request:
   branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
 playwright:
   name: 'Playwright Tests'
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   container:
     image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble
     options: --user 1001
   steps:
     - uses: actions/checkout@v4
     - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
       with:
         node-version: lts/*
     - name: Install dependencies
       run: npm ci
     - name: Run your tests
       run: npx playwright test
On deployment
This will start the tests after a GitHub Deployment went into the success state. Services like Vercel use this pattern so you can run your end-to-end tests on their deployed environment.
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
 deployment_status:
jobs:
 test:
   timeout-minutes: 60
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
   steps:
   - uses: actions/checkout@v4
   - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
     with:
       node-version: lts/*
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: npm ci
   - name: Install Playwright
     run: npx playwright install --with-deps
   - name: Run Playwright tests
     run: npx playwright test
     env:
       PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_BASE_URL: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}
Fail-Fast
Large test suites can take very long to execute. By executing a preliminary test run with the --only-changed flag, you can run test files that are likely to fail first. This will give you a faster feedback loop and slightly lower CI consumption while working on Pull Requests. To detect test files affected by your changeset, --only-changed analyses your suites' dependency graph. This is a heuristic and might miss tests, so it's important that you always run the full test suite after the preliminary test run.
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
 push:
   branches: [ main, master ]
 pull_request:
   branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
 test:
   timeout-minutes: 60
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
   - uses: actions/checkout@v4
     with:
       # Force a non-shallow checkout, so that we can reference $GITHUB_BASE_REF.
       # See https://github.com/actions/checkout for more details.
       fetch-depth: 0
   - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
     with:
       node-version: lts/*
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: npm ci
   - name: Install Playwright Browsers
     run: npx playwright install --with-deps
   - name: Run changed Playwright tests
     run: npx playwright test --only-changed=$GITHUB_BASE_REF
     if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
   - name: Run Playwright tests
     run: npx playwright test
   - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
     if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
     with:
       name: playwright-report
       path: playwright-report/
       retention-days: 30
Docker
We have a pre-built Docker image which can either be used directly or as a reference to update your existing Docker definitions. Make sure to follow the Recommended Docker Configuration to ensure the best performance.
Azure Pipelines
For Windows or macOS agents, no additional configuration is required, just install Playwright and run your tests.
For Linux agents, you can use our Docker container with Azure Pipelines support running containerized jobs. Alternatively, you can use Command line tools to install all necessary dependencies.
For running the Playwright tests use this pipeline task:
trigger:
- main

pool:
 vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
 inputs:
   versionSpec: '18'
 displayName: 'Install Node.js'
- script: npm ci
 displayName: 'npm ci'
- script: npx playwright install --with-deps
 displayName: 'Install Playwright browsers'
- script: npx playwright test
 displayName: 'Run Playwright tests'
 env:
   CI: 'true'
Uploading playwright-report folder with Azure Pipelines
This will make the pipeline run fail if any of the playwright tests fails. If you also want to integrate the test results with Azure DevOps, use the task PublishTestResults task like so:
trigger:
- main

pool:
 vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
 inputs:
   versionSpec: '18'
 displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: npm ci
 displayName: 'npm ci'
- script: npx playwright install --with-deps
 displayName: 'Install Playwright browsers'
- script: npx playwright test
 displayName: 'Run Playwright tests'
 env:
   CI: 'true'
- task: PublishTestResults@2
 displayName: 'Publish test results'
 inputs:
   searchFolder: 'test-results'
   testResultsFormat: 'JUnit'
   testResultsFiles: 'e2e-junit-results.xml'
   mergeTestResults: true
   failTaskOnFailedTests: true
   testRunTitle: 'My End-To-End Tests'
 condition: succeededOrFailed()
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
 inputs:
   targetPath: playwright-report
   artifact: playwright-report
   publishLocation: 'pipeline'
 condition: succeededOrFailed()

Note: The JUnit reporter needs to be configured accordingly via
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
 reporter: [['junit', { outputFile: 'test-results/e2e-junit-results.xml' }]],
});
in playwright.config.ts.

CircleCI
Running Playwright on CircleCI is very similar to running on GitHub Actions. In order to specify the pre-built Playwright Docker image, simply modify the agent definition with docker: in your config like so:
executors:
 pw-noble-development:
   docker:
     - image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble
Note: When using the docker agent definition, you are specifying the resource class of where playwright runs to the 'medium' tier here. The default behavior of Playwright is to set the number of workers to the detected core count (2 in the case of the medium tier). Overriding the number of workers to greater than this number will cause unnecessary timeouts and failures.
Sharding in CircleCI
Sharding in CircleCI is indexed with 0 which means that you will need to override the default parallelism ENV VARS. The following example demonstrates how to run Playwright with a CircleCI Parallelism of 4 by adding 1 to the CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX to pass into the --shard cli arg.
 playwright-job-name:
   executor: pw-noble-development
   parallelism: 4
   steps:
     - run: SHARD="$((${CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX}+1))"; npx playwright test --shard=${SHARD}/${CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL}
Jenkins
Jenkins supports Docker agents for pipelines. Use the Playwright Docker image to run tests on Jenkins.
pipeline {
  agent { docker { image 'mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble' } }
  stages {
     stage('e2e-tests') {
        steps {
           sh 'npm ci'
           sh 'npx playwright test'
        }
     }
  }
}
Bitbucket Pipelines
Bitbucket Pipelines can use public Docker images as build environments. To run Playwright tests on Bitbucket, use our public Docker image (see Dockerfile).
image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble
GitLab CI
To run Playwright tests on GitLab, use our public Docker image (see Dockerfile).
stages:
 - test

tests:
 stage: test
 image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble
 script:
 ...
Sharding
GitLab CI supports sharding tests between multiple jobs using the parallel keyword. The test job will be split into multiple smaller jobs that run in parallel. Parallel jobs are named sequentially from job_name 1/N to job_name N/N.
stages:
 - test

tests:
 stage: test
 image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble
 parallel: 7
 script:
   - npm ci
   - npx playwright test --shard=$CI_NODE_INDEX/$CI_NODE_TOTAL
GitLab CI also supports sharding tests between multiple jobs using the parallel:matrix option. The test job will run multiple times in parallel in a single pipeline, but with different variable values for each instance of the job. In the example below, we have 2 PROJECT values and 10 SHARD values, resulting in a total of 20 jobs to be run.
stages:
 - test

tests:
 stage: test
 image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble
 parallel:
   matrix:
     - PROJECT: ['chromium', 'webkit']
       SHARD: ['1/10', '2/10', '3/10', '4/10', '5/10', '6/10', '7/10', '8/10', '9/10', '10/10']
 script:
   - npm ci
   - npx playwright test --project=$PROJECT --shard=$SHARD
Google Cloud Build
To run Playwright tests on Google Cloud Build, use our public Docker image (see Dockerfile).
steps:
- name: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble
 script:
 ...
 env:
 - 'CI=true'
Drone
To run Playwright tests on Drone, use our public Docker image (see Dockerfile).
kind: pipeline
name: default
type: docker

steps:
 - name: test
   image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.0-noble
   commands:
     - npx playwright test
Caching browsers
Caching browser binaries is not recommended, since the amount of time it takes to restore the cache is comparable to the time it takes to download the binaries. Especially under Linux, operating system dependencies need to be installed, which are not cacheable.
If you still want to cache the browser binaries between CI runs, cache these directories in your CI configuration, against a hash of the Playwright version.
Debugging browser launches
Playwright supports the DEBUG environment variable to output debug logs during execution. Setting it to pw:browser is helpful while debugging Error: Failed to launch browser errors.
DEBUG=pw:browser npx playwright test
Running headed
By default, Playwright launches browsers in headless mode. See in our Running tests guide how to run tests in headed mode.
On Linux agents, headed execution requires Xvfb to be installed. Our Docker image and GitHub Action have Xvfb pre-installed. To run browsers in headed mode with Xvfb, add xvfb-run before the actual command.
xvfb-run npx playwright test

Migrating from Testing Library
Migration principles
This guide describes migration to Playwright's Experimental Component Testing from DOM Testing Library, React Testing Library, Vue Testing Library and Svelte Testing Library.
NOTE
If you use DOM Testing Library in the browser (for example, you bundle end-to-end tests with webpack), you can switch directly to Playwright Test. Examples below are focused on component tests, but for end-to-end test you just need to replace await mount with await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/') to open the page under test.
Cheat Sheet

screen
page and component
queries

assertions
user events
actions
await user.click(screen.getByText('Click me'))
await component.getByText('Click me').click()
await user.click(await screen.findByText('Click me'))
await component.getByText('Click me').click()
await user.type(screen.getByLabelText('Password'), 'secret')
await component.getByLabel('Password').fill('secret')
expect(screen.getByLabelText('Password')).toHaveValue('secret')
await expect(component.getByLabel('Password')).toHaveValue('secret')
screen.getByRole('button', { pressed: true })
component.getByRole('button', { pressed: true })
screen.getByLabelText('...')
component.getByLabel('...')
screen.queryByPlaceholderText('...')
component.getByPlaceholder('...')
screen.findByText('...')
component.getByText('...')
screen.getByTestId('...')
component.getByTestId('...')
render(<Component />);
mount(<Component />);
const { unmount } = render(<Component />);
const { unmount } = await mount(<Component />);
const { rerender } = render(<Component />);
const { update } = await mount(<Component />);

Example
Testing Library:
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

test('sign in', async () => {
 // Setup the page.
 const user = userEvent.setup();
 render(<SignInPage />);

 // Perform actions.
 await user.type(screen.getByLabelText('Username'), 'John');
 await user.type(screen.getByLabelText('Password'), 'secret');
 await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }));

 // Verify signed in state by waiting until "Welcome" message appears.
 expect(await screen.findByText('Welcome, John')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
Line-by-line migration to Playwright Test:
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/experimental-ct-react'); // 1

test('sign in', async ({ mount }) => { // 2
 // Setup the page.
 const component = await mount(<SignInPage />); // 3

 // Perform actions.
 await component.getByLabel('Username').fill('John'); // 4
 await component.getByLabel('Password').fill('secret');
 await component.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();

 // Verify signed in state by waiting until "Welcome" message appears.
 await expect(component.getByText('Welcome, John')).toBeVisible(); // 5
});
Migration highlights (see inline comments in the Playwright Test code snippet):
Import everything from @playwright/experimental-ct-react (or -vue, -svelte) for component tests, or from @playwright/test for end-to-end tests.
Test function is given a page that is isolated from other tests, and mount that renders a component in this page. These are two of the useful fixtures in Playwright Test.
Replace render with mount that returns a component locator.
Use locators created with locator.locator() or page.locator() to perform most of the actions.
Use assertions to verify the state.
Migrating queries
All queries like getBy..., findBy..., queryBy... and their multi-element counterparts are replaced with component.getBy... locators. Locators always auto-wait and retry when needed, so you don't have to worry about choosing the right method. When you want to do a list operation, e.g. assert a list of texts, Playwright automatically performs multi-element operations.
Replacing waitFor
Playwright includes assertions that automatically wait for the condition, so you don't usually need an explicit waitFor/waitForElementToBeRemoved call.
// Testing Library
await waitFor(() => {
 expect(getByText('the lion king')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => queryByText('the mummy'));

// Playwright
await expect(page.getByText('the lion king')).toBeVisible();
await expect(page.getByText('the mummy')).toBeHidden();
When you cannot find a suitable assertion, use expect.poll instead.
await expect.poll(async () => {
 const response = await page.request.get('https://api.example.com');
 return response.status();
}).toBe(200);
Replacing within
You can create a locator inside another locator with locator.locator() method.
// Testing Library
const messages = document.getElementById('messages');
const helloMessage = within(messages).getByText('hello');

// Playwright
const messages = component.getByTestId('messages');
const helloMessage = messages.getByText('hello');

CDPSession
The CDPSession instances are used to talk raw Chrome Devtools Protocol:
protocol methods can be called with session.send method.
protocol events can be subscribed to with session.on method.
Useful links:
Documentation on DevTools Protocol can be found here: DevTools Protocol Viewer.
Getting Started with DevTools Protocol: https://github.com/aslushnikov/getting-started-with-cdp/blob/master/README.md
const client = await page.context().newCDPSession(page);
await client.send('Animation.enable');
client.on('Animation.animationCreated', () => console.log('Animation created!'));
const response = await client.send('Animation.getPlaybackRate');
console.log('playback rate is ' + response.playbackRate);
await client.send('Animation.setPlaybackRate', {
 playbackRate: response.playbackRate / 2
});

Methods
detach
Added before v1.9 
Detaches the CDPSession from the target. Once detached, the CDPSession object won't emit any events and can't be used to send messages.
Usage
await cdpSession.detach();
Returns
Promise<void>#

send
Added before v1.9 
Usage
await cdpSession.send(method);
await cdpSession.send(method, params);
Arguments
method string#
Protocol method name.
params Object (optional)#
Optional method parameters.
Returns
Promise<Object>#
