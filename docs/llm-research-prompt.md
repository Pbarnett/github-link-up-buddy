# LLM Research Prompt: Creating a Flawless Development Plan

## Objective

Develop a comprehensive, systematic, and proven development plan to flawlessly implement new features in an existing application. The focus is on ensuring quality, consistency, and efficiency in every phase of development.

## Instructions

1. **Research Best Practices**
    - Investigate the latest industry standards and frameworks for planning and executing software development projects.
    - Identify methodologies (e.g., Agile, Scrum, Kanban) that align with project goals.
    
2. **Evaluate Successful Case Studies**
    - Look into real-world examples of successful project implementations in similar domains.
    - Analyze the strategies that led to flawless executions.

3. **Tools and Technologies**
    - Explore the tools and technologies that assist in maintaining code quality and consistency (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, testing frameworks).

4. **Risk Management and Mitigation**
    - Research strategies for identifying potential risks and implementing mitigation measures.

5. **Feedback and Iteration**
    - Review existing literature on incorporating user feedback into the development cycle and adapting based on performance metrics.

6. **Documentation and Training**
    - Outline best practices for documentation and training sessions to ensure everyone on the team remains informed and aligned.

## Desired Outcome

The research should culminate in a comprehensive report detailing actionable insights and strategies that can be directly applied to the Parker Flight project. The focus should be on creating a development plan that is robust, efficient, and capable of being executed flawlessly within the given constraints.
