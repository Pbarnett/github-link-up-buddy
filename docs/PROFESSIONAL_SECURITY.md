npm run credentials:pro:report

# Run comprehensive security audit
npm run security:audit

# Check audit logs
npm run credentials:pro:audit
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🔐 Enterprise Security
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Military-grade encryption for credentials at rest
- **Tamper Detection**: Checksums and integrity verification
- **Secure Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Master Key Management**: Cryptographically secure random keys

### 📊 Compliance Ready
- **SOX Compliance**: Sarbanes-Oxley audit requirements
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry security standards  
- **HIPAA Ready**: Healthcare data protection controls
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all credential access

### 🔄 Advanced Management
- **Automated Rotation**: Scheduled credential rotation

## 📋 Security Audit System

### Comprehensive Scanning
```bash
# Full security audit with console output
npm run security:audit

# Generate JSON report
npm run security:audit:json

# Save detailed report to file
npm run security:audit:report
```

### What Gets Audited
- ✅ File permission analysis
- ✅ Git history scanning for exposed secrets
- ✅ Source code security analysis
- ✅ Configuration security review
- ✅ Compliance checks (SOX, PCI, HIPAA)
- ✅ Environment variable exposure detection

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- Use the professional setup for production environments
- Run security audits regularly (`npm run security:audit`)
- Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity
- Keep master keys secure and backed up
- Rotate credentials on schedule
- Use test keys only for development

### Don'ts ❌
- Never commit the `.security/` directory
- Don't share master keys or vault files
- Never use live credentials in development
- Don't skip security audits
- Avoid manual credential management in production

## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

### Credential Compromise
```bash
# Immediate lockdown
npm run credentials:pro lockdown "Security incident detected"

# Rotate all affected credentials
npm run credentials:pro:setup  # Re-run setup with new credentials
```

### Security Audit Failures
```bash
# Generate detailed report
npm run security:audit:report > security-incident-$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Review critical issues first
npm run security:audit | grep "CRITICAL"
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Master key not initialized"**
```bash
npm run credentials:pro:init
```

**"Credential integrity check failed"**
- Possible tampering detected
- Re-run setup to restore from backup
- Check audit logs for suspicious activity

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Ensure proper file permissions: `chmod 600 .env.test.local`
- Verify `.security/` directory exists and is accessible

### Getting Help
1. Check this documentation first
2. Review audit logs: `npm run credentials:pro:audit`
