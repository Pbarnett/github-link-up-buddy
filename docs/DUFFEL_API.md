Offer Requests
To search for flights, you'll need to create an offer request. An offer request describes the passengers and where and when they want to travel (in the form of a list of slices). It may also include additional filters (e.g. a particular cabin to travel in).

Schema
cabin_class
enum
nullable
The cabin that the passengers want to travel in

Possible values: "first", "business", "premium_economy", or "economy"
client_key
string
A client key to allow the Duffel Ancillaries component to talk to the Duffel API to retrieve information about an offer and its ancillaries. Learn more about how to use this on https://duffel.com/docs/guides/ancillaries-component.

Example: "SFMyNTY.g2gDdAAAAANkAAlsaXZlX21vZGVkAAVmYWxzZWQAD29yZ2FuaXNhdGlvbl9pZG0AAAAab3JnXzAwMDA5VWhGY29ERGk5TTFTRjhiS2FkAAtyZXNvdXJjZV9pZG0AAAAab3JxXzAwMDBBVkZWZnFJUXFBWXpYeVRRVlVuBgDpOCvdhwFiAAFRgA.df1RmLeBFUR7r1WFHHiEksilfSZNLhmPX0nj5VOKWJ4"
created_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the offer request was created

Example: "2020-02-12T15:21:01.927Z"
id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "orq_00009hjdomFOCJyxHG7k7k"
live_mode
boolean
Whether the offer request was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the offer request was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: false

offers
list
The offers returned by the airlines

offers.base_amount
string
The base price of the offer for all passengers, excluding taxes. It does not include the base amount of any service(s) that might be booked with the offer.

Example: "30.20"
offers.base_currency
string
The currency of the base_amount, as an ISO 4217 currency code. It will match your organisation's billing currency unless youâ€™re using Duffel as an accredited IATA agent, in which case it will be in the currency provided by the airline (which will usually be based on the country where your IATA agency is registered).

Example: "GBP"

offers.conditions
object
The conditions associated with this offer, describing the kinds of modifications you can make post-booking and any penalties that will apply to those modifications. This information assumes the condition is applied to all of the slices and passengers associated with this offer - for information at the slice level (e.g. "what happens if I just want to change the first slice?") refer to the slices. If a particular kind of modification is allowed, you may not always be able to take action through the Duffel API. In some cases, you may need to contact the Duffel support team or the airline directly.


offers.conditions.change_before_departure
object
nullable
Whether the whole offer can be changed before the departure of the first slice. If all of the slices on the offer can be changed then the allowed property will be true. Refer to the slices for information about change penalties. If any of the slices on the offer can't be changed then the allowed property will be false. In this case you should refer to the slices conditions to determine if any part of the offer is changeable. If the airline hasn't provided any information about whether this offer can be changed then this property will be null.

offers.conditions.change_before_departure.allowed
boolean
Whether this kind of modification is allowed post-booking

Example: true
offers.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_amount
string
nullable
If the modification is allowed then this is the amount payable to apply the modification to all passengers. If there is no penalty, the value will be zero. If the modification isn't allowed or the penalty is not known then this field will be null. If this is null then the penalty_currency will also be null.

Example: "100.00"
offers.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the penalty_amount as an ISO 4217 currency code. This will be in a currency determined by the airline, which is not necessarily the same as the currency of the offer or order. If this is null then penalty_amount will also be null.

Example: "GBP"

offers.conditions.refund_before_departure
object
nullable
Whether the whole offer can be refunded before the departure of the first slice. If all of the slices on the offer can be refunded then the allowed property will be true and information will be provided about any penalties. If any of the slices on the offer can't be refunded then the allowed property will be false. If the airline hasn't provided any information about whether this offer can be refunded then this property will be null.

offers.conditions.refund_before_departure.allowed
boolean
Whether this kind of modification is allowed post-booking

Example: true
offers.conditions.refund_before_departure.penalty_amount
string
nullable
If the modification is allowed then this is the amount payable to apply the modification to all passengers. If there is no penalty, the value will be zero. If the modification isn't allowed or the penalty is not known then this field will be null. If this is null then the penalty_currency will also be null.

Example: "100.00"
offers.conditions.refund_before_departure.penalty_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the penalty_amount as an ISO 4217 currency code. This will be in a currency determined by the airline, which is not necessarily the same as the currency of the offer or order. If this is null then penalty_amount will also be null.

Example: "GBP"
offers.created_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the offer was created

Example: "2020-01-17T10:12:14.545Z"
offers.expires_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime expiry of the offer before which the traveller should use this offer to create an order. After this time the offer can no longer be used to create an order.

Example: "2020-01-17T10:42:14.545Z"
offers.id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "off_00009htYpSCXrwaB9DnUm0"
offers.live_mode
boolean
Whether the offer request was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the offer request was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: true

offers.owner
object
The airline which provided the offer

offers.owner.conditions_of_carriage_url
string
nullable
URL to the airline's conditions of carriage.

Example: "https://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/legal/british-airways/general-conditions-of-carriage"
offers.owner.iata_code
string
nullable
The two-character IATA code for the airline. This may be null for non-IATA carriers.

Example: "arl_00001876aqC8c5umZmrRds"
offers.owner.logo_lockup_url
string
nullable
Path to a svg of the airline lockup logo. A lockup logo is also called a combination logo, in which it combines the logotype and logomark. This may be null if no logo is available.

Example: "https://assets.duffel.com/img/airlines/for-light-background/full-color-lockup/BA.svg"
offers.owner.logo_symbol_url
string
nullable
Path to a svg of the airline logo. This may be null if no logo is available.

Example: "https://assets.duffel.com/img/airlines/for-light-background/full-color-logo/BA.svg"
offers.owner.name
string
The name of the airline

Example: "British Airways"
offers.partial
boolean
Partial offers are a new concept we're introducing as a part of a new multi-step search flow that we're currently experimenting with. A partial offer can't be booked directly, but it can be combined with other partial offers to form a full offer. Partial offers are only ever returned through the multi-step search flow. So there's no need to add any handling to deal with partial offers if you're using the traditional OfferRequest search flow to create offers.

Example: true
offers.passenger_identity_documents_required
boolean
Whether identity documents must be provided for each of the passengers when creating an order based on this offer. If this is true, you must provide a passport document for every passenger.

Example: false

Possible values: "adult", "child", or "infant_without_seat"

offers.payment_requirements
object
The payment requirements for this offer

offers.payment_requirements.payment_required_by
datetime
nullable
The ISO 8601 datetime by which you must pay for this offer. At this time, if still unpaid, the reserved space on the flight(s) will be released and you will have to create a new order. This will be null when the offer requires immediate payment - that is, when requires_instant_payment is true.

Example: "2020-01-17T10:42:14Z"
offers.payment_requirements.price_guarantee_expires_at
datetime
nullable
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the price associated with the order will no longer be guaranteed by the airline and may change before payment. This will be null when requires_instant_payment is true.

Example: "2020-01-17T10:42:14Z"
offers.payment_requirements.requires_instant_payment
boolean
When payment is required at the time of booking this will be true and payment_required_by and price_guarantee_expires_at will be null. When payment can be made at a time after booking, this will be false and the time limits on the payment will be provided in payment_required_by and price_guarantee_expires_at.

Example: false

Possible values: "corporate", "leisure", or "negotiated"

offers.slices
list
The slices that make up this offer. Each slice will include one or more segments, the specific flights that the airline is offering to take the passengers from the slice's origin to its destination. Partial offers contain a single slice as each partial offer is for a particular slice of the journey.

offers.slices.comparison_key
string
A hash uniquely identifying this slice. This value could be use to group together identical slices from different offers.

Example: "BmlZDw=="

offers.slices.conditions
object
The conditions associated with this slice, describing the kinds of modifications you can make post-booking and any penalties that will apply to those modifications and also what perks will be available to passengers when travelling.

This condition is applied only to this slice and to all the passengers associated with this offer - for information at the offer level (e.g. "what happens if I want to change all the slices?") refer to the conditions at the top level.

If a particular kind of modification is allowed, you may not always be able to take action through the Duffel API. In some cases, you may need to contact the Duffel support team or the airline directly.

Note that the perks associated with the slice are aggregated across passengers and segments and are intended to provide a brief summary of the passenger experience, however the experience may not be consistent across all segments. As an example, priority boarding may be flagged as available on the slice but not available on all segments on the slice.

Note: advance_seat_selection, priority_boarding and priority_check_in are under restricted NGS feature. If you need access, get in touch with the Duffel support team.

offers.slices.conditions.advance_seat_selection
boolean
nullable
Whether passengers are able to select a seat prior to check in.

Example: "true"

offers.slices.conditions.change_before_departure
object
nullable
Whether this slice can be changed before the departure. If the slice can be changed for all of the passengers then the allowed property will be true and information will be provided about any penalties. If none of the passengers on the slice can be changed then the allowed property will be false. In all other cases this property will be null indicating we can't provide the information for this slice. The penalty_amount is specific to changing this slice and may not be the penalty that is applied if the entire offer is changed.

offers.slices.conditions.change_before_departure.allowed
boolean
Whether this kind of modification is allowed post-booking

Example: true
offers.slices.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_amount
string
nullable
If the modification is allowed then this is the amount payable to apply the modification to all passengers. If there is no penalty, the value will be zero. If the modification isn't allowed or the penalty is not known then this field will be null. If this is null then the penalty_currency will also be null.

Example: "100.00"
offers.slices.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the penalty_amount as an ISO 4217 currency code. This will be in a currency determined by the airline, which is not necessarily the same as the currency of the offer or order. If this is null then penalty_amount will also be null.

Create an offer request
To search for flights, you'll need to create an offer request. An offer request describes the passengers and where and when they want to travel (in the form of a list of slices). It may also include additional filters (e.g. a particular cabin to travel in).

We'll send your search to a range of airlines, and return your offer request back to you with a series of offers.

Each offer represents a set of flights you can buy from an airline at a particular price that meet your search criteria.

Inside the offers, you'll see your slices, but now each slice will also include a list of one or more specific flights (called segments) that the airline is offering to get the passengers where they want to go.

When presenting offers to your customers, you should always show the full name of the operating carrier of each segment (slices[].segments[].operating_carrier.name). This must be displayed prominently on the first screen where the offer is presented in order to comply with US regulations.

Query parameters
return_offers
boolean
When set to true, the offer request resource returned will include all the offers returned by the airlines. If set to false, the offer request resource won't include any offers. To retrieve the associated offers later, use the List Offers endpoint, specifying the offer_request_id. You should use this option if you want to take advantage of the pagination, sorting and filtering that the List Offers endpoint provides.

Example: false
Default value: true
supplier_timeout
integer
The maximum amount of time in milliseconds to wait for each airline search to complete. This timeout applies to the response time of the call to the airline and includes some additional overhead added by Duffel. Value should be between 2 seconds and 60 seconds. Any values outside the range will be ignored and the default supplier_timeout will be used. If a value is set, the response will only include offers from airline searches that completed within the given time. If a value is not set, the response will only include offers from airline searches that completed within the default supplier_timeout value of 20 seconds. We recommend setting supplier_timeout lower than the timeout on the HTTP request you send to Duffel API as that will allow us to respond with the offers we received before your request times out with an empty response.

Example: 10000
Default value: 20000
Body parameters
cabin_class
enum
nullable
The cabin that the passengers want to travel in

Possible values: "first", "business", "premium_economy", or "economy"
max_connections
integer
The maximum number of connections within any slice of the offer. For example 0 means a direct flight which will have a single segment within each slice and 1 means a maximum of two segments within each slice of the offer.

Example: 0
Default value: 1

passengers
list
required
The passengers who want to travel. If you specify an age for a passenger, the type may differ for the same passenger in different offers due to airline's different rules. e.g. one airline may treat a 14 year old as an adult, and another as a young adult. You may only specify an age or a type â€“ not both.

private_fares
The private fare codes for this offer request. You can pass in multiple airlines with their specific private fare codes. The key is the airline's IATA code that provided the private fare code. The corporate_code and tour_code are provided to you by the airline and the tracking_reference is to identify your business by the airlines.

Example: {"QF":[{"corporate_code":"FLX53","tracking_reference":"ABN:2345678"}],"UA":[{"corporate_code":"1234","tour_code":"578DFL"}]}

slices
list
required
The slices that make up this offer request. One-way journeys can be expressed using one slice, whereas return trips will need two.

Offers
After you've searched for flights by creating an offer request, we'll send your search to a range of airlines, which may return offers.

Each offer represents flights you can buy from an airline at a particular price that meet your search criteria.

You'll see slices inside the offers. Each slice will also include a list of one or more specific flights (called segments) that the airline is offering to get the passengers where they want to go.

An offer is only available to create an order for a limited time by the traveller before it expires, typically within 30 minutes. Exact time is indicated by the expires_at field.

So there's no need to add any handling to deal with partial offers if you're using the traditional OfferRequest search flow to create offers.

Get a single offer
You should use this API to get the complete, up-to-date information about an offer. This endpoint does not guarantee that the offer will be available at the time of booking.

Due to limitations in airlines' systems, you may see changes to the offer (e.g a changed total_amount). Additionally, you may receive information that may have not been included in the original offer such as baggage allowances.

Optionally, you can request information about additional available_services that you can book with this offer by specifying the return_available_services query parameter. Each time you make this API call there's a possibility that some of the service information will have changed, so you should always use data (e.g prices, service IDs) from the latest call to this endpoint when booking an offer.

List offers
Retrieves a list of offers for a given offer request specified by its ID. Unless you specify a sort parameter, the results may be returned in any order.

This endpoint does not return the complete, up-to-date information on each offer. The Get a single offer endpoint should be called for a given offer in order to get complete and up-to-date information.

Query parameters
after
string
A cursor pointing to the previous page of records. For more information on how to paginate through records, see the Pagination section.

Example: "g2wAAAACbQAAABBBZXJvbWlzdC1LaGFya2l2bQAAAB="
before
string
A cursor pointing to the next page of records. For more information on how to paginate through records, see the Pagination section.

Example: "g2wAAAACbQAAABBBZXJvbWlzdC1LaGFya2l2bQAAAB="
limit
integer
The maximum number of records to return per page. Defaults to 50. May be set to any integer between 1 and 200. For more information on how to paginate through records, see the Pagination section.

Example: 1
Default value: 50
offer_request_id
string
required
Duffel's unique identifier for the offer request, returned when it was created

Example: "orq_00009htyDGjIfajdNBZRlw"
sort
enum
By default, the offers will be returned sorted by ID in ascending order. This parameter allows you to sort the list of offers by total_amount or total_duration. By default the sorting order will be ascending, if you wish to sort in descending order a - will need to be prepended to the sorting attribute (i.e: -total_amount).

Possible values: "total_amount" or "total_duration"
max_connections
integer
Allows to filter the offers list by the maximum number of connections in a given offer. e.g. a return flight with three flights outbound and a direct inbound flight would be filtered out if max_connections=1 was passed.

Example: 0
Default value: 1

Offers
After you've searched for flights by creating an offer request, we'll send your search to a range of airlines, which may return offers.

Each offer represents flights you can buy from an airline at a particular price that meet your search criteria.

You'll see slices inside the offers. Each slice will also include a list of one or more specific flights (called segments) that the airline is offering to get the passengers where they want to go.

An offer is only available to create an order for a limited time by the traveller before it expires, typically within 30 minutes. Exact time is indicated by the expires_at field.

Get a single offer
You should use this API to get the complete, up-to-date information about an offer. This endpoint does not guarantee that the offer will be available at the time of booking.

Due to limitations in airlines' systems, you may see changes to the offer (e.g a changed total_amount). Additionally, you may receive information that may have not been included in the original offer such as baggage allowances.

Optionally, you can request information about additional available_services that you can book with this offer by specifying the return_available_services query parameter. Each time you make this API call there's a possibility that some of the service information will have changed, so you should always use data (e.g prices, service IDs) from the latest call to this endpoint when booking an offer.

List offers
Retrieves a list of offers for a given offer request specified by its ID. Unless you specify a sort parameter, the results may be returned in any order.

This endpoint does not return the complete, up-to-date information on each offer. The Get a single offer endpoint should be called for a given offer in order to get complete and up-to-date information.

Query parameters
after
string
A cursor pointing to the previous page of records. For more information on how to paginate through records, see the Pagination section.

Example: "g2wAAAACbQAAABBBZXJvbWlzdC1LaGFya2l2bQAAAB="
before
string
A cursor pointing to the next page of records. For more information on how to paginate through records, see the Pagination section.

Example: "g2wAAAACbQAAABBBZXJvbWlzdC1LaGFya2l2bQAAAB="
limit
integer
The maximum number of records to return per page. Defaults to 50. May be set to any integer between 1 and 200. For more information on how to paginate through records, see the Pagination section.

Example: 1
Default value: 50
offer_request_id
string
required
Duffel's unique identifier for the offer request, returned when it was created

Example: "orq_00009htyDGjIfajdNBZRlw"
sort
enum
By default, the offers will be returned sorted by ID in ascending order. This parameter allows you to sort the list of offers by total_amount or total_duration. By default the sorting order will be ascending, if you wish to sort in descending order a - will need to be prepended to the sorting attribute (i.e: -total_amount).

Possible values: "total_amount" or "total_duration"
max_connections
integer
Allows to filter the offers list by the maximum number of connections in a given offer. e.g. a return flight with three flights outbound and a direct inbound flight would be filtered out if max_connections=1 was passed.

Example: 0
Default value: 1

Payments
Payments for the various types of orders.

Schema
amount
string
The price of the payment

Example: "30.20"
created_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the payment was created

Example: "2020-04-11T15:48:11.642Z"
currency
string
nullable
The currency of the amount, as an ISO 4217 currency code. It will match your organisation's billing currency unless youâ€™re using Duffel as an accredited IATA agent, in which case it will be in the currency provided by the airline (which will usually be based on the country where your IATA agency is registered).

Example: "GBP"
id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "pay_00009hthhsUZ8W4LxQgkjo"
live_mode
boolean
Whether the payment was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the payment was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: false
type
enum
The type of payment applied to this order. If you are an IATA agent with your own agreements with airlines, in some cases, you can pay using ARC/BSP cash by specifying arc_bsp_cash. You can pay using your Duffel account's balance by specifying balance. In test mode, your balance is unlimited. Otherwise, you can pay by card. If you're not sure which of these options applies to you, get in touch with the Duffel support team at help@duffel.com.

Possible values: "arc_bsp_cash", "balance", or "card"
Create a payment
Creates a payment for a hold order. A hold order can be paid for up to the time limit indicated in payment_required_by, after which the space held for the order will be released and you will have to create a new order.

Before paying, you should always get the latest price by retrieving the order to minimise the risk that the price you have is different from the latest price.

If the price for an order has changed from the time of booking and you pass in the old price, then you will get a validation error on the amount field with a price_changed code. The price of an order should only change if the order has no price guarantee or the price guarantee has expired (ie. price_guaranteed_expires_at is null or in the past).

If you receive a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to create a payment for a hold order, it may have still been created on the airlineâ€™s side. Please contact Duffel support before trying the request again.

Validation errors
Field	Code	Description
order_id	order_type_not_eligible_for_payment	This order can't be paid for because it isn't a hold order.
amount	payment_amount_does_not_match_order_amount	The amount provided in the payment doesn't match the total_amount of the order.
currency	payment_currency_does_not_match_order_currency	The currency provided in the payment doesn't match the total_currency of the order.
Invalid states
This endpoint can return the following errors with a type of invalid_state, to indicate a reason that the order can't be paid for:

already_paid: The order youâ€™re paying for has already been paid for.

already_cancelled: The order youâ€™re attempting to pay for has been cancelled.

past_payment_required_by_date: The orderâ€™s payment_required_by date has elapsed.

schedule_changed: You can't pay for this order because it has been changed in some way on the airline's side. You should start again, creating a new order.

Body parameters
order_id
string
required
The id of the order you want to pay for.

Example: "ord_00003x8pVDGcS8y2AWCoWv"

payment
object
required
The payment details to use to pay for the order

}Seat Maps
Seat maps are used to build a rich experience for your customers so they can select a seat as part of an order.

A seat map includes the data for rendering seats in the relevant cabins, along with their total cost and other information such as disclosures.

A seat is a special kind of service in that they're not shown when getting an individual offer with return_available_services set to true. They're only available through this endpoint.

So far we support selecting seats when you create an order. This means we do not support selecting a seat after an order has already been created or cancelling a booked seat.

Display recommendations

Widths

Each seat, empty, and bassinet element should be displayed with the same static width, while other elements should ideally fill or shrink in the available space in the section. However, displaying them with a static width could also be appropriate.

If these elements don't fill the whole section, they should be displayed as middle-aligned by default.

Seat identifiers

We recommend showing seat letters on each seat, instead of creating a header row with letters for each column.

Seat maps themselves don't have columns per se.

There won't always be aligned columns of seats with the same letter in the seat map when seat rows have different numbers of seats.

For example, if there is one less seat in a row, the remaining seats may be shifted by half a seat and not aligning with any regular "column":

A B
 A
In addition, if there is less seats in a section, the letters of the window and aisle seats will always be preserved throughout the cabin. This can lead to the following seat map:

A B C
  A C
Schema

cabins
list
The list of cabins in this seat map.

Cabins are ordered by deck from lowest to highest, and then within each deck from the front to back of the aircraft.


A cabin is a physical section of an aircraft that passengers travel in. The cabin that a passenger travels in will depend on the fare they paid (for example an economy cabin versus a business class cabin).

cabins.aisles
integer
required
The number of aisles in this cabin.

If this is set to 1, each row of the cabin is split into two sections. If this is set to 2, each row of the cabin is split into three sections.

Example: 1

enum
required
The cabin class that the passenger will travel in on this segment

Possible values: "first", "business", "premium_economy", or "economy"

Get seat maps
Gets seat maps by specific parameters. At the moment we only support querying by an offer ID.

A list of seat maps, one per segment, will be returned, which you can use to build a seat selection UI for your customers. This is not available for all airlines or flights, so seat maps will not always be returned.

If there are one or more passengers, you do not have to select a seat for each one. Each passenger can only select one seat per segment. Two passengers cannot select the same seat.

As with other services when creating an order, the total amount charged will be the cost of the offer and any selected services.

Query parameters
offer_id
string
required

Order Cancellations
To cancel an order, you'll need to create an order cancellation. The order cancellation will contain details of the prospective cancellation such as the amount that will be refunded and where it will be refunded to.

Make sure that you are happy with the prospective cancellation. If you are happy, you can then go ahead and confirm the cancellation at which point the order will be cancelled and the refund will be applied.

The refund specified by refund_amount, if any, will be returned to your original payment method (e.g. your Duffel balance). You'll then need to refund your customer (e.g. back to their credit/debit card). You can only confirm the most recent order cancellation that you have created for an order.

Schema

airline_credits
list
The airline credits for this OrderCancellation


An order cancellation is used to cancel an order with an airline

airline_credits.credit_amount
string
required
The monetary value associated with this airline credit

Example: "90.80"
airline_credits.credit_code
string
required
The code which identifies the airline credit to the airline and will be used to redeem the airline credit

Example: "1234567890123"
airline_credits.credit_currency
string
required
The currency in which this airline credit is issued, as an ISO 4217 currency code

Example: "GBP"
airline_credits.credit_name
string
required
The human-readable name used by the airline to categorize the type of credit being offered. This name should help when trying to understand the airline's conditions of use which apply to this credit.

Example: "Duffel Travel Credit"
airline_credits.id
string
required
Duffel's unique identifier for the airline credit

Example: "act_00009qzZWzjDipIkqpaUAj"
airline_credits.issued_on
date
required
The date the credit was issued. It is important to note that this date might not be the same as the date of cancellation. Often airlines associate credits with tickets, in which case the date of issue is considered to be the date the ticket was originally issued. Airline credits may have expiration dates which are based on the date of issue. Airlines don't always reliably disclose the expiration date in their APIs at the time of cancellation, so we are unable to return this information on airline credits. To get the latest info on expiration dates for airline credits we recommend checking directly with the airlines to determine the specific conditions of use for the credit.

Example: "2023-02-24"
airline_credits.passenger_id
string
required
Duffel's unique identifier for the passenger on the order that the credit is associated with

Example: "pas_00009hj8USM7Ncg31cBCLL"
confirmed_at
datetime
nullable
The ISO 8601 datetime that indicates when the order cancellation was confirmed

Example: "2020-01-17T11:51:43.114803Z"
created_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the order cancellation was created

Example: "2020-04-11T15:48:11.642Z"
expires_at
datetime
nullable
The ISO 8601 datetime by which this cancellation must be confirmed

Example: "2020-01-17T10:42:14Z"
id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "ore_00009qzZWzjDipIkqpaUAj"
live_mode
boolean
Whether the order cancellation was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the order cancellation was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: false
order_id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "ord_00009hthhsUZ8W4LxQgkjo"
refund_amount
string
nullable
The amount that will be returned to the original payment method if the order is cancelled, determined according to the fare conditions. This may be 0.00 if the fare is non-refundable. It will include the refund amount of the flights and the services booked. This may be null in cases where the refund amount is unknown. This only applies in cases where we are unable to get a refund quote from the carrier.

Example: "90.80"
refund_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the refund_amount, as an ISO 4217 currency code. It will match your organisation's billing currency unless youâ€™re using Duffel as an accredited IATA agent, in which case it will be in the currency provided by the airline (which will usually be based on the country where your IATA agency is registered). For hold orders that are awaiting payment, the refund amount will always be 0.00.

Example: "GBP"
refund_to
enum
Where the refund, once confirmed, will be sent. awaiting_payment is for pay later orders where no payment has been made yet.

Possible values: "arc_bsp_cash", "balance", "card", "voucher", "awaiting_payment", or "airline_credits"

Confirm an order cancellation
Once you've created a pending order cancellation, you'll know the refund_amount you're due to get back.

To actually cancel the order, you'll need to confirm the cancellation. The booking with the airline will be cancelled, and the refund_amount will be returned to the original payment method (i.e. your Duffel balance). You'll then need to refund your customer (e.g. back to their credit/debit card). You can only confirm the most recent order cancellation that you have created.

datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the order change request was created

Example: "2020-01-17T10:12:14.545Z"
id
string
The ID of your order change request

Example: "ocr_0000A3bQP9RLVfNUcdpLpw"
live_mode
boolean
Whether the order was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the order was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: false

order_change_offers
list
The list of the offers available to perform change on the order.


An order change offer represents flights that can be used to replace a slice in an existing paid order

order_change_offers.change_total_amount
string
required
The amount that will be charged or returned to the original payment method if refunded, determined according to the fare conditions. This may be negative to reflect a refund.

Example: "90.80"
order_change_offers.change_total_currency

The currency of the change_total_amount, as an ISO 4217 currency code. It will match your organisation's billing currency unless youâ€™re using Duffel as an accredited IATA agent, in which case it will be in the currency provided by the airline (which will usually be based on the country where your IATA agency is registered).

Example: "GBP"

order_change_offers.conditions
object
required
The conditions associated with this offer, describing the kinds of modifications you can make post-booking and any penalties that will apply to those modifications. This information assumes the condition is applied to all of the slices and passengers associated with this offer - for information at the slice level (e.g. "what happens if I just want to change the first slice?") refer to the slices. If a particular kind of modification is allowed, you may not always be able to take action through the Duffel API. In some cases, you may need to contact the Duffel support team or the airline directly.


order_change_offers.conditions.change_before_departure
object
nullable
Whether the whole offer can be changed before the departure of the first slice. If all of the slices on the offer can be changed then the allowed property will be true. Refer to the slices for information about change penalties. If any of the slices on the offer can't be changed then the allowed property will be false. In this case you should refer to the slices conditions to determine if any part of the offer is changeable. If the airline hasn't provided any information about whether this offer can be changed then this property will be null.

order_change_offers.conditions.change_before_departure.allowed
boolean
Whether this kind of modification is allowed post-booking

Example: true
order_change_offers.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_amount
string
nullable
If the modification is allowed then this is the amount payable to apply the modification to all passengers. If there is no penalty, the value will be zero. If the modification isn't allowed or the penalty is not known then this field will be null. If this is null then the penalty_currency will also be null.

Example: "100.00"
order_change_offers.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the penalty_amount as an ISO 4217 currency code. This will be in a currency determined by the airline, which is not necessarily the same as the currency of the offer or order. If this is null then penalty_amount will also be null.

Example: "GBP"

order_change_offers.conditions.refund_before_departure
object
nullable
Whether the whole offer can be refunded before the departure of the first slice. If all of the slices on the offer can be refunded then the allowed property will be true and information will be provided about any penalties. If any of the slices on the offer can't be refunded then the allowed property will be false. If the airline hasn't provided any information about whether this offer can be refunded then this property will be null.

order_change_offers.conditions.refund_before_departure.allowed
boolean
Whether this kind of modification is allowed post-booking

Example: true
order_change_offers.conditions.refund_before_departure.penalty_amount

Example: "100.00"
order_change_offers.conditions.refund_before_departure.penalty_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the penalty_amount as an ISO 4217 currency code. This will be in a currency determined by the airline, which is not necessarily the same as the currency of the offer or order. If this is null then penalty_amount will also be null.

Create an order change request
To change flights on an existing paid order, you'll need to create an order change request. An order change request describes the slices you want to change and the details of where and when they want to travel (in the form of a list of slices). Any new slices will all need to use the same cabin class.

We'll send your search to the airline you originally booked with to search for order_change_offers. This list will be empty if no offers are available.

These can be viewed through the Get a single order change offer endpoint.

Each offer represents a set of flights you can buy from the airline to add to your order at a particular price that meet your search criteria.

Inside the offers, you'll see your slices, but now each slice will also include a list of one or more specific flights (called segments) that the airline is offering to get the passengers where they want to go.

When presenting offers to your customers, you should always show the full name of the operating carrier of each segment (slices[].segments[].operating_carrier.name). This must be displayed prominently on the first screen where the offer is presented in order to comply with US regulations.

Body parameters
order_id
string
required
The order ID you wish to change

Example: "ord_0000A3bQ8FJIQoEfuC07n6"
private_fares
The private fare codes for this order change request. The key is the airline's IATA code that provided the private fare code. The corporate_code and tour_code are provided to you by the airline and the tracking_reference is to identify your business by the airlines. The private fares for Order Change Requests work in much the same way as they do when searching for an offer request

Example: {"UA":[{"corporate_code":"1234","tour_code":"578DFL"}]}

slices
object
The slices that make up this offer request. One-way journeys can be expressed using one slice, whereas return trips will need two.

Order Change Offers
After you've searched for flights to add to your order by creating an order change request, we'll send information about the changes you want to make to the airline, which may return order change offers.

Each order change offer represents flights you can buy from the airline at a particular price that meets your search criteria.

You'll see slices inside the offers. Each slice will also include a list of one or more specific flights (called segments) that the airline is offering to get the passengers where they want to go.

Schema
change_total_amount
string
The amount that will be charged or returned to the original payment method if refunded, determined according to the fare conditions. This may be negative to reflect a refund.

Example: "90.80"
change_total_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the change_total_amount, as an ISO 4217 currency code. It will match your organisation's billing currency unless youâ€™re using Duffel as an accredited IATA agent, in which case it will be in the currency provided by the airline (which will usually be based on the country where your IATA agency is registered).

Example: "GBP"

conditions
object
The conditions associated with this offer, describing the kinds of modifications you can make post-booking and any penalties that will apply to those modifications. This information assumes the condition is applied to all of the slices and passengers associated with this offer - for information at the slice level (e.g. "what happens if I just want to change the first slice?") refer to the slices. If a particular kind of modification is allowed, you may not always be able to take action through the Duffel API. In some cases, you may need to contact the Duffel support team or the airline directly.


conditions.change_before_departure
object
nullable
Whether the whole offer can be changed before the departure of the first slice. If all of the slices on the offer can be changed then the allowed property will be true. Refer to the slices for information about change penalties. If any of the slices on the offer can't be changed then the allowed property will be false. In this case you should refer to the slices conditions to determine if any part of the offer is changeable. If the airline hasn't provided any information about whether this offer can be changed then this property will be null.

conditions.change_before_departure.allowed
boolean
Whether this kind of modification is allowed post-booking

Example: true
conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_amount
string
nullable
If the modification is allowed then this is the amount payable to apply the modification to all passengers. If there is no penalty, the value will be zero. If the modification isn't allowed or the penalty is not known then this field will be null. If this is null then the penalty_currency will also be null.

Example: "100.00"
conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the penalty_amount as an ISO 4217 currency code. This will be in a currency determined by the airline, which is not necessarily the same as the currency of the offer or order. If this is null then penalty_amount will also be null.

Example: "GBP"

conditions.refund_before_departure
object
nullable
Whether the whole offer can be refunded before the departure of the first slice. If all of the slices on the offer can be refunded then the allowed property will be true and information will be provided about any penalties. If any of the slices on the offer can't be refunded then the allowed property will be false. If the airline hasn't provided any information about whether this offer can be refunded then this property will be null.

conditions.refund_before_departure.allowed
boolean
Whether this kind of modification is allowed post-booking

Example: true
conditions.refund_before_departure.penalty_amount
string
nullable
If the modification is allowed then this is the amount payable to apply the modification to all passengers. If there is no penalty, the value will be zero. If the modification isn't allowed or the penalty is not known then this field will be null. If this is null then the penalty_currency will also be null.

Example: "100.00"
conditions.refund_before_departure.penalty_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the penalty_amount as an ISO 4217 currency code. This will be in a currency determined by the airline, which is not necessarily the same as the currency of the offer or order. If this is null then penalty_amount will also be null.

Example: "GBP"
created_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the offer was created

Example: "2020-01-17T10:12:14.545Z"
expires_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the offer will expire and no longer be usable to create an order

Example: "2020-01-17T10:42:14.545Z"
id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "oco_0000A3vUda8dKRtUSQPSXw"
live_mode
boolean
Whether the order change offer was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the order change offer was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: false
new_total_amount
string
nullable
The price of this offer if it was newly purchased

Example: "35.50"
new_total_currency
string
The currency of the new_total_amount, as an ISO 4217 currency code. It will match your organisation's billing currency unless youâ€™re using Duffel as an accredited IATA agent, in which case it will be in the currency provided by the airline (which will usually be based on the country where your IATA agency is registered).

Example: "GBP"
order_change_id
string
nullable
The ID for an order change if one has already been created from this order change offer

Example: "oce_0000A4QasEUIjJ6jHKfhHU"
penalty_total_amount
string
nullable
The penalty imposed by the airline for making this change

Example: "10.50"
penalty_total_currency
string

Order Changes
Once you've created an order change request, and you've chosen which slices to add and remove, you'll then want to create an order change.

To create an order change, you just need to provide the order change offer ID.

If change_total_amount is greater than zero, you will need to provide payment details when confirming the change.

If change_total_amount is less than zero, this amount will be returned to the payment method specified by refund_to.

Schema
change_total_amount
string
The amount that will be charged or refunded, determined according to the fare conditions. A negative value will reflect a refund.

Example: "30.50"
change_total_currency
string
The currency of the change_total_amount, as an ISO 4217 currency code. It will match your organisation's billing currency unless youâ€™re using Duffel as an accredited IATA agent, in which case it will be in the currency provided by the airline (which will usually be based on the country where your IATA agency is registered).

Example: "GBP"
confirmed_at
datetime
nullable
The ISO 8601 datetime that indicates when the order change was confirmed

Example: "2020-01-17T11:51:43.114803Z"
created_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the order change was created

Example: "2020-04-11T15:48:11.642Z"
expires_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime by which this change must be confirmed

Example: "2020-01-17T10:42:14.545052Z"
id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "ocr_0000A3tQSmKyqOrcySrGbo"
live_mode
boolean
Whether the order change was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the order change was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: false
new_total_amount
string
The total price of the order for all the flights and services booked, including taxes, once the change is confirmed.

Example: "121.30"
new_total_currency
string
The currency of the new_total_amount, as an ISO 4217 currency code. It will match your organisation's billing currency unless youâ€™re using Duffel as an accredited IATA agent, in which case it will be in the currency provided by the airline (which will usually be based on the country where your IATA agency is registered).

Example: "GBP"
order_id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the order which is being changed

Example: "ord_0000A3tQcCRZ9R8OY0QlxA"
penalty_total_amount
string
The amount charged by the airline for making this change.

Example: "15.50"
penalty_total_currency
string
The currency of the penalty_total_amount, as an ISO 4217 currency code. It will match your organisation's billing currency unless youâ€™re using Duffel as an accredited IATA agent, in which case it will be in the currency provided by the airline (which will usually be based on the country where your IATA agency is registered).

Example: "GBP"
refund_to
enum
nullable
Where the refund, once confirmed, will be sent. Refunds are indicated by a negative change_total_amount. If the change does not require a refund, this field will be null. original_form_of_payment refers to the form of payment used to create the order.

Possible values: "voucher" or "original_form_of_payment"

Partial Offer Requests
To search for and select flights separately for each slice of the journey, you'll need to create a partial offer request. A partial offer request describes the passengers and where and when they want to travel (in the form of a list of slices). It may also include additional filters (e.g. a particular cabin to travel in).

Schema
cabin_class
enum
nullable
The cabin that the passengers want to travel in

Possible values: "first", "business", "premium_economy", or "economy"
client_key
string
A client key to allow the Duffel Ancillaries component to talk to the Duffel API to retrieve information about an offer and its ancillaries. Learn more about how to use this on https://duffel.com/docs/guides/ancillaries-component.

Example: "SFMyNTY.g2gDdAAAAANkAAlsaXZlX21vZGVkAAVmYWxzZWQAD29yZ2FuaXNhdGlvbl9pZG0AAAAab3JnXzAwMDA5VWhGY29ERGk5TTFTRjhiS2FkAAtyZXNvdXJjZV9pZG0AAAAab3JxXzAwMDBBVkZWZnFJUXFBWXpYeVRRVlVuBgDpOCvdhwFiAAFRgA.df1RmLeBFUR7r1WFHHiEksilfSZNLhmPX0nj5VOKWJ4"
created_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the offer request was created

Example: "2020-02-12T15:21:01.927Z"
id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "orq_00009hjdomFOCJyxHG7k7k"
live_mode
boolean
Whether the offer request was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the offer request was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: false

offers
list
The offers returned by the airlines

offers.base_amount
string
The base price of the offer for all passengers, excluding taxes. It does not include the base amount of any service(s) that might be booked with the offer.

Example: "30.20"
offers.base_currency
string
The currency of the base_amount, as an ISO 4217 currency code. It will match your organisation's billing currency unless youâ€™re using Duffel as an accredited IATA agent, in which case it will be in the currency provided by the airline (which will usually be based on the country where your IATA agency is registered).

Example: "GBP"

offers.conditions
object
The conditions associated with this offer, describing the kinds of modifications you can make post-booking and any penalties that will apply to those modifications. This information assumes the condition is applied to all of the slices and passengers associated with this offer - for information at the slice level (e.g. "what happens if I just want to change the first slice?") refer to the slices. If a particular kind of modification is allowed, you may not always be able to take action through the Duffel API. In some cases, you may need to contact the Duffel support team or the airline directly.


offers.conditions.change_before_departure
object
nullable
Whether the whole offer can be changed before the departure of the first slice. If all of the slices on the offer can be changed then the allowed property will be true. Refer to the slices for information about change penalties. If any of the slices on the offer can't be changed then the allowed property will be false. In this case you should refer to the slices conditions to determine if any part of the offer is changeable. If the airline hasn't provided any information about whether this offer can be changed then this property will be null.

offers.conditions.change_before_departure.allowed
boolean
Whether this kind of modification is allowed post-booking

Example: true
offers.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_amount
string
nullable
If the modification is allowed then this is the amount payable to apply the modification to all passengers. If there is no penalty, the value will be zero. If the modification isn't allowed or the penalty is not known then this field will be null. If this is null then the penalty_currency will also be null.

Example: "100.00"
offers.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the penalty_amount as an ISO 4217 currency code. This will be in a currency determined by the airline, which is not necessarily the same as the currency of the offer or order. If this is null then penalty_amount will also be null.

Example: "GBP"

offers.conditions.refund_before_departure
object
nullable
Whether the whole offer can be refunded before the departure of the first slice. If all of the slices on the offer can be refunded then the allowed property will be true and information will be provided about any penalties. If any of the slices on the offer can't be refunded then the allowed property will be false. If the airline hasn't provided any information about whether this offer can be refunded then this property will be null.

offers.conditions.refund_before_departure.allowed
boolean
Whether this kind of modification is allowed post-booking

Example: true
offers.conditions.refund_before_departure.penalty_amount
string
nullable
If the modification is allowed then this is the amount payable to apply the modification to all passengers. If there is no penalty, the value will be zero. If the modification isn't allowed or the penalty is not known then this field will be null. If this is null then the penalty_currency will also be null.

Example: "100.00"
offers.conditions.refund_before_departure.penalty_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the penalty_amount as an ISO 4217 currency code. This will be in a currency determined by the airline, which is not necessarily the same as the currency of the offer or order. If this is null then penalty_amount will also be null.

Example: "GBP"
offers.created_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the offer was created

Example: "2020-01-17T10:12:14.545Z"
offers.expires_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime expiry of the offer before which the traveller should use this offer to create an order. After this time the offer can no longer be used to create an order.

Example: "2020-01-17T10:42:14.545Z"
offers.id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "off_00009htYpSCXrwaB9DnUm0"
offers.live_mode
boolean
Whether the offer request was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the offer request was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: true

offers.owner
object
The airline which provided the offer

offers.owner.conditions_of_carriage_url
string
nullable
URL to the airline's conditions of carriage.

Example: "https://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/legal/british-airways/general-conditions-of-carriage"
offers.owner.iata_code
string
nullable
The two-character IATA code for the airline. This may be null for non-IATA carriers.

Example: "BA"
offers.owner.id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the airline

Example: "arl_00001876aqC8c5umZmrRds"
offers.owner.logo_lockup_url
string
nullable
Path to a svg of the airline lockup logo. A lockup logo is also called a combination logo, in which it combines the logotype and logomark. This may be null if no logo is available.

Example: "https://assets.duffel.com/img/airlines/for-light-background/full-color-lockup/BA.svg"
offers.owner.logo_symbol_url
string
nullable
Path to a svg of the airline logo. This may be null if no logo is available.

Example: "https://assets.duffel.com/img/airlines/for-light-background/full-color-logo/BA.svg"
offers.owner.name
string
The name of the airline

Example: "British Airways"
offers.partial
boolean
Partial offers are a new concept we're introducing as a part of a new multi-step search flow that we're currently experimenting with. A partial offer can't be booked directly, but it can be combined with other partial offers to form a full offer. Partial offers are only ever returned through the multi-step search flow. So there's no need to add any handling to deal with partial offers if you're using the traditional OfferRequest search flow to create offers.

Example: true
offers.passenger_identity_documents_required
boolean
Whether identity documents must be provided for each of the passengers when creating an order based on this offer. If this is true, you must provide a passport document for every passenger.

Example: false

offers.passengers
list
The passengers included in the offer

offers.passengers.age
integer
nullable
The age of the passenger on the departure_date of the final slice

Example: 14
offers.passengers.family_name

Example: "Earhart"
offers.passengers.fare_type
string
nullable
The fare type of the passenger

Example: "contract_bulk"
offers.passengers.given_name
string
nullable
The passenger's given name

Example: "Amelia"
offers.passengers.id
string
The identifier for the passenger. This ID will be generated by Duffel

Example: "pas_00009hj8USM7Ncg31cBCL"

offers.passengers.loyalty_programme_accounts
list
The loyalty programme accounts for this passenger

offers.passengers.loyalty_programme_accounts.account_number
string
The passenger's account number for this loyalty programme account

Possible values: "adult", "child", or "infant_without_seat"

offers.payment_requirements
object
The payment requirements for this offer

offers.payment_requirements.payment_required_by
datetime
nullable
The ISO 8601 datetime by which you must pay for this offer. At this time, if still unpaid, the reserved space on the flight(s) will be released and you will have to create a new order. This will be null when the offer requires immediate payment - that is, when requires_instant_payment is true.

Example: "2020-01-17T10:42:14Z"
offers.payment_requirements.price_guarantee_expires_at
datetime
nullable
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the price associated with the order will no longer be guaranteed by the airline and may change before payment. This will be null when requires_instant_payment is true.

Example: "2020-01-17T10:42:14Z"
offers.payment_requirements.requires_instant_payment
boolean
When payment is required at the time of booking this will be true and payment_required_by and price_guarantee_expires_at will be null. When payment can be made at a time after booking, this will be false and the time limits on the payment will be provided in payment_required_by and price_guarantee_expires_at.

offers.slices
list
The slices that make up this offer. Each slice will include one or more segments, the specific flights that the airline is offering to take the passengers from the slice's origin to its destination. Partial offers contain a single slice as each partial offer is for a particular slice of the journey.

offers.slices.comparison_key
string
A hash uniquely identifying this slice. This value could be use to group together identical slices from different offers.

Example: "BmlZDw=="

offers.slices.conditions
object
The conditions associated with this slice, describing the kinds of modifications you can make post-booking and any penalties that will apply to those modifications and also what perks will be available to passengers when travelling.

This condition is applied only to this slice and to all the passengers associated with this offer - for information at the offer level (e.g. "what happens if I want to change all the slices?") refer to the conditions at the top level.

If a particular kind of modification is allowed, you may not always be able to take action through the Duffel API. In some cases, you may need to contact the Duffel support team or the airline directly.

Note that the perks associated with the slice are aggregated across passengers and segments and are intended to provide a brief summary of the passenger experience, however the experience may not be consistent across all segments. As an example, priority boarding may be flagged as available on the slice but not available on all segments on the slice.

Note: advance_seat_selection, priority_boarding and priority_check_in are under restricted NGS feature. If you need access, get in touch with the Duffel support team.

offers.slices.conditions.change_before_departure
object
nullable
Whether this slice can be changed before the departure. If the slice can be changed for all of the passengers then the allowed property will be true and information will be provided about any penalties. If none of the passengers on the slice can be changed then the allowed property will be false. In all other cases this property will be null indicating we can't provide the information for this slice. The penalty_amount is specific to changing this slice and may not be the penalty that is applied if the entire offer is changed.

offers.slices.conditions.change_before_departure.allowed
boolean
Whether this kind of modification is allowed post-booking

Example: true
offers.slices.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_amount
string
nullable
If the modification is allowed then this is the amount payable to apply the modification to all passengers. If there is no penalty, the value will be zero. If the modification isn't allowed or the penalty is not known then this field will be null. If this is null then the penalty_currency will also be null.

Example: "100.00"
offers.slices.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the penalty_amount as an ISO 4217 currency code. This will be in a currency determined by the airline, which is not necessarily the same as the currency of the offer or order. If this is null then penalty_amount will also be null.

Get a single partial offer request
Deprecated. This endpoint will be removed in the next major version of our API. Please take appropriate steps to remove usage of this endpoint.

Retrieves a partial offers request by its ID, only including partial offers for the current slice of multi-step search flow.

In order to view partial offers for the second slice of the itinerary, you need to provide the selected partial offer ID from the results of creating a partial offer request (which is considered the first slice of the journey).

For a multi-city search you might need to provide more than one selected partial offer ID. For example, when retrieving partial offers for the third slice, you need to provide selected partial offer IDs of two previous slices.

URL parameters
id
string
required
Duffel's unique identifier for the partial offer request

Example: "prq_0000AJyeTHVxxt8uMvXRaK"
Query parameters
selected_partial_offer[]
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the partial offer selected for previous slices. This parameter should be repeated for each selected partial offer.

Example: "?selected_partial_offer[]=off_0000AJyeTUCEoY5PhVPN8k_0&selected_partial_offer[]=off_0000AJyeTUCEoY5PhVPN8k_1"

Create a partial offer request
Deprecated. This endpoint will be removed in the next major version of our API. Please take appropriate steps to remove usage of this endpoint.

To search for and select flights separately for each slice of the journey, you'll need to create a partial offer request. A partial offer request describes the passengers and where and when they want to travel (in the form of a list of slices). It may also include additional filters (e.g. a particular cabin to travel in).

We'll send your search to a range of airlines, and return your offer request back to you with a series of offers for the first slice in your journey. Offers returned from a partial offer request will have the partial flag set to true.

Each partial offer represents a set of flights you can buy from an airline at a particular price that meet the criteria of a slice in your search.

Inside the partial offer you'll see the slice it pertains to, and each slice will also include a list of one or more specific flights (called segments) that the airline is offering to get the passengers where they want to go. The total amount of each partial offer represents the cheapest possible combination of partial offers for that itinerary.

When presenting partial offers to your customers, you should always show the full name of the operating carrier of each segment (slices[].segments[].operating_carrier.name). This must be displayed prominently on the first screen where the offer is presented in order to comply with US regulations.

Query parameters
supplier_timeout
integer
The maximum amount of time in milliseconds to wait for each airline search to complete. This timeout applies to the response time of the call to the airline and includes some additional overhead added by Duffel. Value should be between 2 seconds and 60 seconds. Any values outside the range will be ignored and the default supplier_timeout will be used. If a value is set, the response will only include offers from airline searches that completed within the given time. If a value is not set, the response will only include offers from airline searches that completed within the default supplier_timeout value of 20 seconds. We recommend setting supplier_timeout lower than the timeout on the HTTP request you send to Duffel API as that will allow us to respond with the offers we received before your request times out with an empty response.

Example: 10000
Default value: 20000
Body parameters
cabin_class
enum
nullable
The cabin that the passengers want to travel in

Possible values: "first", "business", "premium_economy", or "economy"
max_connections
integer
The maximum number of connections within any slice of the offer. For example 0 means a direct flight which will have a single segment within each slice and 1 means a maximum of two segments within each slice of the offer.

Example: 0
Default value: 1

passengers
list
required
The passengers who want to travel. If you specify an age for a passenger, the type may differ for the same passenger in different offers due to airline's different rules. e.g. one airline may treat a 14 year old as an adult, and another as a young adult. You may only specify an age or a type â€“ not both.

private_fares
The private fare codes for this offer request. You can pass in multiple airlines with their specific private fare codes. The key is the airline's IATA code that provided the private fare code. The corporate_code and tour_code are provided to you by the airline and the tracking_reference is to identify your business by the airlines.

Example: {"QF":[{"corporate_code":"FLX53","tracking_reference":"ABN:2345678"}],"UA":[{"corporate_code":"1234","tour_code":"578DFL"}]}

slices
list
required
The slices that make up this offer request. One-way journeys can be expressed using one slice, whereas return trips will need two.

Airline-Initiated Changes
Sometimes there can be changes to your order initiated by the airline, for example a flight being delayed.

We record every one of these changes so that you can view them all or for an order. You can filter changes for a specific order using the order_id parameter.

Each airline-initiated change contains an added and removed field. Added contains the updated slices following the change. These slices and their segments may have a new ID based on the change. Removed contains a list of slices and their segments as they were before the change.

Schema
action_taken
enum
nullable
The action taken in response to this airline-initiated change.

Accepted, cancelled and changed reflect your action in accepting the change, cancelling the order or changing the order respectively.

Possible values: "accepted", "cancelled", or "changed"
action_taken_at
string
nullable
The ISO 8601 datetime at which an action was taken

Example: "2022-01-17T10:12:14.545Z"

added
list
List of updated slices and segments following the change. These slices and segments may each have a new ID as a result of the changes.


added.conditions
object
required
The conditions associated with this slice, describing the kinds of modifications you can make and any penalties that will apply to those modifications. This condition is applied only to this slice and to all the passengers associated with this order - for information at the order level (e.g. "what happens if I want to change all the slices?") refer to the conditions at the top level. If a particular kind of modification is allowed, you may not always be able to take action through the Duffel API. In some cases, you may need to contact the Duffel support team or the airline directly.


added.conditions.change_before_departure
object
required
Whether this slice can be changed before the departure. If the slice can be changed for all of the passengers then the allowed property will be true and information will be provided about any penalties. If none of the passengers on the slice can be changed then the allowed property will be false. In all other cases this property will be null indicating we can't provide the information for this slice. The penalty_amount is specific to changing this slice and may not be the penalties that is applied if the entire order is changed.

added.conditions.change_before_departure.allowed
boolean
Whether this kind of modification is allowed post-booking

Example: true
added.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_amount
string
nullable
If the modification is allowed then this is the amount payable to apply the modification to all passengers. If there is no penalty, the value will be zero. If the modification isn't allowed or the penalty is not known then this field will be null. If this is null then the penalty_currency will also be null.

Example: "100.00"
added.conditions.change_before_departure.penalty_currency
string
nullable
The currency of the penalty_amount as an ISO 4217 currency code. This will be in a currency determined by the airline, which is not necessarily the same as the currency of the offer or order. If this is null then penalty_amount will also be null.

This endpoint is only available to those airline-initiated changes that Duffel cannot accept on behalf of the customer. Duffel is unable to accept an airline-initiated change when these two conditions aretrue: the order was booked with the merchant's IATA number and Duffel is unable to accept the airline-initiated change programatically. In this case you, the customer, are responsible to resolve airline-initiated changes concerning this order (e.g. by contacting the airline directly). Once these have been resolved, you need to inform us of the action taken so we can mark it accordingly in our system.

Batch Offer Requests
Batch offer requests are a mechanism for retrieving offers as they become available, instead of waiting for the entire offer payload to finish processing. They function as long-polling resources that you can repeatedly retrieve after creating them, returning whatever offers are available at the time or waiting for more to become available. Batches are expected to be consumed promptly, and as such, batch offer requests expire after one minute. However, offers remain accessible and can be retrieved using the offer request ID as usual.

Schema
client_key
string
A client key to allow the Duffel Ancillaries component to talk to the Duffel API to retrieve information about an offer and its ancillaries. Learn more about how to use this on https://duffel.com/docs/guides/ancillaries-component.

Example: "SFMyNTY.g2gDdAAAAANkAAlsaXZlX21vZGVkAAVmYWxzZWQAD29yZ2FuaXNhdGlvbl9pZG0AAAAab3JnXzAwMDA5VWhGY29ERGk5TTFTRjhiS2FkAAtyZXNvdXJjZV9pZG0AAAAab3JxXzAwMDBBVkZWZnFJUXFBWXpYeVRRVlVuBgDpOCvdhwFiAAFRgA.df1RmLeBFUR7r1WFHHiEksilfSZNLhmPX0nj5VOKWJ4"
created_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the offer request was created

Example: "2020-02-12T15:21:01.927Z"
id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "orq_00009hjdomFOCJyxHG7k7k"
live_mode
boolean
Whether the offer request was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the offer request was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: false
remaining_batches
number
The remaining number of batches of offers.

Example: 2
total_batches
number
The total number of batches of offers.

Example: 2
Create a batch offer request
A long-polling style API where you can kick off a search and then separately retrieve offers as they become available. The endpoint returns immediately with an ID and the number of batches to expect.

To retrieve the offers, please refer to the Show Batch Offer Request endpoint.

Query parameters
supplier_timeout
integer
The maximum amount of time in milliseconds to wait for each airline search to complete. This timeout applies to the response time of the call to the airline and includes some additional overhead added by Duffel. Value should be between 2 seconds and 60 seconds. Any values outside the range will be ignored and the default supplier_timeout will be used. If a value is set, the response will only include offers from airline searches that completed within the given time. If a value is not set, the response will only include offers from airline searches that completed within the default supplier_timeout value of 20 seconds. We recommend setting supplier_timeout lower than the timeout on the HTTP request you send to Duffel API as that will allow us to respond with the offers we received before your request times out with an empty response.

Example: 10000
Default value: 20000
Body parameters
cabin_class
enum
nullable
The cabin that the passengers want to travel in

Possible values: "first", "business", "premium_economy", or "economy"
max_connections
integer
The maximum number of connections within any slice of the offer. For example 0 means a direct flight which will have a single segment within each slice and 1 means a maximum of two segments within each slice of the offer.

Example: 0
Default value: 1

passengers
list
required
The passengers who want to travel. If you specify an age for a passenger, the type may differ for the same passenger in different offers due to airline's different rules. e.g. one airline may treat a 14 year old as an adult, and another as a young adult. You may only specify an age or a type â€“ not both.

private_fares
The private fare codes for this offer request. You can pass in multiple airlines with their specific private fare codes. The key is the airline's IATA code that provided the private fare code. The corporate_code and tour_code are provided to you by the airline and the tracking_reference is to identify your business by the airlines.

Example: {"QF":[{"corporate_code":"FLX53","tracking_reference":"ABN:2345678"}],"UA":[{"corporate_code":"1234","tour_code":"578DFL"}]}

slices
list
required
The slices that make up this offer request. One-way journeys can be expressed using one slice, whereas return trips will need two.

Get a single batch offer request
A long-polling style API where you can kick off a search via "Create a batch offer request" and then separately retrieve offers as they become available (with this endpoint?).

Call this endpoint repeatedly to retrieve all the offers as they become available. The total_batches and remaining_batches properties can be used to estimate the remaining amount of work, although you may receive multiple batches at the same time if multiple batches are available. Once you get a response with remaining_batches of 0 you can stop requesting the endpoint as there are no more offers coming.

Card
Once you've chosen which offer or quote you're ready to book, Card provides a way for you to use a customer's card to pay for travel. The travel suppliers will charge the customer's card directly for the booking.

To pay travel suppliers by card you first need to create a card, then authenticate the card transaction using a ThreeDSecureSession.

By default, cards remain in the vault for 25 minutes, after which they are deleted.

If you plan to reuse a card multiple times, you can create a multi-use card record by setting multi_use to true. The created record cannnot be used for payment, as it will not include a CVC. Instead, you can create additional card records for use for future payment, requiring only a CVC value to be supplied on checkout by providing cvc and card_id with the multi-use card id as values.

If you are paying with customer cards, please read our Paying with customer cards integration guide.

Only PCI-compliant customers can use the create API endpoint directly, for more information please read our Paying with cards in corporate booking tools

NOTE To ensure PCI-compliant card data handling, endpoints related to this resource use a different hostname: api.duffel.cards.

Schema
brand
enum
Card brand name. Card brands accepted for each transaction may vary per travel supplier.

Possible values: "visa", "mastercard", "uatp", "american_express", "diners_club", "jcb", or "discover"
id
string
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "tcd_00009hthhsUZ8W4LxQgkjb"
last_4_digits
string
Last 4 digits of the card number.

Example: "1234"
live_mode
boolean
Whether the card was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the card was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: true
multi_use
boolean
A true value indicates that the card can be used for future transactions until the expiration or until deleted. A false value indicates that the card will be automatically deleted once used or until the time indicated by unavailable_at, whichever happens first.

Example: false
unavailable_at
datetime
The ISO 8601 datetime at which the card will be automatically deleted.

Example: "2023-04-13T15:48:11.642Z"
Delete a Card
You can use this endpoint to Delete a Card record by its ID.

The endpoint works for all cards, but it's particularly useful for multi-use cards, as single use cards are automatically deleted after 25 minutes or after they are used, whichever comes first.

NOTE To ensure PCI-compliant card data handling, the URL for this API endpoint is different: https://api.duffel.cards.

URL parameters
id
string
required
Duffel's unique identifier for the resource

Example: "tcd_00009hthhsUZ8W4LxQgkjb"

Response


Create a Card
A card that can be used to pay for an offer or a quote you wish to book. Once created, the card can be used on other endpoints by supplying the card ID.

By default, cards are automatically deleted after 25 minutes or after they are used, whichever comes first.

If you wish to store a customers card for multiple future transactions, you can create a multi-use card record by setting multi_use to true. The created record cannnot be used for payment, as it will not include a CVC. To pay with a multi-use card, you must request the cardholder supply their CVC on each future checkout. In subsequent transactions, you then provide the CVC and card_id of the multi-use card.

NOTE To ensure PCI-compliant card data handling, the URL for this API endpoint is different: https://api.duffel.cards.

}ThreeDSecureSession
Card payments must be authenticated before authorisation of a payment. The ThreeDSecureSession API performs that authentication. To pay for bookings by card using a Card record, you need to use the result of a ThreeDSecureSession.

Using the ThreeDSecureSession endpoints directly is only for scenarios where an authentication challenge requires no action by the cardholder, for example, where their payments meet the criteria as a Secure Corporate Payment.

To determine if this is relevant to you, please read the Requirements section of our Paying with cards in corporate booking tools implementation guide.

Schema
card_id
string
The card ID used to initiate the 3DS session.

Example: "tcd_0000AWr2XsTRIF1Vp34gh5"
client_id
string
Used to initialise the UI component when status is challenge_required

Example: "tds_visa_5a9a7b0a574c"
id
string
The ID of the ThreeDSecureSession.

Example: "3ds_0000AWr2XsTRIF1Vp34gh5"
live_mode
boolean
Whether the 3DS session was created in live mode. This field will be set to true if the card was created in live mode, or false if it was created in test mode.

Example: true
resource_id
string
The offer, order ID or booking ID that the 3DS session is for.

Example: "off_0000AKTurT99qsmGTujhis"
status
enum
The status of the 3DS session.

challenge_required - The 3DS session requires the UI Component to be initialised. This is the initial state when the payment requires a 3DS challenge.

ready_for_payment - The 3DS session is ready to be used on a payment object as part of a order creation/payment request. This is the initial state if the card or the supplier does not support 3DS.

failed - The 3DS session was not authenticated to proceed with the payment. Payment should not be attempted. Cardholder should try again, possibly with a different card. Additionally, this is the initial state if the cardholder details are invalid.

expired - The 3DS session has expired. A new session should be created if needed.

Possible values: "challenge_required", "ready_for_payment", "failed", or "expired"
Create a 3DS Session
Creates a 3DS session for a given card, with the resource (i.e. offer, hold order,...) and optional services (i.e. bags, seats) you wish to pay for.

Once created, the 3DS session will either be ready for payment or require a challenge.

For 3DS sessions using individual cards where the cardholder is present, the cardholder may need to complete a challenge provided by the card issuer. You will need to use the UI component to render the challenge.

To learn how to integrate 3DS into your checkout, please read our Paying with customer cards integration guide.

Body parameters
card_id
string
required
The card ID. This should be the card ID that's going to be submitted for payment.

Example: "tcd_00009hthhsUZ8W4LxQgkjb"
exception
enum

Possible values: "secure_corporate_payment"
resource_id
string
required
The resource that is going to be submitted for payment after a 3DS session status is ready for payment. This is used together with services to calculate the payment amount in the currency to be paid.

Sessions
A session represents the traveller's session as they go through the search and book flow to create an order.

You should create a session every time a user wishes to go through the search and book flow.

Once an order has been created as part of a session, the session can't be used to make more orders, and visiting it will take users to the confirmation page of the order that was created, provided the session hasn't timed out.

Each session is valid for 20 minutes after it is first used, and can be used up to 24 hours after it is created.

Schema
url
string
The URL to the search and book session. Redirect travellers to this URL to take them to Links. If youâ€™re using a custom subdomain, the URL will use your subdomain. Otherwise, itâ€™ll use links.duffel.com.

Webhooks
Webhooks are used to automatically receive notifications of events that happen. For example, when an order has a schedule change.

Once you receive an event on your server, you can process and act on it as you need.

You can manage your webhooks on the Duffel Dashboard.

Create a webhook
To start receiving notifications of events, you'll need to create a webhook that details the server that will receive the notifications. The webhook will be created in live mode or test mode based on the access token you're using. If you're using a test mode access token, the webhook will be created in test mode and will receive events related to test mode resources. If you're using a live mode access token, it'll receive events related to live mode.

Duffel only allows one webhook to be defined per live mode value, basically your organisation can only have one url with live_mode: true and another with live_mode: false.

To ensure the highest level of security we run some checks on the URL we receive, the URL must be for an https server, we do not accept IP addresses and some URLs are blacklisted (e.g. https://localhost).

By default, the webhook will be active.

Body parameters
events
string[]
required
The events that this webhook will be subscribed to

Example: ["order.created","order.airline_initiated_change_detected"]
url
string
required
The URL where your webhook will be received

Example: "https://www.example.com/webhooks"
