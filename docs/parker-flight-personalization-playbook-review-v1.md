# Development Playbook Review - Parker Flight Personalization Project

## Quick Verdict

**Good skeleton üëç** ‚Äî captures phases, baseline metrics, and the big constraints.

**Not "bulletproof" yet ‚ö†Ô∏è** ‚Äî still missing the day-level granularity, copy-paste commands, checkpoints, and rollback triggers you asked Warp to include.

Below is a structured review plus the gaps I'd plug before you approve the plan.

## What's Solid

| ‚úî Strength | Why it helps |
|------------|-------------|
| Baseline metrics recorded | Shows tests/build size up front, so perf regressions can be tracked. |
| Phased timeline (Weeks 1-4) | Gives a clear cadence that matches the 4-week window. |
| Guiding principles list | Reinforces bundle, GDPR, and rollback constraints. |
| Definition of Done spelled out | Keeps the whole team focused on success criteria. |

## Missing / Weak Areas

| ‚ö†Ô∏è Gap | What's needed | Reason |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Day-level tasks (‚âà 6 h blocks) | Break each week into Day N tasks with numbered subtasks (e.g., "Day 3 AM: supabase migration new add_next_trip_city; Day 3 PM: run npm run migrate && npm test"). | Matches the template and helps devs plan their actual calendar. |
| Copy-paste commands & scripts | Each task should include concrete CLI examples (supabase functions deploy, ld create-flag, npm run lighthouse:ci). | Reduces ambiguity, speeds execution. |
| ‚úÖ checkpoints & owners | Add explicit review gates ("‚úÖ DB migration applied in staging", "PM signs off on flag rule"). Assign FE/BE/QA owners. | Ensures accountability and early bug catching. |
| Rollback / risk triggers | List the exact metrics that trip a rollback (">5 % LCP regression", "error rate >0.5 %"). Include the one-liner to disable the flag. | So on-call knows when/how to yank the feature. |
| Testing details | Specify unit vs e2e file names, Cypress command, Lighthouse perf gate in CI. | QA can script tests without guessing. |
| CI/CD hooks | Mention updating GitHub Actions (or whatever) to run new tests, push migrations, and upload Web-Vitals JSON. | Keeps pipeline green. |
| Docs & KT | Elaborate: where to put voice-guide, schema diagram, post-mortem template. | Smooth hand-off after launch. |
| Edge-function & schema code snippets | Even a stub index.ts and ALTER TABLE snippet speeds dev start. | Avoids digging through prior briefs. |
| Opt-out banner | Timeline doesn't show when banner copy/design is produced or reviewed by Legal. | GDPR acceptance criteria could slip. |

## Suggested Next Step

Ask Warp to regenerate the playbook with these explicit instructions:

**"Refine the playbook by:**

1. **Breaking each week into day-level tasks (6 h blocks) with numbered subtasks.**

2. **Adding command / code snippets for every dev task.**

3. **Inserting ‚úÖ review checkpoints and owner roles for each phase.**

4. **Listing rollback triggers and the exact ld disable command.**

5. **Detailing testing & CI steps (unit, e2e, Lighthouse).**

6. **Calling out the opt-out banner design / legal sign-off task.**

**Stop after rewriting; wait for my approval."**

That will transform today's high-level outline into a truly "bulletproof" day-by-day execution map.

## Current Playbook Assessment

### Original Playbook Structure:

#### 1. Executive Summary
- ‚úÖ Baseline metrics captured
- ‚úÖ Tech stack identified
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Build issues noted but not addressed in timeline

#### 2. Guiding Principles
- ‚úÖ Performance constraints clear
- ‚úÖ Compliance requirements stated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing specific rollback procedures

#### 3. Config / Schema Design
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Too high-level, needs concrete code examples
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing migration scripts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No feature flag configuration details

#### 4. Phased Timeline
- ‚úÖ 4-week structure appropriate
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lacks day-level granularity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing concrete commands
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No checkpoint reviews
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No owner assignments

#### 5. Monitoring & Rollback Strategy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Too vague, needs specific triggers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing actual rollback commands
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No monitoring setup instructions

#### 6. Testing & CI/CD Plan
- ‚ö†Ô∏è High-level only, needs specific test files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing CI configuration updates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No Lighthouse integration details

#### 7. Documentation & Knowledge-transfer Plan
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Generic, needs specific deliverables
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing knowledge transfer sessions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No documentation templates

#### 8. Definition of Done / Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Engagement metrics defined
- ‚úÖ Performance thresholds clear
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing measurement implementation

## Immediate Action Required

The current playbook needs significant enhancement to be truly "bulletproof" and execution-ready. The main gaps are in operational details, concrete commands, and checkpoint accountability that would make this a copy-paste execution guide rather than a high-level overview.

**Recommendation:** Request Warp to regenerate with the specific improvements outlined above before proceeding with development.
