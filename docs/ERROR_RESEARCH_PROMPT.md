TripRequestForm Investigation and Resolution Plan
Overview of Issues
Test Failures:
Calendar Mock Not Rendering: The unit test simulating a date selection fails because the expected mock-day-picker element is not found. This indicates the calendar component wasn’t properly mocked or inserted during tests, so the test can’t interact with it.
Submit Button Disabled (Auto-Booking Off): In scenarios where auto-booking is turned off, the submit button never enables. This suggests a validation logic flaw – likely a field like maxPrice is still treated as required even when auto-booking is off, preventing the form from becoming “valid.”
Warnings:
Unwrapped State Updates: React’s test console shows warnings about state updates not wrapped in act(...). This means some component state changes (possibly from async effects or events) occurred outside of React’s controlled render cycle in tests, implying missing act or waitFor wrappers around those interactions
legacy.reactjs.org
kentcdodds.com
.
Build Warnings (Imports & Chunk Size): The build reports warnings about module imports and bundle size. Specifically, supabase/client.ts is contributing to large chunks, and there may be a mix of dynamic vs. static imports causing inefficiencies. Vite/Rollup suggests using dynamic import() or manual chunk splitting to address chunks over 500KB
github.com
github.com
. This likely means the Supabase client (and its dependencies) are being bundled in a way that inflates the main bundle, perhaps by being imported in every build context instead of lazily.
Root Cause Analysis
1. Calendar Mock Test Failure: The TripRequestForm’s date picker component isn’t being rendered as expected in the test environment. Likely causes include:
The component wasn’t mocked correctly in the test. For example, if using a third-party calendar, a jest mock should replace it with a dummy implementation. If the test expected an element with data-testid="mock-day-picker", the mock may not have been registered or used at the right scope.
The mock component might not be imported or loaded due to scope issues (e.g. calling jest.mock after the component is imported). Jest requires that jest.mock('ModuleName') is called before the module is imported in the test
stackoverflow.com
. If not, the real component renders (which likely doesn’t have the mock-day-picker test ID), causing getByTestId('mock-day-picker') to fail.
2. Submit Button Disabled (Auto-Booking Off): The form’s validation logic is too rigid, causing the submit button to stay disabled. Specifically, when auto-booking is off, certain fields (e.g. maxPrice) should be optional, but the current logic still treats them as required. This dependency means the form never reaches a “valid” state unless maxPrice is filled, which is unintended for the off scenario. Possible root causes:
The form uses a single validation schema or condition that always includes maxPrice. There’s no conditional rule to skip maxPrice when auto-booking is false. For instance, a Yup or custom validation might not have a .when() condition on the auto-booking flag.
The component state enabling the submit button doesn’t update when auto-booking toggles. If the code checks all fields including maxPrice, turning off auto-booking should ideally remove maxPrice from “required” checks. Without that, the button remains disabled because it thinks a required field is empty.
3. React “act()” Warnings: The warnings (Warning: An update to <Component> inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)) indicate that asynchronous state updates are happening without the test waiting for them
kentcdodds.com
. In React Testing Library, most user events are wrapped in act, but updates from async operations (timers, promises, effects) after user events require explicit handling. Likely scenarios in TripRequestForm:
Changing a field or toggling auto-booking triggers an effect (e.g. re-validating the form or enabling the button) that updates state after a delay or in the next tick. If the test doesn’t wait for that update, React logs a warning.
The tests possibly fire events (like clicking the submit or toggling a checkbox) and then assert immediately, without awaiting the subsequent DOM change. React’s advice is to wrap state-updating interactions in act or use RTL’s waitFor/findBy utilities to wait for the UI to settle
legacy.reactjs.org
kentcdodds.com
.
4. Build Import/Chunk Warnings: The build warnings highlight two things:
Dynamic vs Static Import: There might be an instance where supabase/client.ts (or something it imports) is loaded via dynamic import() in some places and statically in others. This can confuse the bundler, causing duplicate code or suboptimal chunking. Consistency is key: mixing import styles can prevent Rollup from properly sharing modules between chunks.
Oversized Supabase Bundle: Supabase’s client library (and its dependencies like Postgrest, GoTrue, etc.) is being bundled into the main chunk, hitting the size warning. Vite suggests splitting such large dependencies. The root cause could be that supabase/client.ts is imported globally (thus always included), or not code-split. Also, Supabase’s package might include Node polyfills (like for 'stream' or other built-ins), further bloating the bundle if not handled.
Recommended Solutions and Changes
1. Fixing the Calendar Mock in Tests
Correct the Mock Implementation: Ensure the date picker component is properly mocked so that it renders a test-friendly element. For example, if TripRequestForm uses a <DayPicker> from a library, add in the test (or a mocks file):
js
Copy
jest.mock('path/to/DayPicker', () => () => <div data-testid="mock-day-picker" />);
This replaces the real calendar with a simple stub. The mock returns a <div> with data-testid="mock-day-picker", which the test can find
dev.to
. Verify that this jest.mock is called before rendering the form in the test (ideally at the top of the test file, before importing TripRequestForm) to avoid the real component rendering
stackoverflow.com
. If the TripRequestForm expects certain props or interactions on the calendar, the mock can be expanded to simulate that. For instance, it could accept onDateSelect prop and call it on a dummy event. But initially, just rendering a placeholder allows the test to locate it. With this fix, the test assertion getByTestId('mock-day-picker') should pass when the component renders. Verify the Test Logic: After fixing the mock, re-run the tests for the calendar interaction. If the test is supposed to simulate selecting a date, you may need to simulate a click on the mock-day-picker element or trigger the date selection callback. Because the actual calendar is mocked out, you might directly invoke the handler. For example, if TripRequestForm passes onChange to DayPicker, your mock could call onChange(newDate) when “clicked.” Ensure the test covers this: e.g. simulate a date pick and then assert that the form state updated (perhaps the date field value or that the submit became enabled).
2. Correcting Form Validation Logic (Submit Enablement)
Decouple Validation from Irrelevant Fields: Update the form’s validation so that when auto-booking is off, fields exclusive to auto-booking are not required. In this case, maxPrice should be optional or ignored if auto-booking is false. There are a couple of ways to implement this:
Conditional Schema (if using Yup or similar): Utilize Yup’s .when() or conditional validation. For example, in a Yup schema:
js
Copy
maxPrice: Yup.number().when('autoBooking', {
  is: true,  // when auto-booking is on
  then: (schema) => schema.required("Max price is required when auto-booking is on"),
  otherwise: (schema) => schema.optional().nullable()
})
This ensures maxPrice is only required if autoBooking is true, and not required (can even be null) otherwise
dev.to
dev.to
. Apply similar conditional logic for any other fields (e.g. perhaps pickup time windows, etc.) tied to auto-booking.
Inline Logic for Enable/Disable: If not using a schema, adjust the code that computes form validity. For instance, when determining if the Submit button should be enabled:
js
Copy
const baseFieldsFilled = /* check required fields like pickup, dropoff, date, etc. */;
const priceValid = !autoBookingOff ? (maxPrice !== "" && maxPrice !== null) : true;
const formIsValid = baseFieldsFilled && priceValid;
Here, priceValid is set to true when auto-booking is off (meaning we don’t need a price)
dev.to
. Only when auto-booking is on do we enforce that maxPrice has a value. Then use formIsValid to enable the submit button (e.g., disabled={!formIsValid} on the button). This change will allow the submit button to become enabled as soon as all truly required fields are provided in the auto-booking off scenario.
State Updates on Toggle: When the user toggles auto-booking off, also consider clearing or resetting maxPrice validation state. For example, if the form library still holds an error like “MaxPrice is required”, you might need to reset that error. In React Hook Form, this could mean calling clearErrors('maxPrice') or similar when autoBooking switches off. The key is to trigger a re-validation when the toggle changes, so the form recalculates validity with the new rules.
After implementing these changes, test the form behavior manually and with unit tests:
With auto-booking ON: leaving maxPrice empty should still disable submit (required). Filling it (and other fields) enables submit.
With auto-booking OFF: the form should ignore maxPrice. Submit should enable once other required fields (like locations and dates) are filled, regardless of maxPrice. The maxPrice field could be hidden or simply optional in the UI.
3. Eliminating React act(...) Warnings in Tests
Wrap Asynchronous Updates in Tests: To satisfy React’s requirement, ensure any interaction that causes a state update is awaited or wrapped. React Testing Library’s utilities (fireEvent or userEvent) are synchronous for events, but if those events trigger an async state (like an API call or setTimeout), you must wait for the outcome. Use one of the following strategies:
waitFor or findBy Queries: Instead of immediately asserting after an action, wait for the DOM to reflect the state change. For example, if toggling auto-booking is supposed to enable the submit button, do:
js
Copy
fireEvent.click(screen.getByLabelText(/auto-booking/i)); // toggle the checkbox
await waitFor(() => 
  expect(screen.getByRole('button', {name: /submit/i})).toBeEnabled()
);
The waitFor will retry the expectation until the button becomes enabled, internally wrapping re-renders in act
kentcdodds.com
. This prevents the “not wrapped in act” warning because the test is now accounting for the state update.
Explicit act: In cases where you have a Promise or a manual state trigger, you can use React’s act() directly. For example:
js
Copy
await act(async () => {
  // e.g., advance timers or wait for a promise resolution
  jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000);
});
However, RTL’s async utilities often make this unnecessary
kentcdodds.com
. Only use act directly for complex cases (like testing custom hooks with timers, etc.), or when a state update happens after the test completes. The goal is to make the test wait for all pending updates.
Update Testing Patterns: Review test cases for any direct state manipulations. For instance, avoid calling component setters directly in tests (as that would indeed be outside act). Instead, simulate user actions only. If a test must simulate an async data fetch, consider using jest.mock to resolve the promise immediately and await findBy... to detect when UI is updated. Ensuring the test waits for “loading” messages to disappear or for new content to appear will naturally wrap the updates
kentcdodds.com
kentcdodds.com
.
By applying these changes, tests will better reflect real user flows (wait for UI changes after actions) and the warnings should disappear. Each warning essentially pointed out a scenario the test missed. After fixes, the tests become more robust: for example, testing that a “Saving…” message appears then disappears, or that toggling a field eventually causes a button to enable, etc., as the real app would behave
kentcdodds.com
kentcdodds.com
. Additionally, ensure cleanup between tests. The testing library automatically cleans mounted components between tests, but if you introduced any manual act or global async handlers (like setTimeout), reset them. For example, if fake timers were used, call jest.useRealTimers() in an afterEach. This prevents cross-test interference that could also trigger act warnings.
4. Resolving Build Warnings (Import Strategy & Chunking)
To address the build warnings, we need to both optimize module imports and split the bundle where appropriate:
Align Dynamic vs Static Imports: Audit how supabase/client.ts is imported. If it’s meant for client-side usage, ensure it’s not unintentionally included in server or static contexts. In a Vite SPA, this is less about SSR and more about not duplicating imports. Do not import the same module in two ways (e.g., import supabase from '@supabase/supabase-js' at the top of one file, and using import('...') elsewhere). Choose one approach for the Supabase client:
Eager load statically at startup (acceptable if size is small and used everywhere).
Or lazily load dynamically only when needed (better if the app can defer loading Supabase, e.g., only on pages that hit the database).
Given the warning about chunk size, a dynamic import for Supabase might be beneficial. For example, instead of import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js' at the top of your client module, you could do:
js
Copy
async function getSupabaseClient() {
  const { createClient } = await import('@supabase/supabase-js');
  return createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY);
}
Then call getSupabaseClient() when you actually need to make a request. This way, the heavy library is split into a separate chunk that loads on demand. Be mindful to handle the promise (perhaps cache the client after first load). The main idea is to prevent Supabase from inflating the initial bundle by loading it only when required.
Manual Chunk Splitting: Whether or not you use dynamic imports in code, you can also leverage Rollup’s manual chunk configuration for large dependencies. In vite.config.js, add a rule to isolate Supabase (and potentially other big deps like Firebase, etc.) into its own chunk:
js
Copy
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  // ...other config...
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          supabase: ['@supabase/supabase-js']  // all supabase-js code in a separate file
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
This will produce a supabase.js chunk that the app can load separately. It improves caching (since vendor code changes less often than app code) and ensures the main bundle is leaner
github.com
github.com
. For more granular control, you can use the function form of manualChunks to group other libraries too (as shown in Vite’s docs and community examples).
Address Polyfill Warnings: If the build complained about Node built-ins (e.g., "stream" or others) due to Supabase, consider adding polyfills or aliases. For example, Vite 4+ doesn’t include Node polyfills by default. You might need:
js
Copy
resolve: {
  alias: {
    // if supabase requires 'stream' module
    stream: 'rollup-plugin-node-polyfills/polyfills/stream'
  }
}
(and install rollup-plugin-node-polyfills). However, check Supabase’s documentation – recent versions of @supabase/supabase-js are browser-friendly. This is just for completeness in case the build logs mention it.
Suppressing vs. Solving Warnings: Vite’s warning is primarily informative. You can raise build.chunkSizeWarningLimit to a higher value to suppress the message, but the better approach is indeed to code-split
github.com
. Only consider upping the limit if after splitting, a chunk is still legitimately large (e.g., some huge lib you cannot easily split further). The ultimate goal is to keep initial load small and split code by feature or vendor.
After implementing these changes, do a fresh build and inspect the output: you should see a separate chunk for Supabase. The warning about chunk size should disappear (since each chunk is now below the threshold). The application’s performance should improve as well – less JavaScript on first load and the Supabase code loaded only when needed.
Example Outcome:
If we split Supabase, the build might log something like: supabase.js – 120 KiB and the main chunk reduced by that amount. The dynamic import approach will show Supabase being loaded in the network tab only when invoked. This modularization also helps long-term: for instance, if auto-booking off means the user might not need Supabase calls immediately, they won’t pay the cost until necessary.
Test & Build Infrastructure Enhancements
Beyond fixing the specific issues, a few structural improvements are suggested:
Centralize Mocks and Setup: Create a consistent test setup file for commonly mocked modules (like the calendar or any heavy external modules). This avoids duplicating mock logic and ensures all tests use the same stub implementations. For example, configure Jest to automatically use the calendar mock before each test suite (via jest.config.js or a setup file). This would guarantee no test accidentally tries to render the real, complex calendar component.
Use Testing Library Best Practices: Continue to use React Testing Library for simulating user behavior, and prefer its queries that reflect user-visible states (like getByRole, getByText) rather than overly internal ones. This often indirectly forces you to wait for actual UI changes (preventing act warnings). Also, upgrade to the latest Testing Library and Jest versions if not already, as they provide better error messages when act is needed. For instance, Testing Library’s async utilities are already wrapped in act, as noted in React’s docs
kentcdodds.com
, so use them instead of manual setTimeout in tests.
Performance Testing of Build: After chunk splitting, test the application’s critical paths. Ensure that the dynamic import of Supabase (if implemented) doesn’t introduce a noticeable delay when first used. If it does, you might preload it after initial render (e.g., using import('@supabase/supabase-js') without awaiting, just to warm the chunk). Vite will also modulepreload dynamic chunks by default, which helps. Analyze bundle with source-map analyzer or vite build --analysis to confirm the contents of each chunk – verify that Supabase (and possibly its deps like @supabase/gotrue-js, etc.) moved out of the main chunk.
ManualChunks Strategy: Keep an eye on bundle size growth. The manual chunk config may need updates as dependencies change. For instance, if you add another large library (Mapbox, Firebase, etc.), consider grouping it similarly. The Vite community example above showed splitting one vendor chunk into multiple
dev.to
dev.to
. This can be applied based on your app’s usage patterns (e.g., separate chunks for “mapLibraries”, “authLibraries”, etc., as needed).
Build Import Consistency: If using Next.js (TripRequestForm could be part of a Next app given the file naming), ensure that supabase/client.ts is only used on the client side. Next 13+ might require marking server components or using the use client directive appropriately. If supabase/client.ts was giving a warning about export const dynamic = 'force-static', consider removing that or adjusting usage as per Next’s guidelines
github.com
. Essentially, follow framework-specific recommendations to avoid bundling server-only code into client bundles or vice versa.
Summary
We identified that inadequate test isolation and tight coupling in validation logic led to TripRequestForm’s test failures. By properly mocking the date picker component (so tests can reliably find mock-day-picker)
dev.to
 and by introducing conditional validation for auto-booking scenarios (making maxPrice optional when appropriate)
dev.to
, we resolve the functional issues. The React state update warnings were a signal to improve our tests – wrapping interactions in act() or using waitFor to await async state changes makes tests both pass without warnings and more accurately cover user-visible behavior
legacy.reactjs.org
kentcdodds.com
. On the build front, we addressed the warnings by refactoring import strategy and splitting bundles. Unifying how we import Supabase and leveraging code-splitting (dynamic imports or Rollup’s manualChunks) ensures the Supabase client doesn’t over-bloat the initial bundle
github.com
github.com
. This results in cleaner builds with each chunk under size limits, and a more performant app. With these fixes, TripRequestForm should now pass all tests, with the submit button enabling correctly in all scenarios, and run without React warnings. The production build will be optimized: critical code loads first, and heavy libraries like Supabase load on demand. All changes are made with maintainability in mind – validation rules are clearer, tests are more resilient, and the build is configured to handle growth. This lays a solid foundation for further development on TripRequestForm and the codebase at large.
