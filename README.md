## Feature Flag Utilities

### userInBucket

`userInBucket(userId: string, rollout: number) => boolean`

- Description: Determines if a user falls within the specified rollout percentage using consistent hashing with MurmurHash.
- Parameters:
  - userId (string): The unique user identifier.
  - rollout (number): The rollout percentage (0-100).
- Returns: true if the user should see the feature, false otherwise.
- Why MurmurHash? Fast, non-cryptographic, stable across runtimes â€” ideal for consistent user bucketing.

### Example Usage

```typescript
type UserId = string
const isEligible = userInBucket('user123', 10)
console.log(isEligible) // true if user falls within the 10% rollout
```

- Anti-pattern guard: no remote https imports in tests/vi.mock
- Unit/Integration tests with coverage thresholds
- Edge functions tests with coverage thresholds
- E2E Smoke on all PRs
