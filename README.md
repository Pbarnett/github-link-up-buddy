# Parker Flight

An autonomous flight booking application that monitors flight prices and automatically books flights when user-defined criteria are met. Built with React/TypeScript frontend, Supabase backend, and integrated with flight data APIs (Amadeus for search, Duffel for booking) and secure payment processing. Duffel acts as the Merchant of Record, handling all payment processes to reduce PCI scope.

## Core Features

- **Autonomous Flight Booking**: Set preferences and let the system automatically book flights when criteria are met
- **Real-time Flight Monitoring**: Background jobs monitor flight prices using Amadeus API
- **Secure Payment Processing**: Stripe integration with two-step authorization and capture
- **User Authentication**: Email magic link and Google OAuth authentication
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, responsive interface with 2025 design standards
- **Flight Search & Results**: Manual flight search with booking URL generation

## Amadeus Flight API

The application integrates with the Amadeus Flight API for real flight searches. 

### Configuration
- Environment variables:
  ```
  AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
  AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
  AMADEUS_BASE_URL=https://test.api.amadeus.com
  ```
- Supabase Secrets: The Amadeus variables above and the Stripe variables below must be added as Edge Function Secrets in the Supabase Dashboard (Project Settings â†’ API â†’ Edge Function Secrets).
  - **Stripe Secrets**:
    - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your Stripe secret key (e.g., `sk_test_...` or `sk_live_...`).
    - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Your Stripe webhook signing secret for the `stripe-webhook` function (e.g., `whsec_...`).
- Rate limit: The Amadeus API has rate limits of approximately 1 request/second, 50 requests/minute
- Throttling & retry logic is built into our implementation

### Retry Logic
The application implements exponential backoff for API requests:
- Retries up to 3 times on rate limits (HTTP 429) or server errors
- Base delay of 500ms, doubles with each retry (500ms â†’ 1s â†’ 2s)
- Network errors are also automatically retried
- Performance metrics are tracked and reported

### Testing & Monitoring

#### Unit Tests
Run the test suite with:
```bash
pnpm test
```

The test suite includes:
- OAuth token management tests
- Retry logic tests
- Response transformation tests
- Error handling tests

#### Manual Testing
A test script is provided to manually invoke the flight search function:
```bash
node scripts/testFlightSearch.js <trip-request-id>
```

This script:
- Verifies the trip request exists
- Invokes the flight-search edge function
- Checks for new offers and matches in the database
- Reports performance metrics

#### Performance Monitoring
The edge functions track and report the following metrics:
- `totalDurationMs`: Total execution time in milliseconds
- `retryCount`: Number of retries performed on API calls
- Counts of processed requests, matches, and errors

Use these metrics to:
- Identify slow or failing requests
- Monitor rate limit impacts
- Ensure the system is performing within expected parameters

### Flight Search v2

A new version of the flight search functionality (V2) is being developed. This version introduces a new data path and user interface for displaying flight offers.

**Key Components:**

*   **`flight_offers_v2` Table:** A new database table to store V2 flight offers.
*   **`/flight-offers-v2` Edge Function:** Retrieves V2 flight offers based on a `trip_request_id`.
*   **`flight_search_v2_enabled` Feature Flag:** Controls the availability of the V2 functionality (both in environment variables and the `feature_flags` database table).
*   **`useFlightOffers` Hook (`src/flightSearchV2/useFlightOffers.ts`):**
    *   Fetches V2 flight offers via a server action.
    *   Handles mapping from database schema (snake_case) to application schema (camelCase).
    *   Includes cancellation-on-unmount and early return if the feature flag is disabled.
*   **`getFlightOffers` Server Action (`src/serverActions/getFlightOffers.ts`):**
    *   Calls the `/flight-offers-v2` edge function.
    *   Implements a 5-minute in-memory cache for results.
*   **`TripOffersV2.tsx` Page (`src/pages/TripOffersV2.tsx`):**
    *   A new page that utilizes the `useFlightOffers` hook to display V2 flight offers.
    *   Includes loading, empty, and error states.
    *   Shows a placeholder if the V2 feature flag is disabled.

**Testing:**

*   Unit tests for the `getFlightOffers` server action (Vitest, mocked fetch).
*   Hook tests for `useFlightOffers` (Vitest with RTL, covering success, flag-off, invalid ID, unmount).
*   Component tests for `TripOffersV2.tsx` (RTL, covering loading, data, empty, and flag-disabled states).

**Accessing V2 Offers:**

*   Navigate to the `/trip/offers-v2` route (exact route might vary depending on router configuration for `TripOffersV2.tsx`).
*   Ensure the `flight_search_v2_enabled` feature flag is ON in your environment and database.
*   Ensure there is data in the `flight_offers_v2` table for a given `trip_request_id` that the page will use.
