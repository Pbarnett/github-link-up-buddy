Filtering Approach: API vs Post-Processing
To maximize efficiency, use a hybrid filtering strategy that leverages the Amadeus API for broad-stroke filters and in-code logic for finer rules. For example, query Amadeus with nonStop=true to only receive direct flights and include a return date to enforce round-trip results. The API also supports a currencyCode parameter to get prices in a desired currency, and a maxPrice to cap results by fare price. This means the Amadeus Flight Offers Search can pre-filter out flights with stops, one-way itineraries, or obviously over-budget base fares, reducing unnecessary data. However, not all business rules can be handled by the API alone – for instance, baggage inclusion and budget with bags require post-processing. Thus, after receiving results from Amadeus, the backend should apply additional filters in memory to enforce rules like “carry-on included” and adjust prices with baggage fees. This hybrid approach minimizes API calls (by not retrieving flights we’d reject anyway) while ensuring we catch details the API can’t filter (like ancillary fees). The result is a smaller, relevant dataset entering our system, on which we then run our custom filters to enforce every business rule.

Extensible Business Rule Engine Design
Design the filtering logic as a modular rule engine following a Pipe-and-Filter or Chain-of-Responsibility pattern. In this design, each business rule is implemented as an independent filter module that processes the list of flight offers and either transforms or filters them out accordingly. The flight data flows through a pipeline of these filters (non-stop filter, round-trip filter, baggage inclusion filter, budget filter, etc.), each applying one rule. This achieves separation of concerns – each filter focuses on a single criterion – making the system easy to extend and maintain. New rules (e.g. “max layover time” or “preferred airlines”) can be added simply by writing a new filter module and plugging it into the pipeline sequence. Because filters operate independently and share a common interface, the engine is open for extension without modifying existing code (respecting OCP). Moreover, isolating rules in this way makes them unit-testable and reliable – you can test each filter in isolation with sample data. As noted in design pattern literature, this approach keeps the rules “maintainable, unit-testable, and open to extension.” In practice, you might implement this with a list of filter classes or functions that the flight results pass through sequentially. Each filter either flags an offer as invalid or augments it, then passes the result to the next stage. This pipeline architecture guarantees that no flight can slip through without meeting all criteria, since an offer must survive every filter in sequence to be output.

Unified, Provider-Agnostic Filtering for Multiple Workflows
It’s critical to apply identical business rules to both the Amadeus search workflow and the Duffel auto-booking workflow, so we need a provider-agnostic filtering system. Achieve this by normalizing flight data from different providers into a common in-memory model before filtering. For example, define a FlightOffer interface or data structure that abstracts away whether the data came from Amadeus or Duffel. This could include properties like segments (with details to determine non-stop vs connecting), roundTrip flag or return segment present, basePrice, currency, includedCarryOn (boolean), totalPriceWithCarryOn, etc. Write small adapter functions that take Amadeus API responses (which use itineraries arrays) and Duffel API responses (which use slices and segments) and output a FlightOffer object. Now your filter pipeline can operate on FlightOffer uniformly, checking offer.segments.length to ensure non-stop, or computing prices, regardless of source. This ensures consistency – users will never see a flight in the app that wouldn’t pass the auto-booking filters, because the same code is used for both. The business rules (non-stop, round-trip, bags, budget, etc.) are encoded once in the filter modules and reused in both workflows. This design prevents divergence where the Amadeus front-end might allow something that the Duffel back-end would reject – a crucial point since such mismatches could cause attempted bookings of ineligible flights. In summary, one unified filtering engine is used for both search results and background booking, with provider-specific differences handled via a translation layer. This also simplifies maintenance: any rule change propagates everywhere, and new providers (e.g. other APIs) can be supported by adding a new adapter to the same filter engine.

Performance and Efficiency Considerations
Performance is paramount given the real-time search and frequent background checks. The architecture should minimize both latency and load:
Reduce API Load with Pre-Filters: As mentioned, use Amadeus query parameters to pre-filter whenever possible (non-stop, maxPrice, etc.) so we only deal with a manageable number of offers. Amadeus can return up to 250 offers by default, so applying nonStop=true and a reasonable maxPrice cuts down the data to process, speeding up the pipeline and lowering bandwidth usage.
Caching Strategy: Continue the approach of caching filtered results in the database (flight_offers_v2 table) for the front-end to query. This acts as a short-term cache so the user can reload or paginate results without triggering new API calls every time. However, implement a timely invalidation or refresh policy – for example, mark cached results with a timestamp and refresh them (by calling Amadeus again) if they’re more than X minutes old or if the user explicitly requests fresh data. This balances performance with accuracy (see “Real-Time Accuracy vs Caching” below). Cache can also be keyed by feature flag or user segment if A/B tests produce different result sets, ensuring each variant’s results are stored separately.
In-Memory Filtering Efficiency: The filter pipeline itself should be efficient in code. Processing, say, a few dozen or hundred offers in memory is fast in Node/TypeScript, but we should avoid any heavy computations in tight loops. Use efficient data structures (e.g., pre-compute a set of allowed airlines or time windows from user preferences once, rather than checking repeatedly inside each filter). Leverage vectorized operations where possible (like array filtering and mapping which are optimized in V8). Given the moderate data sizes post-API, this in-memory filtering will usually be a minor cost compared to network I/O.
Baggage Fee Computation: Computing the “true total price” with carry-on fees might require referencing external data (fee tables per airline or calling Duffel’s service info). To keep performance high, cache these fee lookups per request. For example, if multiple offers from the same airline fare class appear, compute the carry-on fee once and reuse it. If you have a computeCarryOnFee(offer) function that possibly queries Duffel’s available_services or an internal fee table, call it lazily and store results in a memo or in the offer object. This way you don’t duplicate work for identical airlines/fare types in one search.
Parallelization: If some filters involve I/O (for example, a filter that calls Duffel’s API to retrieve baggage allowance details for each offer), consider performing those in parallel or batching them. Ideally, design filters to be synchronous/pure when possible (e.g., use pre-fetched baggage fee info rather than calling inside the filter loop). If an asynchronous step is needed (like calling Duffel’s GET /offers/{id}?return_available_services=true to get baggage prices), you could fetch such data for all offers in parallel (up to rate limits) before the final filtering pass. But note that this adds network overhead; often it’s better to rely on internal data for known baggage fees to avoid slowing down user searches.
Limiting Results: If a user’s budget is very low or filters are very strict, Amadeus might return 0 or very few flights. Ensure the system handles small result sets gracefully – the filtering overhead in those cases is trivial, but we might consider not requesting an excessive number of results in the first place. Use Amadeus’s max parameter to limit how many offers it returns (for example, if we only ever display top 50 cheapest results, there’s no need to retrieve all 250). This reduces processing and makes it easier to stay within performance budgets.
Monitoring Performance: Build performance hooks into the pipeline. For instance, measure and log the time taken for each filter module and how many offers it filtered out. This can be as simple as capturing timestamps around each filter’s execution and logging something like “NonStopFilter: removed 0 offers, 50 remain, took 2ms”. Over time, these logs help identify any slow filters or unexpected bottlenecks (e.g., a baggage fee lookup taking too long). We could also integrate application performance monitoring to track these metrics in production. Given that filtering will run frequently (especially for background price monitoring jobs), even a small slowdown can aggregate, so continuous monitoring ensures we catch any inefficiency early.
In summary, the architecture leans on the upstream API for coarse filtering and caching for reuse, while the pipeline itself is kept lean and optimized. This ensures we meet performance needs both for user-facing quick searches and high-frequency automated checks.

Reliability and Rule Enforcement
Reliability means never violating the core business rules. The architecture should include safeguards and verifications to ensure no forbidden flight sneaks through:
Strict Sequencing and No Bypass: The filter pipeline must be the single gatekeeper for flights. Structure your code so that all flight offers, whether from search or booking monitoring, go through applyAllFilters() (for example) before being used or displayed. By centralizing this, you avoid the risk of a developer accidentally displaying raw API results somewhere without filtering. One way to enforce this is to give the filtering function the responsibility of writing to the flight_offers_v2 table – so only filtered data ever reaches the database/UI. This creates a clear separation: “API -> Filter Engine -> Database/UI”, with no alternate path.
Double-Check in Critical Path: For the auto-booking workflow, an extra layer of caution is warranted because money is at stake. Even after initial filtering, just before booking a flight via Duffel, perform a quick re-validation of the rules on that single offer. For example, confirm the flight is still non-stop and meets all criteria (it should, since it passed earlier, but re-check in case data changed). Also, recompute the carry-on inclusion and total price at booking time using the latest info (Duffel’s Get Offer with return_available_services=true gives up-to-date price and baggage info). This ensures that even if conditions changed between search and booking, we don’t violate the rules at purchase time.
Consistent Data Structures: As mentioned, use one normalized FlightOffer model. This not only helps code reuse, but also ensures reliability because you’re comparing apples to apples. For instance, define clearly how to interpret “non-stop” in this model (e.g., an offer has exactly one segment per outbound/return). If Duffel’s slices come as separate one-way slices, combine two slices into one object for round-trip or mark them accordingly so the RoundTripFilter knows how to validate it. Having these invariants in the model (like offer.outboundSegments and offer.returnSegments arrays) prevents mis-filtering due to structural differences.
Edge-case Handling: Prepare the filters to handle weird data gracefully. For example, if an airline’s API response lacks explicit baggage info, our filter for carry-on could default to assuming no carry-on included (and either exclude the offer or attempt to add a fee if we have a default fee). It’s better to be safe (exclude a flight that might violate a rule) than to accidentally allow it. Logging such cases for review is useful – e.g., “Warning: Could not determine carry-on inclusion for Offer X, excluding it as precaution.” This way, no flight that we aren’t certain about passes through.
Transactional Integrity: When persisting filtered results to the database, treat that save as part of the filtering transaction. If for some reason a database write fails or times out, ensure that doesn’t result in partial data shown to the user. Perhaps use an upsert where only one process writes the final set of results after all filters, so you don’t end up with some unfiltered data. In a serverless/Edge Function context, make sure to handle concurrency (if two filtering jobs run for the same trip, maybe due to rapid user refresh or overlapping background job, ensure they don’t mix writes – possibly by using separate IDs or a locking mechanism).
Test Coverage for Rule Enforcement: Include tests specifically for edge cases and boundary conditions of rules to guarantee reliability. For example, test that a flight with one stop is always filtered out, that a flight exactly at the user’s budget with baggage is included but $1 over is excluded, etc. These unit tests will act as a safety net to catch any code changes that might weaken a rule.
By designing with these reliability considerations, we ensure the filtering system is trustworthy. In an app where “bad” results could mean lost money or user trust, this is as important as functionality. The combination of a robust filtering pipeline and defensive checks at critical points will enforce the business rules without exception.

Maintainability, Configurability, and A/B Testing
To meet changing business needs, the filter system must be easy to modify or configure without breaking everything:
Central Configuration of Rules: Define a clear configuration structure for the filtering criteria. For instance, a JSON or TypeScript config object could list which filters are active, and any parameters for them (like budget threshold, allowed layover minutes, etc.). Today, many rules are “hard-coded” as always-on (non-stop, round-trip), but by reading from a config, you can later allow some to be toggled. This config can pull from your database or environment (for global toggles) and from user preferences (for user-specific overrides). For example, a user’s trip request might set nonstop_required=false – the filter engine can read that and either skip the NonStopFilter or run it conditionally. By isolating these flags, you avoid littering the code with if/else for preferences; instead each filter checks config at runtime.
Feature Flags Integration: Since you already have a feature_flags table and use an env flag like flight_search_v2_enabled, bake this into the architecture. You might maintain two sets of filters (e.g., old algorithm vs new algorithm) and choose which pipeline to execute based on the feature flag for that user/request. The design could have a higher-order “FilterEngine” that picks a pipeline variant. For A/B testing different combinations, you could even have multiple filter sequences defined in config and keyed by experiment ID. The system might do something like: const filters = featureFlag.isEnabled("new_filter") ? newFilters : defaultFilters; filteredOffers = applyFilters(filters, offers). The key is that adding or removing a filter for a test should not require a massive code refactor – it should be as simple as toggling a flag or adding the filter in one place. The pipeline model supports this since filters are composable and order-dependent; you can rearrange or swap out filters easily.
Clarity and Documentation: Keep the filtering logic modular and self-documenting. Each filter module/class should encapsulate one rule and be named clearly (e.g., NonStopFilter, CarryOnIncludedFilter, BudgetFilter). This makes the code readable and the intent clear to any developer. New engineers or contributors can quickly understand the business rules by looking at the list of filters. Inline comments and unit tests for each filter further serve as documentation of the expected behavior (e.g., a test name “should exclude flights with stops” is very clear).
Testability: The pipeline architecture inherently improves testability. Each filter’s logic can be unit tested with various inputs (including edge cases), and the composition of filters can be tested with integration tests (e.g., feed a mock list of flight offers through the whole pipeline and assert the outcome). Adopt a pattern of dependency injection where needed – for example, if CarryOnFeeFilter relies on a baggage fee lookup service, inject a mockable interface so tests can simulate different scenarios (airline A charges $X, airline B includes the bag, etc.). By writing thorough tests, you can confidently tweak or refactor filters knowing that any deviation from expected business rules will cause a test to fail.
Provider-Agnostic Testing: Since the same filters apply to Amadeus and Duffel data (via the normalized model), test with both types of input. Construct a sample Amadeus response and a sample Duffel offer that represent the same scenario and ensure the filters handle both identically. This will catch any assumptions in the code about data shape. It’s useful to have factory methods in tests like makeAmadeusOffer({…}) and makeDuffelOffer({…}) to generate comparable FlightOffer objects for testing.
Ease of Modification: When business rules change (say, we later allow 1-stop flights if user opts in), the changes should be localized. In this case, maybe the NonStopFilter would check a flag or user preference. Or if we add a new rule (e.g., “exclude red-eye flights departing 12am–5am”), we can create a RedEyeFilter and add it to the pipeline without touching the others. This modularity avoids regression risks in unrelated rules when making changes.
In summary, centralizing the filtering logic and parameterizing it makes it straightforward to maintain. Paired with feature flags and testing, we can evolve the system (or run experiments) with minimal risk. The architecture anticipates future needs like user-specific rules and ensures we can implement those simply by feeding the right parameters into the existing pipeline.

Edge Case Handling and Fallback Strategies
Edge cases are anticipated and addressed in this architecture so that the system remains robust under unusual conditions:

1. No Results from Strict Filtering
When the combined filters are very strict, it’s possible to get 0 flight results. For example, a remote route with no non-stop flights, or a very low budget that eliminates all options once baggage fees are added. The system handles this gracefully:
Detecting No-Result Scenarios: After the Amadeus API call and in-memory filtering, if the result set is empty, the code can trigger a specific “no flights found” path. This could log the event (for analytical tracking) and inform the front-end to display a friendly message to the user. It’s important to distinguish “no flights found after applying our business rules” from an API error – the user messaging might encourage them to adjust search criteria or preferences.
Automatic Relaxation (Future Enhancement): While the current business rules are non-negotiable, the architecture leaves room for a fallback search strategy. For instance, you could implement a tiered filtering approach: if no results, optionally retry a search with slightly relaxed criteria (maybe allow 1 stop or exclude the carry-on rule but mark those results clearly). This would only be done if business decides some flexibility is allowed. The pipeline could support marking certain filters as “soft” vs “hard” and have logic to drop soft filters if needed. However, given today’s requirements, the safer approach is to return no results rather than show violating flights. So, our primary fallback is just a clear UX message (“No flights found that meet your criteria”) and potentially an invite to widen preferences (e.g., “consider increasing your budget or allowing connecting flights”).
Amadeus 0-results vs Post-filter 0-results: If Amadeus itself returns 0 (say, because we used nonStop=true and truly no direct flights exist), that saves computation – we know immediately. In scenarios where Amadeus returns some flights but all get filtered out (commonly due to budget after adding carry-on fees), we might consider surfacing that information: e.g., “Flights were found, but all exceeded your budget once carry-on fees were included.” This transparency can be valuable to users. The system can detect this by comparing the count of raw offers vs filtered offers. If raw > 0 and filtered = 0, the reason is likely our post-filters, so we can relay a message (and possibly include a reason, if one stands out like budget). This is an optional UX improvement; technically the system is just enforcing rules, but providing context can improve user trust.
Background Job Behavior: In the auto-booking context, if filtering yields no eligible flights to monitor, the background process can sleep or terminate gracefully. It should not keep retrying aggressively if it’s a static scenario (e.g., no flights will magically appear if none exist). Perhaps it could re-run at a lower frequency or notify that no options meet criteria. This prevents wasteful polling when no results are expected.

2. Airlines with Different Carry-On Policies (Basic Economy vs Regular)
Airlines vary widely in baggage policies – some include a carry-on by default, others (e.g., United Basic Economy) include only a personal item. The filtering system addresses this by incorporating baggage allowance awareness:
Amadeus Data Utilization: The Amadeus Flight Offers Search response often includes baggage details per fare. For example, in the fareDetailsBySegment you may see an amenity like “CARRY ON HAND BAGGAGE” with isChargeable: false or true, indicating if a carry-on is included. Our filter logic should parse this for each offer. If a carry-on is included (isChargeable=false), great – it meets rule #3 directly. If it’s not included (isChargeable=true or the data indicates 0 carry-on allowance), then the filter will consider the carry-on fee.
Fee Calculation: We have a computeCarryOnFee() utility that, given an offer, determines the cost of adding a carry-on. This likely uses a lookup table of airlines or fare brands to fees, or calls an API like Duffel’s available_services. For instance, Duffel’s offer data can provide an ancillary service of type “baggage” with a price. Our system can retrieve that either from Duffel (for NDC carriers) or from an internal mapping. The filter will then add that fee to the flight’s price to compute a “true total”. This addresses rule #4: if adding the carry-on fee pushes the total above the user’s budget, the Budget filter will drop the flight.
Excluding Non-compliant Fares: If an airline’s lowest fare doesn’t include a carry-on, the filter essentially forces either including the fee or exclusion. In some cases, an airline might not even allow purchasing a carry-on (they might simply not allow any carry-on for basic economy – you’d have to buy a higher fare class). In those cases, since the rule is personal + carry-on must be included in the price, the filter should exclude such flights entirely (because there’s no way to satisfy the requirement except by upgrading the fare, which our search might not be doing automatically). Fortunately, many airlines do allow a carry-on as an ancillary purchase or have a next tier fare; but our engine should err on the side of caution: if we cannot guarantee the carry-on can be included, we will not show that flight.
Multiple Fare Options (Branded Fares): In cases where Amadeus returns multiple fare options for the same flight (e.g., “Economy Basic” vs “Economy Standard”), the filtering could choose the one that includes carry-on. Amadeus has a Branded Fares Upsell mechanism, but in the search response itself, sometimes you get separate offers for different fare brands. Our filters might drop the “Basic” fare offer and keep the “Standard” fare offer, because the latter includes the bag. This way, the user only sees the option that aligns with rules. If only Basic is returned, we treat it as above (add fee or exclude).
Data structure for allowances: Internally, we might maintain a map like airlineCarryOnPolicy that says e.g., { "UA:Basic": carryOnAllowed=false, carryOnFee=not allowed, "UA:Regular": carryOnAllowed=true }, or more generically use the fare family name (Amadeus provides brandedFare like “LITE” in the example). This can help the filter make decisions without heavy logic. Over time, this table can be refined as we learn different airlines’ policies. The architecture allows plugging in such a table or even making it data-driven from the DB, so that non-developers could update a fee or policy if needed.
Testing edge cases: Make sure to test scenarios like: Airline A includes carry-on (filter should pass it under budget), Airline B doesn’t but fee keeps it under budget (filter should include it after adding fee), Airline C doesn’t and adding fee makes it too expensive (filter out), Airline D doesn’t allow carry-on at all (filter out). These cover all possible outcomes for this rule.
By handling carry-on logic in detail, the system ensures that no flight violating the intent (“user can bring a personal item + carry-on without surprises”) will appear. This is a key value proposition of Parker Flight, so the architecture treats it with first-class importance in the filtering pipeline.

3. Price Fluctuations Between Search and Booking
In the time gap between showing search results (from Amadeus) and actually booking a ticket (via Duffel, possibly minutes or hours later in an auto-book scenario), prices can change. Our architecture deals with this in a few ways:
Real-time Price Confirmation: As part of the booking workflow, always retrieve the latest price from Duffel before finalizing. Duffel’s API documentation explicitly advises calling “Get a single offer” to get up-to-date pricing, noting that the offer might change (e.g., total_amount). We will do this and use the returned total_amount as the authoritative price at booking time. If this price has increased beyond the user’s budget (especially after adding any services like baggage), the booking module should abort or require re-approval. Essentially, treat the budget as a hard cap even at booking time.
Hold and Revalidate: If possible, one could lock in prices (some APIs allow holding a reservation for a short time). Duffel may not support holding without booking, but at minimum, our system can shorten the window of discrepancy by doing frequent updates. For example, the background monitor can call Amadeus and update the cached price periodically. If a price is creeping up, we might catch it and update our data. This won’t prevent change at booking time, but reduces the surprise delta.
User Transparency: For user-facing searches, since we redirect to the airline’s site for booking, we should present a disclaimer that “prices are subject to change until booking.” However, because Parker Flight’s USP is including baggage in shown price, we do our best to keep that accurate up to the minute of search. We might not do continuous updates on the front-end, but even caching strategy can lean towards fresh data (e.g., every new search query hits the live API rather than a stale cache).
Tolerance and Fallback: Decide what to do if a price change is detected at booking time. If the change is minor (say a few dollars due to currency or tax changes), the system might still proceed if it remains under budget, or if over budget by a negligible amount, maybe proceed if business allows a small buffer. But likely, the rule is strict: do not book if over budget. In that case, the auto-book function should gracefully not execute the purchase, and perhaps log or notify that “Booking skipped because price changed from $X to $Y exceeding budget.” This ties into reliability – it’s better to miss a booking than to violate the budget guarantee.
Currency Conversion Factor: Sometimes fluctuations appear if currency conversions are in play (next section). We can mitigate surprises by using consistent currency (e.g., always search and book in the same currency if possible). If the booking must happen in a different currency, build in a slight buffer for conversion rate changes or fees.
In essence, the system never assumes a price quote is final. It actively checks and rechecks at critical points, ensuring that the final transaction never exceeds what was promised. This reduces failed bookings and negative user experiences due to price changes.

4. Multiple Currency Handling
Multi-currency scenarios add complexity in budget enforcement and price display. Here’s how the architecture copes:
Unified Currency for Comparison: It’s easiest to compare prices and budgets in the same currency. We leverage Amadeus’s ability to return prices in a specified currency (via currencyCode parameter) so that the initial search results are in the user’s preferred or home currency. If the user’s budget is, say, $1000, we request prices in USD. This avoids having to convert at the comparison moment for search results. On the Duffel side, offers will be in our organization’s billing currency (which could be USD or something else) unless the airline pricing is inherently in another currency. We may need to convert Duffel prices to the user’s currency when comparing to budget. Using a reliable exchange rate source (possibly Amadeus has a currency conversion utility, or we use a financial API) is key. The conversion should include any expected spread or fee (if we want to be safe, maybe use a slightly padded rate to avoid underestimating costs).
Storing Currency Info: Each FlightOffer in our system should carry a currency field alongside prices. The filters especially the budget filter should be aware of currency. A robust design is to convert all prices to a common internal currency (e.g., USD) for filtering logic, then convert back for display. For example, if a user’s budget is in EUR and flights are priced in GBP, convert everything to (say) cents in USD internally, compare, then convert the final totals back to EUR for showing. This ensures consistency in comparisons.
Currency Conversion Updates: Currency rates can fluctuate, though not usually dramatically in the short term. If an offer is being monitored over days, the conversion from, say, EUR to USD could drift. For long-running background jobs, consider updating exchange rates periodically. You could integrate with a daily FX rate service or use Amadeus’s reference data if available (they have a Currency Conversion API in enterprise but for self-service one might use an external API or library of rates). The point is to ensure that if 1 USD = 0.90 EUR today but 0.88 EUR tomorrow, the budget check accounts for that if needed.
Display and User Input: Allow users to input budget in their currency and display flight prices in that currency to avoid confusion. Under the hood, convert as needed but present a seamless experience. If multi-currency handling is all internal, users won’t be exposed to it except maybe a note like “Prices converted from GBP, subject to exchange rate differences.”
Rounding Issues: Be careful with rounding when converting currencies. Always do comparisons in a minor unit (cents, etc.) to avoid rounding errors causing an off-by-one that might include a flight slightly over budget. For example, if budget is $100.00 and a flight costs £75.00, depending on rate you might get $100.002 equivalent – which should be considered over. It’s safer to enforce a strict <= budget after rounding up to a safe margin.
Overall, the system uses currency conversion to its advantage (getting prices in a single currency when possible), and where not, it handles conversions explicitly with up-to-date rates. This way, a user’s budget constraint is honored globally, even if an itinerary’s components cross currency lines.

5. Caching Results vs Real-Time Accuracy
Caching can greatly improve performance and cost, but it must be balanced against the need for real-time price accuracy:
Database Cache (flight_offers_v2): As described, after filtering a search result, we store it in the DB. This cached data is used for quick display and possibly for the user to come back to their search without re-calling Amadeus immediately. We should implement a short TTL (time-to-live) for these cached offers. For instance, we might consider flight offers valid for 10 minutes for viewing purposes. After that, the front-end could warn “Results may be outdated – refresh search.” We could also automatically purge or mark stale entries in the table after some time.
Background Cache: In the auto-booking scenario, caching is slightly less relevant, since we’re continuously polling or watching. However, if the background job finds an eligible offer and is waiting for conditions (like price drop under threshold), it might store that offer ID and periodically re-fetch its price. It could cache the last seen price to decide if it dropped. Essentially the background process itself acts as a cache, with logic like “if last price known was $X, check again after Y minutes”.
Refreshing Mechanism: One approach for the user-facing side is to always perform a fresh Amadeus query when the user initiates a new search, but then serve subsequent interactions (like pagination or sorting) from the cached results for that search. If the user repeats the same search (same origin/dest and dates) within a short time, we could either use the cached results (fast but possibly stale) or treat it as a new search call (slower but up-to-date). A compromise is to use an etag or hash of query parameters as a key in cache: if the same search is requested within, say, 5 minutes, use cached data; beyond that, hit the API again. This prevents showing very stale prices without user action.
Real-Time Overrides: Certain user actions should always trigger real-time data. For example, if user clicks “Book” on a result (which redirects to airline), we might at that moment call Amadeus Flight Price API or Duffel to double-check the price and availability of that one offer, updating the UI if needed (“price just updated to $XYZ”). This ensures the final step the user sees is accurate, even if the listing they clicked was cached from a few minutes ago.
Caching and Feature Flags: Ensure that caching doesn’t mix data between different filter sets. If flight_search_v2 (a new algorithm) is enabled for some users, their results cache should be tagged so that a user in Group A (old filters) and Group B (new filters) both searching the same route get their respective filtered results, not a shared cache. This might mean the cache key includes the feature flag or filter version.
Maintaining Accuracy: For auto-booking, accuracy is paramount, so caching is used only for short intervals to reduce API spam. The system could employ exponential backoff if nothing is changing – e.g., check price every 5 minutes, if it hasn’t changed in a while, maybe slow to 15 minutes, etc., but as soon as a threshold is crossed or volatility is detected, act immediately.
In conclusion, caching is used thoughtfully: we cache to optimize performance and avoid redundant work, but we never rely on stale data for critical decisions. The architecture always has a path to refresh data when needed (especially when money will be spent or when showing final prices to user), thereby balancing speed and accuracy.

Example: Filter Pipeline Implementation (TypeScript)
Below is a simplified example of how one might implement the described filtering system in TypeScript. This illustrates the filter interface, composing multiple filters, error handling, performance logging, and unit test structure:

// Define a normalized FlightOffer interface to use across providers
interface FlightOffer {
  provider: 'Amadeus' | 'Duffel';
  // Basic flight info
  itineraries: Itinerary[];         // e.g., [outboundSegments, returnSegments]
  totalBasePrice: number;           // base price excluding carry-on fee
  currency: string;                 // currency code for prices (e.g., "USD")
  // Baggage info
  carryOnIncluded: boolean;         // whether a carry-on bag is already included
  carryOnFee?: number;              // fee for adding a carry-on if not included (in same currency)
  // Derived info
  totalPriceWithCarryOn: number;    // totalBasePrice + (carryOnIncluded ? 0 : carryOnFee)
  stopsCount: number;               // total number of stops (sum of segments - number of itineraries)
  // ... other fields like airline, departure times, etc.
}

Explanation of the code example:
We define a FlightFilter interface with an apply method, so each filter knows how to filter a list of offers. In practice, some filters (like CarryOnPricingFilter) might transform offers (adding the fee) rather than remove them; it still fits in the pipeline because it returns the altered list (not removing any in that step, just preparing data for the next filter).
The FilterContext carries the user’s budget, preferences, and a hook for performance logging. This context can be expanded to include feature flags or experiment identifiers if needed (filters could behave differently based on flags).
Composing Filters: The applyFilters function creates the sequence of filter objects and applies them in order. The output of each becomes input to the next. This matches the conceptual pipeline (Pipe-and-Filter) design, and you can easily add or remove filters from this array to adjust the logic. For an A/B test, you might have two versions of this array or conditionally include a filter.
Error Handling: In CarryOnPricingFilter, we wrap the fee computation in a try/catch. If something goes wrong (e.g., missing data or API failure), we handle it by logging an error and marking the offer’s price as infinity (effectively ensuring it will be filtered out by the BudgetFilter or any reasonable check). This way, a failure in auxiliary data doesn’t break the whole search – it just excludes that problematic offer. We prefer to be safe (exclude a possibly valid flight if we can’t confirm it meets all rules) rather than risk including a flight that violates the carry-on rule. Such errors should be rare if data normalization is done properly, but the safeguard is useful.
Performance Logging: Each filter logs how many offers were removed and how long it took. For example, you might see in logs: “NonStopFilter: 30 -> 30 offers (0 removed) in 5ms, RoundTripFilter: 30 -> 30 offers in 1ms, CarryOnPricingFilter: 30 -> 30 in 10ms, BudgetFilter: 30 -> 28 in 2ms”. This tells us two offers were over budget and got cut. Such logs help in monitoring and can be tied into metrics dashboards.
Unit Testing Patterns: With this design, you can test each filter in isolation. For instance, create a dummy list of offers with some having stops and some non-stop, then pass them to NonStopFilter.apply and assert that only non-stop remain. Similarly test BudgetFilter by setting different budgets in context. The CarryOnPricingFilter can be tested by providing offers with known carryOnIncluded true/false and perhaps stubbing computeCarryOnFeeForOffer (in a real design, you might inject a service into the filter rather than calling a global function, to mock it in tests). Also test the integration: create a set of offers with a mixture of rule violations and ensure applyFilters yields the correct final set. For the Duffel vs Amadeus differences, you’d ensure that in the normalization step (not shown in code), you fill in carryOnIncluded and carryOnFee appropriately for each provider so that the filters operate correctly. Those normalization functions (makeFlightOfferFromAmadeus(apiData) etc.) should also be unit tested with sample API responses.

This code is an illustrative starting point. In a real system, you would enrich it with more robust data handling (especially baggage fees and currency conversion), and likely more filters. But it demonstrates how an extensible, maintainable filter pipeline can be implemented to meet Parker Flight’s requirements. Each filter cleanly encapsulates a rule, the pipeline enforces all rules reliably, and the whole setup is easy to test and tweak – striking the desired balance of performance, maintainability, and strict business rule compliance.
