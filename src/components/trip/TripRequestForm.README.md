# TripRequestForm â€” Phase 1 Notes

Scope: Correctness and stability only. No visual restyle or routing changes.

What changed
- Validation: Centralized Zod schema with preprocess/superRefine (src/types/form.ts) and zodResolver in the form.
- A11y: Field wiring via FormControl/FormMessage (aria-invalid + aria-describedby) and an assertive live region for error summary; focus moves to first invalid field.
- Submit robustness: AbortController guards in-flight requests on unmount; idempotency key generation; retries around repository ops; flight search invocation non-blocking with a graceful fallback toast.
- Minimal component split preserved (FormProvider + sections); visual layout unchanged.

How to verify
- Schema unit tests: src/types/__tests__/form.schema.test.ts
- Integration tests (added):
  - tests/integration/tripRequestForm.submit.success.integration.test.tsx
  - tests/integration/tripRequestForm.submit.500.integration.test.tsx
- Manual smoke: run dev, fill destination/airports/dates/price; submit; verify navigation to /trip/offers and no crash if search fails.

Notes
- Tests are fully offline and mock Supabase and edge calls. No real keys required.
- Retry semantics are conservative for repository/database operations; external HTTP retries (5xx-only) are implemented in retryHttpRequest when used.
