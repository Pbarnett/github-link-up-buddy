# Root Account Break-Glass Procedure

## When to Use Root Account
The root account should ONLY be used in the following emergency situations:

1. **IAM System Failure**: All IAM users and roles are inaccessible
2. **Account Recovery**: Locked out of all administrative access
3. **Billing Issues**: Cannot access billing information through IAM
4. **Support Cases**: AWS Support requires root account access

## Pre-Emergency Preparation

### Root Account Security
- [ ] Root account has strong unique password
- [ ] MFA is enabled on root account
- [ ] Root account email is monitored
- [ ] No access keys exist for root account
- [ ] Contact information is up to date

### Documentation
- [ ] Root account credentials are stored in secure vault
- [ ] Break-glass procedure is documented and tested
- [ ] Emergency contact list is maintained
- [ ] Incident response team is identified

## Emergency Access Procedure

### Step 1: Authorization
1. Get approval from at least 2 senior team members
2. Document the emergency situation
3. Create incident ticket with justification

### Step 2: Access
1. Retrieve root credentials from secure vault
2. Log all actions taken with root account
3. Use root account for minimum necessary actions only

### Step 3: Post-Emergency
1. Change root account password
2. Review all actions taken during emergency
3. Update IAM policies to prevent future lockouts
4. Document lessons learned
5. Update break-glass procedure if needed
